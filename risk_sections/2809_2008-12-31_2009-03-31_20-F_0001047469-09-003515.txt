"measured mineral resource" The part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters and to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. While this term is recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the SEC does not recognize it. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in this category will ever be converted into reserves. "Merrill Crowe process" A separation technique for removing gold from a cyanide solution. The solution is separated from the ore by methods such as filtration and counter current decantation, and then the gold is cemented by adding zinc dust, which precipitates the gold (zinc has a higher affinity for the cyanide ion than gold). Silver and copper may also precipitate. The precipitate is further refined, e.g., by smelting, to remove the zinc and by treating with nitric acid to dissolve the silver. "metallurgical properties" Properties characterizing metals and minerals behaviour towards various processing techniques. 63 "metamorphism" The process by which the form or structure of sedimentary or igneous rocks is changed by heat and pressure. "metasedimentary" A sedimentary rock that shows evidence of having been changed in form or structure by heat and pressure. "mineral reserve" The economically mineable part of a measured or indicated resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study.

ITEM 5 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS Results of Operations Revenues from Mining Operations In 2008, revenue from mining operations decreased 15% to $369 million from $432 million in 2007. The decrease in revenue was driven by the sharp decrease in zinc and copper prices and the decrease in production of all byproduct metals. This was partially offset by increased gold production and prices. The increase in gold production is attributable to the mid-year opening of the new Goldex Mine in northwestern Quebec. In 2008, sales of gold and silver accounted for 78% of revenues, up from 56% in 2007 and up from 47% in 2006. The increase in the percentage of revenues from precious metals when compared to 2007 is largely due to the increase in gold prices and production and sharp decreases in the prices of byproduct zinc and copper. Revenues from mining operations are accounted for net of related smelting, refining, transportation and other charges. The table below sets out net revenue, production volumes and sales volumes by metal: 2008 2007 2006 Revenues from mining operations (thousands): Gold $ 227,576 $ 171,537 $ 159,815 Silver 59,398 70,028 58,262 Zinc 54,364 156,340 211,871 Copper 27,600 34,300 34,684 $ 368,938 $ 432,205 $ 464,632 Production volumes: Gold (ounces) 276,762 230,992 245,826 Silver (000s ounces) 4,079 4,920 4,956 Zinc (tonnes) 65,755 71,577 82,183 Copper (tonnes) 6,922 7,482 7,289 Sales volumes: Gold (ounces) 258,601 229,316 256,961 Silver (000s ounces) 4,023 5,171 4,739 Zinc (tonnes) 62,653 72,905 81,689 Copper (tonnes) 6,913 7,466 7,302 Revenue from gold sales increased $56 million, or 33%, in 2008. Gold production increased to 276,762 ounces in 2008, up 20% from 230,992 ounces in 2007. The increase is attributable to the commencement of production at the new Goldex Mine during mid-year 2008. Realized gold prices increased 18% in 2008 to $879 per ounce from $748 per ounce in 2007. Silver revenue decreased $11 million, or 15%, in 2008. The $11 million decrease was mostly attributable due to lower silver production. Revenue from zinc sales decreased $102 million, or 65%, in 2008 when compared to 2007. The decrease in zinc revenue was due to 41% lower realized prices as well as an 14% decrease in sales volume. Revenue from copper sales decreased by 20% when compared to 2007. This was due to a decrease of 11% in the realized sales price of copper and a decrease in sales volume of 7%. Total fourth quarter revenue decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to the significant decrease in revenue from in zinc, copper and silver production, which was partially offset by the increase in revenue from gold production. 67 Interest and Sundry Income Interest and sundry income consists mainly of interest on cash balances. Interest and sundry income was $11.7 million in 2008 compared to $25.1 million in 2007. The $13.4 million decrease was attributable to the significantly lower average cash balance held during 2008 compared to 2007 in combination with lower realized interest rates. Available-for-sale Securities From time to time, the Company takes minority equity positions in other mining and exploration companies. In 2008, as part of its procedures to assess the value of the Company's available-for-sale securities portfolio was reasonable for accounting purposes, it was determined in accordance with the requirements of FASB Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("FAS 115"), that a non-cash write-down was required. These write-downs do not necessarily reflect management's long-term outlook on the value of the securities, but rather an "other-than-temporary" impairment as defined in FAS 115 for various investments amounting to $74.8 million. There were no such write-downs in 2007. In 2008 the sale of various available-for-sale securities resulted in a gain before taxes of $25.6 million compared to $4.1 million in 2007. The larger gain in 2008 is directly attributable to the Company's investment in Gold Eagle Mines Ltd. ("Gold Eagle"). The Company acquired securities of Gold Eagle during the second quarter of 2008 for $49.4 million. In the third quarter, the Company sold the shares into a successful take-over bid for Gold Eagle at a price per share significantly above the Company's acquisition cost of the Gold Eagle securities. In addition, during the third quarter, the Company made a strategic investment in Comaplex Minerals Corp. ("Comaplex") for $46.7 million by purchasing 7,628,571 common shares, or approximately 14.5%, of Comaplex from another mining company. As of December 31, 2008, the Company owns a total of 8,228,571 common shares, or approximately 15.6% of Comaplex. Production Costs In 2008, total production costs were $186.9 million compared to $166.1 million in 2007. This increase is due to the start of production at the new Goldex Mine in northwest Quebec, which commenced production during 2008. The table below sets out the components of production costs: Production Costs 2008 2007 2006 (thousands) Production costs at LaRonde $ 166,496 $ 166,104 $ 143,753 Production costs at Goldex 20,366   Production costs per Consolidated Statement of Income $ 186,862 $ 166,104 $ 143,753 Production costs at the LaRonde Mine remained relatively constant during 2008 at $166.5 million when compared to 2007. In 2007, production costs increased 16% to $166.1 million from $143.8 million in 2006. During 2008, LaRonde processed an average of 7,210 tonnes of ore per day compared to 7,325 tonnes of ore per day during 2007. While the design capacity of the plant is 6,350 tonnes per day, it has been operating at an average of approximately 7,286 tonnes per day for three years. Minesite costs per tonne were C$64 in the fourth quarter compared to C$65 in the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year, the minesite costs per tonne were C$67, compared with C$66 per tonne in 2007. The increase in minesite costs per tonne during 2008 is attributable to the higher average fuel and other input costs compared to 2007. In 2008, production costs at the Goldex Mine were $20.4 million since the commencement of commercial production on August 1, 2008. Since commercial production was achieved on August 1, 2008, Goldex has processed an average of 5,559 tonnes of ore per day, while the design capacity of the plant is 7,000 tonnes per day. The lower production 68 rates were associated with the ramp up of the Goldex Mine during the early stages of commercial production. For 2008, the minesite costs per tonne were C$27. In 2008, total cash costs per ounce of gold increased to $162 from minus $365 in 2007 and minus $690 in 2006. The total cash costs per ounce of $162 represents a weighted average between the LaRonde Mine total cash costs per ounce of $106 and the Goldex Mine total cash costs per ounce of $419. Total cash costs per ounce are comprised of minesite costs and, in the case of the LaRonde Mine, reduced by the net silver, zinc and copper revenue. Total cash costs per ounce are affected by various factors such as the number of gold ounces produced, operating costs, Canadian dollar/US dollar exchange rates, quantity of byproduct metals produced at the LaRonde Mine and byproduct metal prices. The table below illustrates the annual variance in the LaRonde Mine's total cash costs per ounce attributable to each of these factors. The most significant factor contributing to the increase in total cash costs per ounce in 2008 was lower byproduct revenue which resulted mainly from lower zinc and copper prices. 2008 2007 Total cash costs per ounce prior year $ (365 ) $ (690 ) Difference in gold production 46 40 Stronger Canadian dollar 2 49 Costs associated with increased fuel, reagent and steel costs 6 45 Byproduct revenue 417 191 Total cash costs per ounce current year $ 106 $ (365 ) Total cash costs per ounce is not a recognized measure under US GAAP and this data may not be comparable to data presented by other gold producers. Management believes that this generally accepted industry measure is a realistic indication of operating performance and is useful in allowing year over year comparisons. As illustrated in the table below, this measure is calculated by adjusting production costs as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for net byproduct revenues, royalties, inventory adjustments and asset retirement provisions and then dividing by the number of ounces of gold produced. Total cash costs per ounce is intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capabilities of mining operations. Management uses this measure to monitor the performance of mining operations. Since market prices for gold are quoted on a per ounce basis, using this per ounce measure allows management to assess the mine's cash generating capabilities at various gold prices. Management is aware that this per ounce measure of performance is affected by fluctuations in byproduct metal prices and exchange rates. Management compensates for the limitations inherent in this measure by using it in conjunction with minesite cost per tonne (discussed below) as well as other data prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Management also performs sensitivity analyses in order to quantify the effects of fluctuating metal prices and exchange rates. Minesite cost per tonne is not a recognized measure under US GAAP and this data may not be comparable to data presented by other gold producers. As illustrated in the table below, this measure is calculated by adjusting production costs as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income for royalties, inventory and hedging adjustments and asset retirement provisions and then dividing by tonnes of ore processed through the mill. Since total cash costs per ounce data can be affected by fluctuations in byproduct metal prices and exchange rates, management believes this measure provides additional information regarding the performance of mining operations and allows management to monitor operating costs on a more consistent basis as the per tonne measure eliminates the cost variability associated with varying production levels. Management also uses this measure to determine the economic viability of mining blocks. As each mining block is evaluated based on the net realizable value of each tonne mined, in order to be economically viable the estimated revenue on a per tonne basis must be in excess of the minesite costs per tonne. Management is aware that this per tonne measure is affected by fluctuations in production levels and thus uses this measure as an evaluation tool in conjunction with production costs prepared in accordance with US GAAP. This measure supplements production cost information prepared in accordance with US GAAP and allows investors to distinguish between changes in production costs resulting from changes in level of production versus changes in operating performance. 69 Both of these non-US GAAP measures used should be considered together with other data prepared in accordance with US GAAP, and none of the measures taken by themselves is necessarily indicative of production costs or cash flow measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The tables below reconcile total cash costs per ounce and minesite costs per tonne to the production costs presented in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

Since total cash costs per ounce are calculated on a production basis, this inventory adjustment reflects the sales margin on the portion of concentrate production for which revenue has not been recognized in the period. (ii)Total cash costs is not a recognized measure under US GAAP and this data may not be comparable to data presented by other gold producers. The Company believes that this generally accepted industry measure is a realistic indication of operating performance and is useful in allowing year over year comparisons. As illustrated in the table above, this measure is calculated by adjusting Production Costs as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for net byproduct revenues, royalties, inventory adjustments and asset retirement provisions. This measure is intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capabilities of the Company's mining operations. Management uses this measure to monitor the performance of the Company's mining operations. Since market prices for gold are quoted on a per ounce basis, using this per ounce measure allows management to assess the mine's cash generating capabilities at various gold prices. Management is aware that this per ounce measure of performance can be impacted by fluctuations in byproduct metal prices and exchange rates. Management compensates for the limitation inherent with this measure by using it in conjunction with the minesite costs per tonne measure (discussed below) as well as other data prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Management also performs sensitivity analyses in order to quantify the effects of fluctuating metal prices and exchange rates. (iii)This inventory adjustment reflects production costs associated with unsold concentrates. (iv)Minesite costs per tonne is not a recognized measure under US GAAP and this data may not be comparable to data presented by other gold producers. As illustrated in the table above, this measure is calculated by adjusting Production Costs as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for inventory and hedging adjustments and asset retirement provisions and then dividing by tonnes processed through the mill. Since total cash costs data can be affected by fluctuations in byproduct metal prices and exchange rates, management believes minesite costs per tonne provides additional information regarding the performance of mining operations and allows management to monitor operating costs on a more consistent basis as the per tonne measure eliminates the cost variability associated with varying production levels. Management also uses this measure to determine the economic viability of mining blocks. As each mining block is evaluated based on the net realizable value of each tonne mined, in order to be economically viable the estimated revenue on a per tonne basis must be in excess of the minesite costs per tonne. Management is aware that this per tonne measure is impacted by fluctuations in production levels and thus uses this evaluation tool in conjunction with production costs prepared in accordance with US GAAP. This measure supplements production cost information prepared in accordance with US GAAP and allows investors to distinguish between changes in production costs resulting from changes in production versus changes in operating performance. The Company's operating results and cash flow are significantly affected by changes in the US dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate. Exchange rate movements can have a significant impact as all of the Company's revenues are earned in US dollars but most of its operating costs and a substantial portion of its capital costs are in Canadian dollars. The US dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate has varied significantly over the last several years. During the period from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008, the noon buying rate, as reported by the Bank of Canada, fluctuated from a high of $1.3970 to a low of $0.9059. In addition, a significant portion of the Company's expenditures at the Kittila Mine and the Pinos Altos mine project are denominated in Euros and Mexican pesos, respectively. Each of these currencies has varied significantly against the US dollar over the past several years as well. 71 Exploration and Corporate Development Expense In 2008, the Company continued its significant exploration and corporate development activities including those set out below: During 2008, exploration expenditures at the Kittila Mine in northern Finland were $7.0 million, an increase of $1.3 million when compared to 2007. As a result of these exploration activities, the proven and probable gold reserves increased to 3.2 million ounces and more than doubled the inferred gold resource. The increase in the reserves is mainly attributable to the underground exploration on the main Suuri and Roura zones. During 2008, approximately $7.4 million of exploration expenses were incurred at the Pinos Altos mine project in Mexico. These activities focused on converting resources to reserves in the Creston Mascota area, the San Eligio area and at the main mine development area. These activities resulted in an approximately a 1.1 million ounce increase in gold reserves and a 27 million ounce increase in silver reserves. Canadian grassroots exploration expenditure was $8.0 million in 2008. A significant portion of this amount was spent on exploration activities in the Nunavut area around Meadowbank. The exploration campaign commenced in March 2008 with a diamond drilling program followed by regional prospecting through early September 2008. In addition, a Western Canadian office was opened during the year, which focuses on earlier stage and grass roots opportunities. The Company is currently conducting exploration activities in Nevada and incurred exploration expenditures of $9.3 million during 2008, an increase of $4.2 million compared to 2007. The increase is attributable to additional drilling of high grade gold intercepts at the West Pequop project in Nevada. Additionally, the Company incurred expenditures relating to the purchase of additional claims, leases and road building. The table below sets out exploration expense by country and total corporate development expense: 2008 2007 2006 (thousands) United States 9,347 5,084 3,780 Canada 7,966 5,276 6,276 Mexico 7,426 6,047 8,017 Finland 7,017 5,719 9,843 Corporate development expense 2,948 3,381 3,161 $ 34,704 $ 25,507 $ 31,077 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased to $47.2 million in 2008 from $38.2 million in 2007. The main driver was an increase in stock option expense that was a combination of an increase in number of options granted plus an increase in the Black-Scholes calculated value of the options granted. Of the total general and administrative expense, stock-based compensation was $15.3 million and $9.8 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Provincial Capital Taxes Provincial capital taxes were $5.3 million in 2008 compared to $3.2 million in 2007. These taxes are assessed on the Company's capitalization (paid-up capital and debt) less certain allowances and tax credits for exploration expenses incurred. This increase is attributable to the increased debt and increased share capital in 2008. However, capital taxes should decrease in the future since the Ontario capital tax is expected to be eliminated by July 1, 2010 and the Quebec capital tax is expected to be eliminated by January 1, 2011. 72 Amortization Expense The consolidated amortization expense for the year increased to $36.1 million in 2008 compared to $27.8 million in 2007 largely as a result of the commencement of commercial production at the Goldex Mine during 2008. The total Goldex Mine amortization expense in 2008 was $7.3 million compared to nil in 2007. Interest Expense In 2008, interest expense decreased to $3.0 million from $3.3 million in 2007 and $2.9 million in 2006. The table below shows the components of interest expense. 2008 2007 2006 (thousands) Stand-by fees on credit facilities $ 1,163 $ 2,289 $ 1,201 Amortization of credit facilities and convertible subordinated debenture financing costs 1,192 806 763 Other interest expense 597 199 132 Interest on credit facilities 4,584   Interest rate derivative payments   442 Interest on convertible subordinated debentures   689 Interest capitalized to construction in progress (4,584 )  (325 ) $ 2,952 $ 3,294 $ 2,902 Foreign Currency Translation Gain The foreign currency translation gain was $77.7 million in 2008 compared to a loss of $32.3 million in 2007. The significant positive effect of exchange rates is attributable to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar and the Euro during 2008. The gain is mainly due to the impact on the foreign currency future tax liabilities partially off-set by the impact on cash balances in Canadian dollars and Swedish krona, the currency in which the Company's Swedish subsidiaries pay tax. Income and Mining Taxes In 2008, the effective accounting income and mining tax expense rate was 23.8% compared to 12.5% in 2007 and 38.1% in 2006. This rate was significantly lower in 2007 compared to 2008 because of favourable changes in both federal and Quebec income tax laws enacted in December 2007. In particular, during the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recognized a $29.8 million reduction in federal deferred taxes resulting from the reduction of the federal tax rate to 15% effective for 2012 onward. The Company also recognized a $7.7 million reduction in Quebec deferred taxes from changes in regulations that now permit the deduction of Quebec mining duties for Quebec income tax purposes retroactive to January 1, 2007. The effective accounting income and mining tax expense rate of 23.8% in 2008 is lower than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the net effect of non-taxable foreign exchange gains, the non-taxable gain recognized on the Gold Eagle investment and the non-taxable investment writedowns. Liquidity and Capital Resources At the end of 2008, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash totalled $99.4 million compared to $396.0 million at the end of 2007. The decrease in cash resulted from investing activities which was partially offset by operating and financing activities. In 2008, cash used in investing activities increased to $917.5 million from $373.1 million in 2007. The investing activities in 2008 mainly consisted of project capital expenditures for the Meadowbank, Goldex, Kittila, LaRonde Mine extension, Lapa and Pinos Altos projects. Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased to $118.1 million in 2008 from $245.5 million in 2007 mainly due to the substantial decrease in byproduct revenues offset partly by increased 73 revenues from gold production. In 2008, cash provided from financing activities increased to $561.2 million from $127.3 million in 2007 due to net bank debt drawdowns of $200 million and the issuance of common shares and warrants to purchase common shares for aggregate net proceeds of $376.3 million. In 2008, the Company invested $908.9 million of cash in new projects and sustaining capital expenditures. Major expenditures in 2008 included $314.4 million at Meadowbank, $195.5 million at Kittila, $175.7 million at Pinos Altos, $88.9 million at Lapa, $36.6 million for the LaRonde Mine extension, $32.8 million at Goldex and $58.3 million for sustaining capital expenditures at the LaRonde Mine and Goldex Mine. The remaining capital expenditures to complete all of the Company's projects are expected to be funded by cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and drawdowns from the Company's bank credit facilities. A significant portion of the Company's cash and cash equivalents are denominated in US dollars. In 2008, the Company declared its 27th consecutive annual dividend. The dividend was $0.18 per share, consistent with the dividend paid in 2007. During the first quarter of 2008, the Company paid out its 2007 dividend amounting to $23.8 million. Although the Company expects to continue paying dividends, future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be subject to factors such as income, financial condition and capital requirements. In 2008, the Company issued common shares and warrants to purchase common shares, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of $376.3 million, in order to fund its construction projects and the acquisition of certain surface rights at the Pinos Altos mine project. In October 2008, the Company issued 779,250 flow-through common shares in a private placement for aggregate proceeds of $43.5 million. In December 2008, the Company issued 9.2 million units at a price of $31.50 per unit in a private placement for aggregate proceeds of $290 million, each unit consisting of a common share and one half of a common share purchase warrant exercisable at a price of $47.25 per share over the five-year term of the warrant. In connection with this transaction, the Company issued an additional four million additional warrants to a lead purchaser in consideration of its commitment to subscribe for a minimum number of units and to purchase units not allocated to other purchasers. Also in December 2008, the Company issued 900,000 common shares at $38.00 per share under a supplement to the Company's base shelf prospectus for aggregate proceeds of $34.2 million. During 2008, the Company made net drawdowns of $200 million from its bank credit facilities. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents during 2008 resulted in decreased cash balances of $8.1 million. This was mainly attributable to the weakening Canadian dollar as the Company holds Canadian dollar cash balances. The Company entered into a credit agreement on January 10, 2008 with a group of financial institutions providing for a $300 million unsecured revolving bank credit facility to replace its previous secured credit facility. This credit facility matures on January 10, 2013, but is extendible in certain circumstances. On September 4, 2008, the Company amended this credit facility (as so amended, the "First Credit Facility") and executed a second credit agreement (the "Second Credit Facility" and together with the First Credit Facility, the "Credit Facilities") with a separate group of financial institutions providing an additional $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility on substantially similar terms as the First Credit Facility, maturing on September 4, 2010. As of December 31, 2008, there was an aggregate of $200 million of principal outstanding on Credit Facilities; however, outstanding letters of credit issued as security for pension and environmental obligations decrease the amount available for future drawdowns under the Credit Facilities to $343 million. 74 Agnico-Eagle's contractual obligations as at December 31, 2008 are set out below: Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More than 5 Years (millions) Letter of credit obligations 3.7    3.7 Reclamation obligations(1) 118.5 2.0 2.0 2.0 112.5 Pension obligations(2) 3.2 0.1 0.2 0.8 2.1 Capital and operating leases 34.2 11.5 12.6 3.6 6.5 Credit Facilities repayment obligations(3) 200.0  125.0 75.0  Total(4) 359.6 13.6 139.8 81.4 124.8 Notes: (1)Mining operations are subject to environmental regulations which require companies to reclaim and remediate land disturbed by mining operations. The Company has submitted closure plans to the appropriate governmental agencies which estimate the nature, extent and costs of reclamation for each of its mining properties. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these reclamation obligations are presented here. These estimated costs are recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements on a discounted basis in accordance with FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("FAS 143"). See Note 5(a) to the audited consolidated financial statements. (2)The Company has Retirement Compensation Arrangement Plans (the "RCA Plans") with certain executives and a defined benefit pension plan for certain former employees. The RCA Plans provide pension benefits to the executives equal to 2% of the executive's final three-year average pensionable earnings for each year of service with the Company less the annual pension payable under the Company's basic defined contribution plan. Payments under the RCA Plans are secured by letter of credit from a Canadian chartered bank. The figures presented in this table have been actuarially determined. (3)For the purposes of the Company's obligations to repay amounts outstanding under its Credit Facilities, the Company has assumed that the indebtedness will be repaid at the current expiry date of the relevant Credit Facility. (4)The Company's estimated future positive cash flows are expected to be sufficient to satisfy the obligations set out above. 2009 Liquidity and Capital Resources Analysis The Company believes that it has sufficient capital resources to satisfy its 2009 mandatory expenditure commitments (including future obligations set out above) and discretionary expenditure commitments. The following table sets out expected future capital requirements and resources for 2009: Amount (millions) 2009 Mandatory Commitments: Contractual obligations (from table above) $ 14 Dividend payable (declared in 2008) 28 Total 2009 mandatory expenditure commitments $ 42 2009 Discretionary Commitments: Budgeted capital expenditures $ 454 Total 2009 mandatory and discretionary expenditure commitments $ 496 2009 Capital Resources: Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments (at December 31, 2008) $ 68 Estimated 2009 operating cash flow 154 Working capital (at December 31, 2008) (excluding cash, cash equivalents and short term investments) 110 Available under the Credit Facilities 343 Total 2009 Capital Resources $ 675 75 The Company believes its capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy all 2009 commitments (mandatory and discretionary). If extremely negative financial circumstances arise in the future, the Company may choose to decrease certain of its discretionary expenditure commitments, which includes its construction projects and future dividends. Outlook The following section contains "forward-looking statements" and "forward-looking information" within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Please see "Preliminary Note  Forward-Looking Information" for a discussion of assumptions and risks relating to such statements and information. Gold Production Growth LaRonde Mine Extension In 2009, payable gold production at the LaRonde Mine is expected to decline to approximately 203,000 ounces, as gold grades are scheduled to decline until 2012 when the deeper ore of the LaRonde extension is accessed. Total cash costs per ounce at the LaRonde Mine in 2009 are expected to be approximately $295 reflecting the assumption of significantly lower zinc prices going forward. Over the 2009 to 2018 period, total cash costs per ounce at the LaRonde Mine are expected to average $315, with average gold production of 320,000 ounces annually. Goldex Mine The Goldex Mine commenced production during the summer of 2008 and has attained the mill design rate of 6,900 tonnes of ore per day. The Goldex Mine is anticipated to produce approximately 160,000 ounces of gold in 2009 at estimated total cash costs per ounce of approximately $311. This compares favourably with the total cash costs per ounce incurred in 2008 as the mine was commissioning and ramping up to design rates during the year. Over the period of 2009 through 2017, total cash costs per ounce at Goldex are estimated to average approximately $270 with average gold production of approximately 160,000 ounces annually. The Company is examining the feasibility of increasing the production rate to 8,000 tonnes per day with results of the study expected in the second quarter of 2009. In addition, exploration activities will focus on resource to reserve conversion and mineralization to the west and at depth of the current resource envelope. Kittila Mine The Kittila Mine is now operating and commercial production is expected in the second quarter of 2009. The mine is anticipated to produce approximately 125,000 ounces of gold in 2009 at estimated total cash costs per ounce of approximately $333. The 2009 production forecast includes a contingency for an extended commissioning period of three months. Over the period of 2009 to 2018, total cash costs per ounce are estimated to be approximately $350 with anticipated average gold production of approximately 160,000 ounces annually. In light of the increase in gold reserves at the Kittila Mine in 2008, the Company is examining options to significantly increase the production rate at Kittila with results of the study expected in the fourth quarter of 2009. A $16 million exploration program will continue to focus on resource to reserve conversion, expanding resources below Suuri and Roura sections, and along strike. Lapa Mine Project The Lapa mine project is expected to begin production near mid-year 2009 and to produce an average of 115,000 ounces of gold per year through 2015 with average total cash costs per ounce of $315. Gold production during 2009 is expected to be approximately 55,000 ounces at estimated total cash costs per ounce of approximately $438. The 2009 production forecast includes a contingency for an extended commissioning period of three months. 76 Pinos Altos Mine Project The Pinos Altos mine project is scheduled to begin production in the third quarter of 2009. Construction is proceeding as planned with ore now being stockpiled from the Santo Nino open pit. Gold production in 2009 is expected to be approximately 42,000 ounces at estimated total cash costs per ounce of approximately $354. The 2009 production forecast includes a contingency for an extended commissioning period of three months. Over the period of 2009 to 2018, the mine is expected to produce an average of 165,000 ounces of gold per year. Total cash costs per ounce are estimated to average $245 over these years. An $11 million exploration program is planned for Pinos Altos in 2009 with a focus on resource to reserve conversion and expansion of the Pinos Altos and Creston Mascota zones. The objective of the program is to build upon the 1.0 million ounces of reserves added in 2008. The nearby Creston Mascota deposit has initial reserves of 0.4 million ounces of gold and 3.7 million ounces of silver. These reserves are part of the Pinos Altos deposit. A feasibility study is expected to be released in 2009 on a stand-alone heap leach operation that, if built, could potentially add to production at Pinos Altos. Creston Mascota is roughly 7 kilometres to the northwest of the main Santo Nino deposit at Pinos Altos. Meadowbank Mine Project Construction at the Meadowbank mine project will continue through 2009 with initial gold production anticipated in the first quarter of 2010. The mine is expected to produce an average of 335,000 ounces of gold per year from 2010 to 2018. Total cash costs per ounce are expected to average $370 over these years. The 2010 production forecast includes a contingency for an extended commissioning period of three months. A scoping study was initiated in 2008 to assess the feasibility of increasing of the proposed production rate from 8,500 tonnes per day to 10,000 tonnes per day. Results of the study are expected in the third quarter of 2009. In addition, an $11 million exploration program in 2009 will continue to focus on resource to reserve conversion and expansion of resources and reserves at the Vault, Goose South and Portage deposits. Growth Summary With the start of commercial production of the Goldex Mine in 2008 and the planned start of commercial production of Kittila, Lapa, and Pinos Altos in 2009, the Company believes it is delivering on its vision and growth strategy. Gold production is expected to double from 2008 levels to 590,000 ounces in 2009 and double again to 1.2 million ounces in 2010. Based on exploration results to date and planned exploration programs in 2009, the Company believes it is well positioned to potentially have several five million ounce gold deposits. The Company's goal is to increase gold reserves from its existing portfolio of mines and projects, reaching 20 million to 21 million ounces by year-end 2010. Further internal growth opportunities (on-going scoping studies and a feasibility study) are expected to add to production post-2010. In summary, the Company anticipates that the main contributors to the targeted increase in gold reserves, and increases to gold resources, are likely to be: Continued conversion of Agnico-Eagle's current gold resources to reserves Depth extension of the main Suuri and Roura zones at Kittila New gold zones to the north of the Kittila reserves Extension of the Goose South zone at depth and along strike at Meadowbank Extensions at depth at Santo Nino, Cerro Colorado and San Eligio zones at Pinos Altos New gold zones in the Creston Mascota area to the northwest of the Pinos Altos gold and silver reserve Financial Outlook Mining Revenue and Production Costs In 2009, the Company expects to continue to generate strong cash flow as production volumes are expected to remain relatively steady at the LaRonde Mine, the Goldex Mine ramps up to designed capacity, and the Kittila Mine commences commercial production. Metal prices will have a large impact on financial results, and although the Company cannot predict the prices that will be realized in 2009, gold prices in early 2009 (to March 14, 2009) have remained strong with the gold spot prices once again surpassing $1,000 per ounce in February 2009. 77 In addition, the Lapa mine project is expected to begin gold production near the end of the second quarter of 2009 and commissioning and first gold production at the Pinos Altos mine project is expected before the end of the third quarter 2009. The table below sets out actual production for 2008 and estimated production in 2009. 2009 Estimate 2008 Actual Gold (ounces) 590,300 276,762 Silver (000's ounces) 4,624 4,079 Zinc (tonnes) 67,503 65,755 Copper (tonnes) 6,632 6,922 For 2009, the Company is expecting total cash costs per ounce at the LaRonde Mine to be $295 compared to $106 in 2008. Net silver, zinc and copper revenue is treated as a reduction of production costs in arriving at estimates of total cash costs per ounce, and therefore production and price assumptions for these metals play an important role in these estimates for the LaRonde Mine due to its large byproduct production. An increase in byproduct metal prices above forecast levels would result in improved cash costs for the LaRonde Mine. In addition, the Pinos Altos mine project contains significant byproduct silver. Total cash costs per ounce at the Goldex Mine, Kittila Mine, and the Pinos Altos mine project in 2009 are expected to be $311, $333, and $354 respectively. As production costs at the LaRonde Mine, Goldex Mine, and Lapa mine project are or will be denominated mostly in Canadian dollars, the production costs at Kittila Mine are denominated mostly in Euros and the production costs at the Pinos Altos mine project will be mostly denominated in Mexican pesos, the Canadian dollar/US dollar, Euro/US dollar and Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rates also affect the estimates. The foreign exchange rates have been trending favourably for the Company as the US dollar has appreciated relative to these currencies since late 2008. The table below sets out the metal price assumptions and exchange rate assumptions used in deriving the estimated total cash costs per ounce for 2009 (production estimates for each metal are shown in the table above) as well as the market average closing prices for each variable for the first two months of 2009. Cash Cost Assumptions Market Average Silver (per ounce) $ 10.00 $ 12.35 Zinc (per tonne) $ 1,200 $ 1,149 Copper (per tonne) $ 3,700 $ 3,267 C$/US$ exchange rate $ 1.2200 $ 1.2355 Euro/US$ exchange rate $ 0.7813 $ 0.7641 The estimated sensitivity of the Company's 2009 estimated total cash costs per ounce and 2009 estimated operating costs to a 10% change in the metal price and exchange rate assumptions above follows: Change in variable Impact on total cash costs ($/oz.) C$/US$ $ 35 Euro/US$ $ 7 Zinc $ 14 Silver $ 8 Copper $ 4 Note: The sensitivities presented are based on production and price assumptions set out above. Operating costs are not affected by fluctuations in byproduct metal prices. The Company may use derivative strategies to limit the downside risk associated with fluctuating byproduct metal prices and enters into forward contracts to lock in exchange rates based on projected Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican peso operating and capital needs.

Please see " Results of Operations  Production Costs" for a discussion about the use of the non-US GAAP financial measure total cash costs per ounce. 78 Exploration Expense In 2009, Agnico-Eagle expects expenditures of $32 million on grassroots exploration and corporate development comprised mostly of grassroots exploration in Canada, Mexico, Finland and the United States outside of the Company's currently contemplated mining areas. Exploration is success driven and thus these estimates could change materially based on the success of the various exploration programs. Other Expenses Cash general and administrative expenses are not expected to increase materially in 2008, however non-cash variances may occur as a result of variances in the Black-Scholes pricing of any stock options granted by the Company in 2009. In 2009, provincial capital taxes are expected to be marginally higher while amortization is expected to be approximately $90 million due to a higher capital base at the LaRonde Mine, the first full year amortization of the Goldex Mine and additional amortization relating to the Kittila Mine and the Pinos Altos mine project as they come into commercial production. Interest expense in 2009 is expected to be relatively consistent with 2008. If the Company draws down its aggregate $600 million Credit Facilities to further fund capital expenditures in 2009, the incremental interest expense will be capitalized. The Company's effective tax rate is expected to be 37% in 2009 compared to an effective rate of 23.8% realized in 2008. The lower effective rate in 2008 was due to the factors mentioned in " Results of Operations  Income and Mining Taxes" above. Capital Expenditures Agnico-Eagle's gold growth program remains well funded, in spite of a sharp downturn in the prices of byproducts metals. Capital expenditures including all costs for construction and development, sustaining capital, and capitalized exploration costs, are expected to total approximately $454 million in 2009. During 2009, the Company expects to generate internal cash flow from the sale of approximately 590,000 ounces of gold and the associated byproduct metals. The breakdown of the 2009 capital expenditures program is as follows: $40 million in capital expenditures related to construction and development at the LaRonde Mine extension $17 million in capital expenditures related to construction and development at the Lapa mine project; $125 million in capital expenditures related to construction and development at the Pinos Altos mine project; $155 million in capital expenditures related to construction and development at the Meadowbank mine project; $95 million in sustaining capital expenditures related to the various mine sites that are or will be in operation during 2009; and $22 million in capitalized exploration expenditures The Company continues to examine other possible corporate development opportunities which may result in the acquisition of companies or assets with securities, cash or a combination thereof. If cash is used, depending on the size of the acquisition, Agnico-Eagle may be required to borrow money or issue securities to fund such cash requirements. Outstanding Securities The following table sets out the maximum number of common shares that would be outstanding if all dilutive instruments outstanding at March 25, 2009 were exercised: Common shares outstanding at March 25, 2009 155,078,868 Employee stock options 6,733,490 Warrants 8,600,000 170,412,358 79 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company evaluates the estimates periodically, including those relating to trade receivables, inventories, future tax assets and liabilities, mining properties and asset retirement obligations. In making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities, the Company uses estimates based on historical experience and various assumptions that are considered reasonable in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies relate to its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board and the Audit Committee has reviewed the Company's disclosure in this Operating and Financial Review and Prospects. Mining Properties, Plant and Equipment and Mine Development Costs Significant payments related to the acquisition of land and mineral rights are capitalized as mining properties at cost. If a mineable ore body is discovered, such costs are amortized to income when production begins, using the unit-of-production method, based on estimated proven and probable reserves. If no mineable ore body is discovered, such costs are expensed in the period in which it is determined the property has no future economic value. Expenditures for new facilities and improvements that can extend the useful lives of existing facilities are capitalized as plant and equipment at cost. Interest costs incurred for the construction of projects are capitalized. Mine development costs incurred after the commencement of production are capitalized or deferred to the extent that these costs benefit the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access single ore blocks are expensed as incurred; otherwise, such vertical and horizontal development is classified as mine development costs. Agnico-Eagle records depreciation on both plant and equipment and mine development costs used in commercial production on a unit-of-production basis based on the estimated proven and probable ore reserves of the mine. The unit-of-production method defines the denominator as the total proven and probable tonnes of reserves. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to income as production costs. Assets under construction are not depreciated until the end of the construction period. Upon commencement of commercial production, the capitalized construction costs are transferred to the various categories of plant and equipment. Mineral exploration costs are charged to income in the year in which they are incurred. When it is determined that a mining property can be economically developed as a result of established proven and probable reserves, the costs of further exploration and development to further delineate the ore body on such property are capitalized. The establishment of proven and probable reserves is based on results of final feasibility studies, which indicate whether a property is economically feasible. Upon commencement of the commercial production of a development project, these costs are transferred to the appropriate asset category and are amortized to income using the unit-of-production method mentioned above. Mine development costs, net of salvage values, relating to a property which is abandoned or considered uneconomic for the foreseeable future are written off. The carrying values of mining properties, plant and equipment and mine development costs are reviewed periodically, when impairment factors exist, for possible impairment, based on the future undiscounted net cash flows of the operating mine or development property. If it is determined that the estimated net recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, then a write down to the estimated fair value amount is made with a charge to income. Estimated future cash flows of an operating mine and development properties include estimates of recoverable ounces of gold based on the proven and probable reserves. To the extent economic value exists beyond the proven and probable reserves of an operating mine or development property, this value 80 is included as part of the estimated future cash flows. Estimated future cash flows also involve estimates regarding metal prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production levels, capital and reclamation costs, and related income and mining taxes, all based on detailed engineering life-of-mine plans. Cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties and changes in the estimates of the cash flows may affect the recoverability of long-lived assets. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when the following conditions are met: (a)persuasive evidence of an arrangement to purchase exists; (b)the price is determinable; (c)the product has been delivered; and (d)collection of the sales price is reasonably assured. Revenue from gold and silver in the form of dore bars is recorded when the refined gold and silver is sold and delivered to the customer. Generally all the gold and silver in the form of dore bars recovered in the Company's milling process is sold in the period in which it is produced. Under the terms of concentrate sales contracts with third-party smelters, final prices for the gold, silver, zinc, copper and lead in the concentrate are set based on the prevailing spot market metal prices on a specified future date based on the date that the concentrate is delivered to the smelter. Agnico-Eagle records revenues under these contracts based on forward prices at the time of delivery, which is when transfer of legal title to concentrate passes to the third-party smelters. The terms of the contracts result in differences between the recorded estimated price at delivery and the final settlement price. These differences are adjusted through revenue at each subsequent financial statement date. Revenues from mining operations consist of gold revenues, net of smelting, refining and other marketing charges. Revenues from byproduct sales are shown net of smelter charges as part of revenues from mining operations. Reclamation Costs On an annual basis, the Company assesses cost estimates and other assumptions used in the valuation of Asset Retirement Obligations ("ARO") at each of its mineral properties to reflect events, changes in circumstances and new information available. Changes in these cost estimates and assumptions have a corresponding impact on the fair value of the ARO. For closed mines, any change in the fair value of AROs results in a corresponding charge or credit within other expense, whereas at operating mines the charge is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the corresponding asset. In 2008, the Company recorded adjustments of $13.6 million for changes in estimates of the AROs at our operating mines. AROs arise from the acquisition, development, construction and normal operation of mining property, plant and equipment, due to government controls and regulations that protect the environment on the closure and reclamation of mining properties. The major parts of the carrying amount of AROs relate to tailings and heap leach pad closure/ rehabilitation; demolition of buildings/mine facilities; ongoing water treatment; and ongoing care and maintenance of closed mines. The fair values of AROs are measured by discounting the expected cash flows using a discount factor that reflects the credit-adjusted risk-free rate of interest. The Company prepares estimates of the timing and amount of expected cash flows when an ARO is incurred. Expected cash flows are updated to reflect changes in facts and circumstances. The principal factors that can cause expected cash flows to change are: the construction of new processing facilities; changes in the quantities of material in reserves and a corresponding change in the life of mine plan; changing ore characteristics that impact required environmental protection measures and related costs; changes in water quality that impact the extent of water treatment required; and changes in laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. When expected cash flows increase, the revised cash flows are discounted using a current discount factor whereas when expected cash 81 flows decrease the reduced cash flows are discounted using the historical discount factor used in the original estimation of the expected cash flows, and then in both cases any change in the fair value of the ARO is recorded. Agnico-Eagle records the fair value of an ARO when it is incurred. AROs are adjusted to reflect the passage of time (accretion) calculated by applying the discount factor implicit in the initial fair value measurement to the beginning-of-period carrying amount of the AROs. For producing mines, accretion expense is recorded in the cost of goods sold each period. Upon settlement of an ARO, Agnico-Eagle records a gain or loss if the actual cost differs from the carrying amount of the ARO. Settlement gains/losses are recorded in other (income) expense. Other environmental remediation costs that are not AROs as defined by FAS 143 are expensed as incurred. Future Tax Assets and Liabilities Agnico-Eagle follows the liability method of tax allocation for accounting for income taxes. Under this method of tax allocation, future income and mining tax bases of assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 requires the recognition of the effect of uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not based on technical merits that the position would be sustained. The Company recognizes the amount of the tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. It further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in the year of such change. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense in the current year. The impact of the adoption of FIN 48 was to increase the Company's future income tax liability by $4.5 million. On November 10, 2008, the Canadian Department of Finance released draft legislation amending section 261 of the Income Tax Act (Canada), which provides new tax calculating currency rules that taxpayers must use when determining their Canadian tax results. These new currency rules allow the Company to prepare its corporate tax return using US dollars instead of translating the annual activity into Canadian dollars. As of December 31, 2008, the draft legislation has not been finalized; however, the Company expects this legislation to be effective for its 2008 tax returns. Management is currently assessing the impact of this legislation on the Company. Financial Instruments Agnico-Eagle uses derivative financial instruments, primarily option and forward contracts, to manage exposure to fluctuations of metal prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Agnico-Eagle does not hold financial instruments or derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized periodically in income or in shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), depending on the nature of the derivative financial instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. Financial instruments designated as hedges are tested for effectiveness on a quarterly basis. Gains and losses on those contracts that are proven to be effective are reported as a component of the related transaction. Stock-Based Compensation In 2003, the Company prospectively adopted FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" as amended by FASB Statement No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure". These accounting standards recommend the expensing of stock option grants after January 1, 2003. The standards recommend that the fair value of stock options be recognized in income over the applicable vesting period as a compensation expense. 82 The Company's Employee Stock Option Plan provides for the granting of options to directors, officers, employees and service providers to purchase common shares. Share options have exercise prices equal to market price at the grant date or over the term of the applicable vesting period depending on the terms of the option agreements. The fair value of these stock options is recognized in the consolidated statement of income or in the consolidated balance sheet if capitalized as part of property, plant and mine development over the applicable vesting period as a compensation cost. Any consideration paid by employees on exercise of stock options or purchase of stock is credited to share capital. Fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which requires the Company to estimate the expected volatility of the Company's share price and the expected life of the stock options. Limitations with existing option valuation models and the inherent difficulties associated with estimating these variables create difficulties in determining a reliable single measure of the fair value of stock option grants. The dilutive impact of stock option grants is factored into the Company's reported diluted income (loss) per share. Pensions As of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" ("FAS 158"). FAS 158 required employers that sponsor one or more defined benefit plans to (i) recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in its statement of financial position, (ii) recognize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, (iii) measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer's fiscal year-end statement of financial position, and (iv) disclose in the notes to the financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The impact of adopting FAS 158 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows: Before Application of FAS 158 Adjustment After Application of FAS 158 Reclamation provision and other liabilities $ 26,051 $ 1,406 $ 27,457 Deferred income tax liability $ 170,087 $ (396 ) $ 169,691 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (16,989 ) $ (1,010 ) $ (17,999 ) Total shareholders' equity $ 1,253,415 $ (1,010 ) $ 1,252,405 Commercial Production The Company assesses each mine construction project to determine when a mine moves into production stage. The criteria used to assess the start date are determined based on the nature of each mine construction project, such as the complexity of a plant and its location. The Company considers various relevant criteria to assess when the mine is substantially complete and ready for its intended use and moved into production stage. The criteria considered include: (1) completion of a reasonable period of testing of mine plant and equipment; (2) ability to produce minerals in saleable form (within specifications); and (3) ability to sustain ongoing production of minerals. When a mine construction project moves into the production stage, the capitalization of certain mine construction costs ceases and costs are either capitalized to inventory or expensed, except for sustaining capital costs related to property, plant and equipment and underground mine development or reserve development. Stripping Costs Pre-production stripping costs are capitalized until an "other than de minimis" level of mineral is produced, after which time such costs are either capitalized to inventory or expensed. The Company considers various relevant criteria to assess when an "other than de minimis" level of mineral is produced. The criteria considered include: (1) the number of ounces mined compared to total ounces in reserves; (2) the quantity of ore mined compared to the total quantity of ore expected to be mined over the life of the mine; (3) the current stripping 83 ratio compared to the expected stripping ratio over the life of the mine; and (4) the ore grade compared to the expected ore grade over the life of the mine. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Developments Under the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 74, the Company is required to disclose information related to new accounting standards that have not yet been adopted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of these statements will have on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures. In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160, "Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements" ("FAS 160"). FAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for entities that have equity investments that are not attributable directly to the parent, called non-controlling interests or minority interests. Specifically, FAS 160 states where and how to report non-controlling interests in the consolidated statements of financial position and operations, how to account for changes in non-controlling interests and provides disclosure requirements. The provisions of FAS 160 are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" ("FAS 141(R)"). FAS 141(R) establishes how an entity accounts for the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests acquired, how to account for goodwill acquired and determines what disclosures are required as part of a business combination. FAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, early adoption is prohibited. In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS 161"). This statement requires entities to provide greater transparency about: (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS 133"), and its related interpretations, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim period beginning after November, 15 2008. Comparative disclosures for earlier periods are not required. In 2008, the Emerging Issues Task Force (the "EITF") reached consensus on Issue No. 08-3, "Accounting by Lessees for Maintenance Deposits under Lease Agreements" ("EITF 08-3"). EITF 08-3 requires that maintenance deposits should be considered a deposit when paid to the lessor if it is probable (as defined in FASB Concept Statement No. 6) that the deposits will be refunded to the lessee. The cost of maintenance activities should be expensed or capitalized by the lessee, as appropriate, when the underlying maintenance is performed. If it is determined that a maintenance deposit is unlikely to be refunded to the lessee, the deposit is recognized as additional rent expense. If it is probable at inception of the lease that a portion of the deposits will not be refunded, the lessee should recognize as expense a pro rata portion of the deposits as they are paid. The issue is effective for fiscal years beginning after December, 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is not permitted. In May 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. APB 14-1, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)" ("FSP APB 14-1"). FSP APB 14-1 applies to convertible debt instruments that, by their stated terms, may be settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion, including partial cash settlement, unless the embedded conversion option is required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under FAS 133. Convertible debt instruments within the scope of FSP APB 14-1 are not addressed by the existing APB 14. FSP APB 14-1 requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments within the scope of FSP APB 14-1 be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the entity's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. This requires an allocation of the convertible debt proceeds between the liability component and the embedded conversion option (i.e., the equity component). The difference between the principal amount of the debt and the amount of the proceeds allocated to the liability component will be reported as a debt discount and subsequently amortized to earnings over the 84 instrument's expected life using the effective interest method. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. In June 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 07-5, "Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity's Own Stock" ("EITF 07-5"). EITF 07-5 clarifies the determination of whether an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an entity's own stock, which would qualify as a scope exception under FAS 133. EITF 07-5 is effective for the Company's fiscal years beginning January 1, 2009. Early adoption for an existing instrument is not permitted. In November 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 08-6, "Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations" ("EITF 08-6"), in which the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations involving equity method investments were clarified. The intent of EITF 08-6 is to provide guidance on (i) determining the initial carrying value of an equity method investment, (ii) performing an impairment assessment of an underlying indefinite-lived intangible asset of an equity method investment, (iii) accounting for an equity method investee's issuance of shares, and (iv) accounting for a change in an investment from the equity method to the cost method. EITF 08-6 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and is to be applied prospectively. In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 132(R)-1, "Employers' Disclosures about Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assets" ("FSP FAS 132(R)-1"), which amends FASB Statement No. 132 "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits", to provide guidance on an employer's disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The objective of FSP FAS 132(R)-1 is to require more detailed disclosures about employers' plan assets, including employers' investment strategies, major categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. FSP FAS 132(R)-1 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. Upon initial application, the provisions of this FSP are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes. Based on recent announcements from the Canadian Securities Administrators (the "CSA") and the SEC, it is currently anticipated that as a Canadian issuer and existing US GAAP filer, the earliest date at which the Company will be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as its principal basis of accounting is for the year ending December 31, 2014. Therefore, financial statement comparative figures prepared under IFRS would be required for fiscal year 2013. The Company has initiated the work with transition to IFRS. A project organization with a project group and a steering committee has been established and a high level project plan has been formulated. The implementation of IFRS will be done through three distinct phases: (i) diagnostics, (ii) detailed IFRS analysis and conversion, and (iii) implement IFRS in daily business. Phase (i) has been completed and the start of phase (ii) will be decided in mid-2009. As a result of phase (i), a diagnostics report has been finalized with the primary objective to understand, identify and assess the overall effort required by the Company to produce financial information in accordance with the IFRS. The key areas for the diagnostics work was to review the 2007 consolidated financial statements of the Company and get a detailed understanding of the differences between IFRS and US GAAP to be able to identify potential system and process changes required as a result of converting to IFRS.

The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model is a commonly used pricing model that assumes the valued option can only be exercised at expiration. Key assumptions used were: (i) the exercise price which is the closing price for the common shares of the Company on the TSX on the day prior to the date of grant, which was C$54.42; (ii) the risk free interest rate, which was 3.70%; (iii) current time to expiration of the option which was assumed to be 2.5 years; (iv) the volatility for the common shares of the Company on the TSX, which was 44.37%; and (iv) the dividend yield for the common shares of the Company, which was 0.22%. (2)Consists of 53%, 50%, 54%, 53% and 47% of the maximum permissible bonus calculated on the base salaries of Messrs. Boyd, Scherkus, Garofalo, Blackburn and Laing, respectively. (3)Consists of premiums paid for term life insurance, automobile allowances and education and fitness benefits for the Named Executive Officers. (4)The total compensation was paid in Canadian dollars. The Company reports its financial statements in United States dollars. On December 31, 2008 the Noon Buying Rate was C$1.00 equals US$0.8166. Stock Option Plan Under the Company's Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (the "Stock Option Plan"), options to purchase common shares may be granted to directors, officers, employees and service providers of the Company. The exercise price of options granted may not be less than the closing market price for the common shares of the Company on the TSX on the day prior to the date of grant. The maximum term of options granted under the Stock Option Plan is five years and the maximum number of stock options that can be issued in any year is 2% of 94 the Company's outstanding common shares. In addition, a maximum of 25% of the options granted in an option grant vest upon the date they are granted with the remaining options vesting equally over the next three anniversaries of the option grant. The Stock Option Plan provides for the termination of an option held by an option holder in the following circumstances: the option expires (no later than five years after the option was granted); 30 days after the option holder ceases to be an employee, officer, director of or consultant to the Company or any subsidiary of the Company; six months after the death of the option holder; and where such option holder is a director, four years after the date he or she resigns or retires from the Board (provided that in no event will any option expire later than five years after the option was granted). An option granted under the Stock Option Plan may only be assigned to eligible assignees, including a spouse, a minor child, a minor grandchild, a trust governed by a registered retirement savings plan of an eligible participant, a corporation controlled by such participant or a family trust of which the eligible participant is a trustee and of which all beneficiaries are eligible assignees. Assignments must be approved by the Board and any stock exchange or other authority. The Board may amend or revise the terms of the Stock Option Plan as permitted by law and subject to any required approval by any stock exchange or other authority. No amendment or revision to the Stock Option Plan which adversely affects the rights of any option holder under any option granted under the Stock Option Plan can be made without the consent of the option holder whose rights are being affected. In addition, no amendments to the Stock Option Plan to increase the number of common shares reserved for issuance, to change the designation of who is an eligible participant, to extend the term of an option held by an insider, to increase any limit on grants of options to insiders of the Company or to decrease the prices at which options can be exercised can be made without first obtaining the approval of the Company's shareholders. In response to a TSX staff notice regarding amendments to security based compensation arrangements, the Stock Option Plan was amended in 2007 such that where the Company has imposed trading restrictions on directors and officers that fall within ten trading days of the expiry of an option, such option's expiry date shall be the tenth day following the termination of such restrictions. The Stock Option Plan does not expressly entitle participants to convert a stock option into a stock appreciation right. Under the Stock Option Plan, only eligible persons who are not directors or officers of the Company are entitled to receive loans, guarantees or other support arrangements from the Company to facilitate option exercises. During 2008, no loans, guarantees or other financial assistance was provided under the plan. The number of common shares reserved for issuance under the Stock Option Plan is 10,266,075 common shares (comprised of 6,523,640 common shares relating to options issued but unexercised and 3,742,435 common shares relating to options available to be issued), being 6.6% of the Company's 155,402,618 common shares outstanding as at March 25, 2009.

Full-time employees who have been continuously employed by Agnico-Eagle or its subsidiaries for at least twelve months are eligible at the beginning of each fiscal year to elect to participate in the Employee Share Purchase Plan. Eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their basic annual salary through monthly payroll deductions or quarterly payments by cheque. Directors may contribute up to 100% of their annual Board and Committee retainer fees. Agnico-Eagle contributes an amount equal to 50% of the individual's contributions and issues shares which have a market value equal to the total contributions (individual and Company) under the Employee Share Purchase Plan. In 2008, the shareholders of 96 Agnico-Eagle approved an amendment to the Employee Share Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares available under such plan to 5,000,000 shares. Of the 5,000,000 shares approved in 2008 under the Employee Share Purchase Plan, Agnico-Eagle has, as of March 25, 2009, reserved 2,937,153 common shares for issuance under the plan.

There are no pension benefit limits under the RCA Plans. The RCA Plans provide an annual pension at age 60 equal to 2% of the executive's final three-year average pensionable earnings for each year of continuous service with the Company, less the annual pension payable under the Company's Basic Plan. The pensionable earnings for the purposes of the RCA Plans consist of all basic remuneration and do not include benefits, bonuses, automobile or other allowances, or unusual payments. Payments under the RCA Plans are secured by a letter of credit from a Canadian chartered bank. Mr. Boyd and Mr. Scherkus may retire early, any time after reaching age 55, with a benefit based on service and final average earnings at the date of retirement, with no early retirement reduction. The Company does not have a policy to grant extra years of service under its pension plans. The following table sets forth summary information about the Basic Plan and Company's supplemental defined contribution plan (the "Supplemental Plan") for each of the Named Executive Officers as at December 31, 2008.

Gregory Laing 18,533 65,900 nil 79,204 The Basic Plan provides pension benefits to employees of Agnico-Eagle generally, including the Named Executive Officers. Under the Basic Plan, the Company contributes 5% of each employee's base employment compensation to the Basic Plan. The Company's contributions, together with the participant's contributions, cannot exceed the money purchase limit, as defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada). Upon termination, the Company's contribution to the Basic Plan ceases and the participant is entitled to a pension benefit in the amount of the vested account balance. All contributions to the Basic Plan are invested in a variety of funds offered by the plan administrator, at the direction of the participant. 97 In addition to the Basic Plan, effective January 1, 2008, in line with the Company's compensation policy that compensation must be competitive in order to help attract and retain the executives needed to lead and grow the Company's business and to address the weakness of the Company's retirement benefits when compared to its peers in the gold production industry, the Company adopted the Supplemental Plan for designated executives at the level of Vice-President or above. On December 31 of each year, the Company credits each designated executive's account an amount equal to 15% of the designated executive's earnings for the year (including salary and short term bonus), less the Company's contribution to the Basic Plan. In addition, on December 31 of each year, the Company will credit each designated executive's account a notional investment return equal to the balance of such designated executive's account at the beginning of the year multiplied by the yield rate for Government of Canada marketable bonds with average yields over ten years. Upon retirement after attaining the minimum age of 55, the designated executive's account will be paid out in either (a) five annual installments subsequent to the date of retirement, or (b) by way of lump sum payment, at the executive's option. If the designated executive's employment is terminated prior to reaching the age of 55, such designated executive will receive, by way of lump sum payment, the total amount credited to his or her account. Employment Contracts/Termination Arrangements Agnico-Eagle has employment agreements with all executive officers which provide for an annual base salary, bonus and certain pension, health, dental and other insurance and automobile benefits. These amounts may be increased at the discretion of the Board upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. For the current base salary for each Named Executive Officer see "Summary Compensation Table" above. If the individual agreements are terminated other than for cause, death or disability, or upon their resignation following certain events, all of the Named Executive Officers would be entitled to a payment equal to two and one-half times the annual base salary at the date of termination plus an amount equal to two and one-half times the annual bonus (averaged over the preceding two years but not including stock options) and a continuation of benefits for up to two and one-half years or until the individual commences new employment. Certain events that would trigger a severance payment are: termination of employment without cause; a substantial alteration of responsibilities; a reduction of base salary or benefits; an office relocation of greater than 100 kilometres; a failure to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor to assume the individual's employment agreement or provide the individual with a comparable position, duties, salary and benefits; or any change in control of the Company. If a severance payment triggering event had occurred on December 31, 2008, the severance payments that would be payable to each of the Named Executive Officers would be approximately as follows: Mr. Boyd  C$4,783,750; Mr. Scherkus  C$2,958,750; Mr. Garofalo  C$1,585;000; Mr. Blackburn  C$1,308,750; and Mr. Laing  C$1,288,750.

Davis, John Merfyn Roberts and David Garofalo were appointed to the Board on June 17, 2008. Indebtedness of Directors, Executive Officers and Senior Officers There is no outstanding indebtedness to Agnico-Eagle by any of its officers or directors. Agnico-Eagle does not make loans to directors and officers under any circumstances. Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance The Company has purchased, at its expense, directors' and officers' liability insurance policies to provide insurance against possible liabilities incurred by them in their capacity as directors and officers of the Company. The premium for these policies for the period from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 is C$992,329. The policies provide coverage of up to C$100 million per occurrence to a maximum of $100 million per annum. There is no deductible for directors and officers and a C$250,000 deductible for each claim made by the Company (C$1 million deductible for securities claims). The insurance applies in circumstances where the Company may not indemnify its directors and officers for their acts or omissions. Board Practices The Board and management have been following the developments in corporate governance requirements and best practices standards in both Canada and the United States. As these requirements and practices have evolved, the Company has responded in a positive and proactive way by assessing its practices against these requirements and modifying, or targeting for modification, practices to bring them into compliance with these corporate governance requirements and best practices standards. The Company revises, from time to time, the Board mandate and the charters for the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Governance Committee and the Health, Safety and Environment Committee to reflect the new and evolving corporate governance requirements and best practices standards in Canada and the United States. The Board believes that effective corporate governance contributes to improved corporate performance and enhanced shareholder value. The Company's governance practices reflect the Board's assessment of the governance structure and process which can best serve to realize these objectives in the Company's particular circumstance. The Company's governance practices are subject to review and evaluation through the Board's Corporate Governance Committee to ensure that, as the Company's business evolves, changes in structure and process necessary to ensure continued good governance are identified and implemented. 102 The Company is required under the rules of the CSA to disclose its corporate governance practices and provide a description of the Company's system of corporate governance. This Statement of Corporate Governance Practices has been prepared by the Board's Corporate Governance Committee and approved by the Board. Additional information on each director standing for election, including other public company boards on which they serve and their attendance record for all Board and Committee meetings during 2008, can be found under " Directors and Senior Management" and " Compensation of Directors and Other Information". Director Independence The Board consists of twelve directors. The Board has made an affirmative determination that nine of its twelve current members are "independent" within the meaning of the CSA rules and the standards of the NYSE. With the exception of Messrs. Boyd, Scherkus and Garofalo, all directors are independent of management and free from any interest and any business which could materially interfere with their ability to act as a director with a view to the best interests of the Company. In reaching this determination, the Board considered the circumstances and relationships with the Company and its affiliates of each of its directors. In determining that all directors except Messrs. Boyd, Scherkus and Garofalo are independent, the Board took into consideration the fact that none of the remaining directors are an officer or employee of the Company or any of its affiliates or party to any material contract with the Company and that none receives remuneration from the Company and its affiliates in excess of directors' fees and stock option grants. Messrs. Boyd, Scherkus and Garofalo are considered related because they are officers of the Company. All directors, other than Messrs. Boyd, Scherkus and Garofalo, also meet the independence standard as set out in SOX. The Board regularly meets independently of management at the request of any director or may excuse members of management from all or a portion of any meeting where a potential conflict of interest arises or where otherwise appropriate. The Board is scheduled to meet without management before or after each Board meeting. In addition, after each Board meeting held to consider interim and annual financial statements, the Board meets without management. In 2008, the Board met without management at each Board meeting, being ten separate occasions, including the four scheduled quarterly meetings. To promote the exercise of independent judgment by directors in considering transactions and agreements, any director or officer who has a material interest in the matter being considered would not be present for discussions relating to the matter and would not participate in any vote on the matter. Chairman Mr. Nasso is the Chairman of the Board and Mr. Boyd is the Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Nasso is not a member of management. The Board believes that the separation of the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer enhances the ability of the Board to function independently of management and does not foresee that the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will be held by the same person. The Board has adopted a position description for the Chairman of the Board. The Chairman's role is to provide leadership to directors in discharging their duties and obligations as set out in the mandate of the Board. The specific responsibilities of the Chairman include providing advice, counsel and mentorship to the Chief Executive Officer, appointing the Chair of each of the Board Committees and promoting the delivery of information to the members of the Board on a timely basis to keep them fully apprised of all matters which are material to them at all times. The Chairman's responsibilities also include scheduling, overseeing and presiding over meetings of the Board and presiding over meetings of the Company's shareholders. Board Mandate The Board's mandate is to provide stewardship of the Company, to oversee the management of the Company's business and affairs, to maintain its strength and integrity, to oversee the Company's strategic direction, its organization structure and succession planning of senior management and to perform any other duties required by law. The Board's strategic planning process consists of an annual review of the Company's 103 three-year business plan and, from time to time (at least annually), a meeting focused on strategic planning matters. As part of this process, the Board reviews and approves the corporate objectives proposed by the Chief Executive Officer and advises management in the development of a corporate strategy to achieve those objectives. The Board also reviews the principal risks inherent in the Company's business, including environmental, industrial and financial risks, and assesses the systems to manage these risks. The Board also monitors the performance of senior management against the business plan through a periodic review process (at least every quarter) and reviews and approves promotion and succession matters. The Board holds management responsible for the development of long-term strategies for the Company. The role of the Board is to review, question, validate and ultimately approve the strategies and policies proposed by management. The Board relies on management to perform the data gathering, analysis and reporting functions which are critical to the Board for effective corporate governance. In addition, the Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the President and Chief Operating Officer, the Senior Vice-President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, the Senior Vice-President, Corporate Development, the Senior Vice-President, Exploration and the Senior Vice-President, Metallurgy and Marketing report to the Board at least every quarter on the Company's progress in the preceding quarter and on the strategic, operational and financial issues facing the Company. Management is authorized to act, without Board approval, on all ordinary course matters relating to the Company's business. Management seeks the Board's prior approval for significant changes in the Company's affairs such as major capital expenditures, financing arrangements and significant acquisitions and divestitures. Board approval is required for any venture outside of the Company's existing businesses and for any change in senior management. Recommendations of committees of the Board require the approval of the full Board before being implemented. In addition, the Board oversees and reviews significant corporate plans and initiatives, including the annual three-year business plan and budget and significant matters of corporate strategy or policy. The Company's authorization policy and risk management policy ensure compliance with good corporate governance practices. Both policies formalize controls over the management or other employees of the Company by stipulating internal approval processes for transactions, investments, commitments and expenditures and, in the case of the risk management policy, establishing objectives and guidelines for metal price hedging, foreign exchange and short-term investment risk management and insurance. The Board, directly and through its Audit Committee, also assesses the integrity of the Company's internal control and management information systems. The Board oversees the Company's approach to communications with shareholders and other stakeholders and approves specific communications initiatives from time to time. The Company conducts an active investor relations program. The program involves responding to shareholder inquiries, briefing analysts and fund managers with respect to reported financial results and other announcements by the Company and meeting with individual investors and other stakeholders. Senior management reports regularly to the Board on these matters. The Board reviews and approves the Company's major communications with shareholders and the public, including quarterly and annual financial results, the annual report and the management information circular. The Board has a Disclosure Policy which establishes standards and procedures relating to contacts with analysts and investors, news releases, conference calls, disclosure of material information, trading restrictions and blackout periods. The Board's mandate is posted on the Company's website at www.agnico-eagle.com. Position Descriptions Chief Executive Officer The Board has adopted a position description for the Chief Executive Officer who has full responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the Company's business in accordance with the Company's strategic plan and current year operating and capital expenditure budgets as approved by the Board. In discharging his responsibility for the day-to-day operation of Agnico-Eagle's business, subject to the oversight by the Board, the Chief Executive Officer's specific responsibilities include: providing leadership and direction to the other members of Agnico-Eagle's senior management team; 104 fostering a corporate culture that promotes ethical practices and encourages individual integrity; maintaining a positive and ethical work climate that is conducive to attracting, retaining and motivating top-quality employees at all levels; working with the Chairman in determining the matters and materials that should be presented to the Board; together with the Chairman, developing and recommending to the Board a long-term strategy and vision for Agnico-Eagle that leads to enhancement of shareholder value; developing and recommending to the Board annual business plans and budgets that support Agnico-Eagle's long-term strategy; ensuring that the day-to-day business affairs of Agnico-Eagle are appropriately managed; consistently striving to achieve Agnico-Eagle's financial and operating goals and objectives; designing or supervising the design and implementation of effective disclosure and internal controls; maintaining responsibility for the integrity of the financial reporting process; seeking to secure for Agnico-Eagle a satisfactory competitive position within its industry; ensuring that Agnico-Eagle has an effective management team below the level of the Chief Executive Officer and has an active plan for management development and succession; ensuring, in cooperation with the Chairman and the Board, that there is an effective succession plan in place for the position of Chief Executive Officer; and serving as the primary spokesperson for Agnico-Eagle. The Chief Executive Officer is to consult with the Chairman on matters of strategic significance to the Company and alert the Chairman on a timely basis of any material changes or events that may impact upon the risk profile, financial affairs or performance of the Company. Chairs of Board Committees The Board has adopted written position descriptions for each of the Chairs of the Board Committees which include the Audit Committee, the Corporate Governance Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Health, Safety and Environment Committee. The role of each of the Chairs is to ensure the effective functioning of his or her committee and provide leadership to its members in discharging the mandate as set out in the committee's charter. The responsibilities of each Chair include, among others: establishing procedures to govern his or her committee's work and ensure the full discharge of its duties; chairing every meeting of his or her committee and encourage free and open discussion at such meetings; reporting to the Board on behalf of his or her committee; and attending every meeting of shareholders and responding to such questions from shareholders as may be put to the Chair of his or her committee. Each of the Chairs is also responsible for carrying out other duties as requested by the Board, depending on need and circumstances. Orientation and Continuing Education Agnico-Eagle holds periodic educational sessions with its directors and legal counsel to review and assess the Board's corporate governance policies. This allows new directors to become familiar with the corporate governance policies of Agnico-Eagle as they relate to its business. 105 Ethical Business Conduct The Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which provides a framework for directors, officers and employees on the conduct and ethical decision-making integral to their work. In addition, the Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Consultants and Contractors. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring compliance with these codes of ethics and any waivers or amendments thereto can only be made by the Board or a Board Committee. These codes are available on www.sedar.com. The Board has also adopted a Confidential Anonymous Complaint Reporting Policy which provides procedures for officers and employees who believe that a violation of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics has occurred to report this violation on a confidential and anonymous basis. Complaints can be made internally to the General Counsel, Senior Vice-President, Legal and Corporate Secretary or the Senior Vice-President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Complaints can also be made anonymously by telephone, e-mail or postal letter through a hotline provided by an independent third party service provider. The General Counsel, Senior Vice-President, Legal and Corporate Secretary periodically prepares a written report to the Audit Committee regarding the complaints, if any, received through these procedures. The Board believes that providing a procedure for employees and officers to raise concerns about ethical conduct on an anonymous and confidential basis fosters a culture of ethical conduct within the Company. Nomination of Directors The Corporate Governance Committee, which is comprised entirely of non-management and independent directors, is responsible for participating in the recruitment and recommendation of new nominees for appointment or election to the Board. When considering a potential candidate, the Corporate Governance Committee considers the qualities and skills that the Board, as a whole, should have and assesses the competencies and skills of the current members of the Board. Based on the talent already represented on the Board, the Corporate Governance Committee then identifies the specific skills, personal qualities or experiences that a candidate should possess in light of the opportunities and risks facing the Company. The Corporate Governance Committee maintains a list of potential director candidates for its future consideration and may engage outside advisors to assist in identifying potential candidates. Potential candidates are screened to ensure that they possess the requisite qualities, including integrity, business judgment and experience, business or professional expertise, independence from management, international experience, financial literacy, excellent communications skills and the ability to work well in a team situation. The Corporate Governance Committee also considers the existing commitments of a potential candidate to ensure that such candidate will be able to fulfill his or her duties as a Board member. Compensation Remuneration is paid to the Company's directors based on several factors, including time commitments, risk, workload and responsibility demanded by their positions. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews and fixes the amount and composition of the compensation of directors. For a summary of remuneration paid to directors, please see " Compensation of Directors and Other Information" and the description of the Compensation Committee below. Board Committees The Board has four Committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Governance Committee and the Health, Safety and Environment Committee. Audit Committee The Audit Committee has two primary objectives. The first is to advise the Board in its oversight responsibilities regarding: the quality and integrity of the Company's financial reports and information; the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; 106 the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls for finance, accounting, internal audit, ethics and legal and regulatory compliance; the performance of the Company's auditing, accounting and financial reporting functions; the fairness of related party agreements and arrangements between the Company and related parties; and the independent auditors' performance, qualifications and independence. The second primary objective of the Audit Committee is to prepare the reports required to be included in the management proxy circular in accordance with applicable laws or the rules of applicable securities regulatory authorities. The Board has adopted an Audit Committee charter, which provides that each member of the Audit Committee must be unrelated to and independent from the Company as determined by the Board in accordance with the applicable requirements of the laws governing the Company, the applicable stock exchanges on which the Company's securities are listed and applicable securities regulatory authorities. In addition, each member must be financially literate and at least one member of the Audit Committee must be an audit committee financial expert, as the term is defined in SOX. The Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit engagements to be provided by the external auditors to the Company. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing all financial statements prior to approval by the Board, all other disclosures containing financial information and all management reports which accompany any financial statements. The Audit Committee is also responsible for all internal and external audit plans, any recommendation affecting the Company's internal controls, the results of internal and external audits and any changes in accounting practices or policies. The Audit Committee reviews any accruals, provisions, estimates or related party transactions that have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements and any litigation, claim or other contingency that could have a material effect upon the Company's financial statements. In addition, the Audit Committee is responsible for assessing management's programs and policies relating to the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's accounting and financial systems. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer the procedures undertaken in connection with their certifications for annual filings in accordance with the requirements of applicable securities regulatory authorities. The Audit Committee is also responsible for recommending to the Board the external auditor to be nominated for shareholder approval who will be responsible for preparing audited financial statements and completing other audit, review or attest services. The Audit Committee also recommends to the Board the compensation to be paid to the external auditor and directly oversees its work. The Company's external auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reports directly to the Board. The Audit Committee is entitled to retain (at the Company's expense) and determine the compensation of any independent counsel, accountants or other advisors to assist the Audit Committee in its oversight responsibilities. The Audit Committee is composed entirely of outside directors who are unrelated to and independent from the Company (currently, Mr. Leiderman (Chair), Dr. Baker, Mr. Kraft, Mr. Nasso and Mr. Roberts), each of whom is financially literate, as the term is used in the CSA's Multilateral Instrument 52-110  Audit Committees. In addition, Mr. Leiderman and Mr. Kraft are Chartered Accountants; Mr. Leiderman is currently active in private practice and Mr. Kraft is recently retired and, as such, qualify as audit committee financial experts, as the term is defined in SOX. The education and experience of each member of the Audit Committee is set out under " Directors and Senior Management". Fees paid to the Company's auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, are set out under "Item 10 Additional Information  Audit Fees". The Audit Committee met five times in 2008. Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things: recommending to the Board policies relating to compensation of the Company's executive officers; 107 recommending to the Board the amount and composition of annual compensation to be paid to the Company's executive officers; matters relating to pension, stock option and other incentive plans for the benefit of executive officers; administering the Company's Stock Option Plan; reviewing and fixing the amount and composition of annual compensation to be paid to members of the Board and committees; and reviewing and assessing the design and competitiveness of the Company's compensation and benefits programs generally. The Compensation Committee reports directly to the Board. The charter of the Compensation Committee provides that each member of the Compensation Committee must be unrelated and independent. The Compensation Committee is composed entirely of outside directors who are unrelated to and independent from the Company (currently, Dr. Baker (Chair), Mr. Beaumont, Mr. Davis, Mr. Leiderman and Mr. Stockford). The Compensation Committee met seven times in 2008. Corporate Governance Committee The Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things: evaluating the Company's governance practices; developing its response to the Company's Statement of Corporate Governance and recommending changes to the Company's governance structures or processes as it may from time to time consider necessary or desirable; reviewing on an annual basis the charters of the Board and of each committee of the Board and recommending any changes; assessing annually the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and recommending any changes; reviewing on a periodic basis the composition of the Board to ensure that there remain an appropriate number of independent directors; and participating in the recruitment and recommendation of new nominees for appointment or election to the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee also provides a forum for a discussion of matters not readily discussed in a full Board meeting. The charter of the Corporate Governance Committee provides that each member of the Corporate Governance Committee must be independent, as such term is defined in the CSA rules. The Corporate Governance Committee is composed entirely of outside directors who are unrelated to and independent from the Company (currently, Mr. Beaumont (Chair), Mr. Kraft, Mr. Nasso, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Voutilainen). The Corporate Governance Committee met four times in 2008. Health, Safety and Environment Committee The Health, Safety and Environment Committee is responsible for, among other things: monitoring and reviewing health, safety and environmental policies, principles, practices and processes; overseeing health, safety and environmental performance; and monitoring and reviewing current and future regulatory issues relating to health, safety and the environment. The Health, Safety and Environment Committee reports directly to the Board and provides a forum to review health, safety and environmental issues in a more thorough and detailed manner than could be adopted by the full Board. The Health, Safety and Environment Committee charter provides that a majority of the members of the Committee be unrelated and independent. 108 The Health, Safety and Environment Committee is comprised of four outside directors who are unrelated to and independent from the Company (currently Mr. Stockford (Chair), Mr. Davis, Mr. Nasso and Mr. Voutilainen) and one non-independent director (Mr. Scherkus, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company). The Health, Safety and Environment Committee met four times in 2008. Assessment of Directors The Company's Corporate Governance Committee (see description of the Corporate Governance Committee above) is responsible for the assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and participates in the recruitment and recommendation of new nominees for appointment or election to the Board. Each of the directors completes a detailed annual assessment questionnaire on the Board and Board Committees. The assessment addresses performance of the Board, each Board committee and individual directors, including through a peer to peer evaluation. A broad range of topics is covered such as Board and Board Committee structure and composition, succession planning, risk management, director competencies and Board processes and effectiveness. The assessments help identify opportunities for continuing Board and director development and also forms the basis of continuing Board participation.

In each case, shareholdings constitute less than one percent of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company. The total number of common shares held by directors and executive officers constitutes less than 0.3% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company. (2)As of December 31, 2008. 110 ITEM 7 MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Major Shareholders To the knowledge of the directors and senior officers of the Company, as of March 25, 2009, no person or corporation beneficially owns or exercises control or direction over common shares of the Company carrying more than 5% of the voting rights attached to all common shares of the Company. As of March 25, 2009, there were 4,097 holders of record of Agnico-Eagle's 155,402,618 outstanding common shares, of which 3,447 holders of record were in the United States and held 47,820,266 common shares or about 30.77% of the outstanding common shares. The Company is not aware of any arrangements the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the Company. To the best knowledge of the Company, it is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation, by any government or by any natural or legal person severally or jointly. Related Party Transactions Prior to December 31, 2002, the Company loaned C$4,034,406 to Contact Diamond Corporation ("Contact"), which was, at the time, an associate of the Company, to fund Contact's ongoing exploration and operating activity (the "Contact Loan"). The rate of interest on the Contact Loan was 8% per annum; however, the Company waived the interest on the Contact Loan from May 13, 2002 until September 30, 2006. The largest amount outstanding under the Contact Loan was C$4,009,826 during 2007 and, as discussed further below, the Contact Loan was repaid in full on February 12, 2007. In September 2006 the Company tendered its interest in Contact in connection with a share exchange take-over bid made by Stornoway for Contact. The Company acquired 4,968,747 common shares of Stornoway through the tender of its entire interest (approximately 31%) in Contact to this take-over bid. Additionally in September 2006, the Company obtained an additional interest in Stornoway through the purchase of subscription receipts of Stornoway for $22.5 million, through which the Company acquired an additional 17,629,084 Stornoway common shares. On January 17, 2007, Stornoway completed its acquisition of Contact by means of a compulsory acquisition. The Contact Loan was repaid in full under a note assignment agreement dated February 12, 2007 between the Company, Contact and Stornoway and the Company was issued 3,207,861 common shares of Stornoway in satisfaction of principal and accrued interest under the Contact Loan. Amounts repaid under the note assignment agreement included C$22,237 in respect of interest accrued in 2007. The book value of the Contact Loan on the Company's consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2007 was nil. In addition, on March 16, 2007, the Company subscribed for C$10 million of 12% unsecured convertible debentures issued by Stornoway due 2009. On July 31, 2008, the Company purchased from treasury 12,222,222 common shares of Stornoway at a price of C$0.90 per common share. Stornoway used the proceeds of the private placement to redeem the C$10 million principal amount of convertible debentures held by the Company and to pay to the Company a C$1 million amendment fee in connection with the amendment of the debentures to permit early redemption. The Company received an additional 527,947 common shares of Stornoway in satisfaction of accrued but unpaid interest on the debentures prior to their redemption. As a result of these transactions, the Company increased its holdings in Stornoway from 27,520,809 common shares (approximately 13.6% of the issued and outstanding common shares) to 40,270,978 common shares (approximately 15.8% of the issued and outstanding common shares). ITEM 8 FINANCIAL INFORMATION The consolidated financial statements furnished pursuant to Item 18 are presented in accordance with US GAAP. During the period under review, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company's operations. The Company is not aware of any legal or arbitration proceedings which may have, or have had in the recent past, a significant effect on the Company's financial position or profitability. 111 Dividend Policy The Company's policy is to pay annual dividends on its common shares and, on December 11, 2008, the Company announced that it had declared a dividend of C$0.18 per common share payable on March 27, 2009. In 2008, the dividend paid was C$0.18 per common share, in 2007, the dividend paid was C$0.12 per common share and in 2006, the dividend paid was C$0.03 per common share, unchanged since 2003. Although the Company expects to continue paying an annual cash dividend, future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be subject to such factors as the Company's earnings, financial condition and capital requirements. The Company's Credit Facilities each contain covenants that restrict the Company's ability to declare or pay dividends if a default under the Credit Facility has occurred or would result from the declaration or payment of the dividend.

The registrar and transfer agent for the common shares is Computershare Trust Company of Canada, Toronto, Ontario. On February 15, 2006 (the "Redemption Date"), the Company fully redeemed its $143.75 million principal amount, 4.50% convertible subordinated debentures due February 15, 2012 (the "Debentures") for common shares of the Company. The Company issued an aggregate of 10,259,068 common shares in satisfaction of its obligations under the Debentures, of which 70,520 common shares were issued on the redemption of $1,111,000 principal amount of Debentures that were redeemed and 10,188,548 common shares were issued on the conversion of $142,639,000 of Debentures that occurred prior to the Redemption Date. The Company paid cash to satisfy interest that had accrued up to and including February 15, 2006. ITEM 10 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Memorandum and Articles of Incorporation Articles of Amendment The Company's articles of incorporation do not place any restrictions on the Company's objects and purposes. For more information, see the Articles of Amendment incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this Form 20-F. Certain Powers of Directors The Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the "OBCA") requires that every director who is a party to a material contract or transaction or a proposed material contract or transaction with a corporation, or who is a director or officer of, or has a material interest in, any person who is a party to a material contract or transaction or a proposed material contract or transaction with the corporation, shall disclose in writing to the corporation or request to have entered in the minutes of the meetings of directors the nature and extent of his or her interest, and shall refrain from voting in respect of the material contract or transaction or proposed material contract or transaction unless the contract or transaction is: (a) one relating primarily to his or her remuneration as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or an affiliate; (b) one for indemnity of or insurance for directors as contemplated under the OBCA; or (c) one with an affiliate. However, a director who is prohibited by the OBCA from voting on a material contract or proposed material contract may be counted in 113 determining whether a quorum is present for the purpose of the resolution, if the director disclosed his or her interest in accordance with the OBCA and the contract or transaction was reasonable and fair to the corporation at the time it was approved. The Company's by-laws provide that the directors shall from time to time determine, by resolution, the remuneration to be paid to the directors, which shall be in addition to the salary paid to any officer or employee of the Company who is also a director. The directors may also, by resolution, award special remuneration to any director in undertaking any special services on the Company's behalf other than the normal work ordinarily required of a director of the Company. The by-laws provide that confirmation of any such resolution by the Company's shareholders is not required. The Company's by-laws also provide that the directors may: (a) borrow money upon the credit of the Company; (b) issue, reissue, sell or pledge bonds, debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness or guarantee of the Company, whether secured or unsecured; (c) to the extent permitted by the OBCA, give directly or indirectly financial assistance to any person by means of a loan, a guarantee on behalf of the Company to secure performance of any present or future indebtedness, liability or other obligation of any person, or otherwise; and (d) mortgage, hypothecate, pledge or otherwise create a security interest in all or any currently owned or subsequently acquired real or personal, movable or immovable, tangible or intangible property of the Company to secure any such bonds, debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness or guarantee or any other present or future indebtedness, liability or other obligation of the Company. The directors may, by resolution, amend or repeal any by-laws that regulate the business or affairs of the Company. The OBCA requires the directors to submit any such amendment or repeal to the Company's shareholders at the next meeting of shareholders, and the shareholders may confirm, reject or amend the amendment or repeal. Retirement of Directors Effective as of February 21, 2007, the Board discontinued the mandatory retirement policy for directors based solely on age. Due in part to the Company's practice of conducting annual Board, committee and individual director evaluations, the Board approved and adopted a resignation policy primarily based on the directors' performance, commitment, skills and experience. As set out in greater detail under "Item 6 Directors, Senior Management and Employees  Board Practices  Assessment of Directors", each director's performance will continue to be evaluated annually. Directors' Share Ownership As of March 17, 2004, directors, other than Mr. Boyd, Mr. Scherkus and Mr. Garofalo, are required to own the equivalent of at least three years of their annual retainer fee in the Company's stock. Directors have a period of three years to achieve this ownership level either through open market purchases or through participation in the Employee Share Purchase Plan. Meetings of Shareholders The OBCA requires the Company to call an annual shareholders' meeting not later than 15 months after holding the last preceding annual meeting and permits the Company to call a special shareholders' meeting at any time. In addition, in accordance with the OBCA, the holders of not less than 5% of the Company's shares carrying the right to vote at a meeting sought to be held may requisition the directors to call a special shareholders' meeting for the purposes stated in the requisition. The Company is required to mail a notice of meeting and management information circular to registered shareholders not less than 21 days and not more than 50 days prior to the date of any annual or special shareholders' meeting. These materials are also filed with Canadian securities regulatory authorities and furnished to the SEC. The Company's by-laws provide that a quorum of two shareholders in person or represented by proxy holding or representing by proxy not less than 10% of the Company's issued shares carrying the right to vote at the meeting is required to transact business at a shareholders' meeting. At the Company's annual and special meeting of shareholders anticipated to be held on April 30, 2009, shareholders of the Company will be asked to vote on an ordinary resolution to increase the quorum requirement to two shareholders in person or represented by proxy holding or representing by proxy not 114 less than 25% of the Company's issued shares carrying the right to vote. Shareholders, and their duly appointed proxies and corporate representatives, as well as the Company's auditors, are entitled to be admitted to the Company's annual and special shareholders' meetings. Authorized Capital The Company's authorized capital consists of an unlimited number of shares of one class designated as common shares. The Company may not create any class or series of shares or make any modification to the provisions attaching to the Company's common shares without the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes cast by the holders of the common shares. The Company's common shares do not have pre-emptive rights to purchase additional shares. Majority Voting Policy As part of its ongoing review of corporate governance practices, on February 20, 2008, the Board adopted a policy providing that in an uncontested election of directors, any nominee who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" than votes "for" will tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board promptly following the shareholders' meeting. The Corporate Governance Committee will consider the offer of resignation and will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept it. In considering whether or not to accept the resignation, the Corporate Governance Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant by members of such Committee. The Corporate Governance Committee will be expected to accept the resignation except in situations where the considerations would warrant the applicable director continuing to serve on the Board. The Board will make its final decision and announce it in a news release within 90 days following the shareholders' meeting. A director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this policy will not participate in any meeting of the Board or the Corporate Governance Committee at which the resignation is considered. Disclosure of Share Ownership The Securities Act (Ontario) provides that a person or company that beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, voting securities of an issuer or that exercises control or direction over voting securities of an issuer or a combination of both, carrying more than 10% of the voting rights attached to all the issuer's outstanding voting securities (an "insider") must, within 10 days of becoming an insider, file a report in the required form effective the date on which the person became an insider, disclosing any direct or indirect beneficial ownership of, or control or direction over, securities of the reporting issuer. The Securities Act (Ontario) also provides for the filing of a report by an insider of a reporting issuer who acquires or transfers securities of the issuer or who enters into, materially amends or terminates an arrangement the effect of which is to alter the insider's economic interest in a security of the issuer or the insiders economic exposure to the issuer. These reports must be filed within 10 days after the acquisition or transfer takes place or the arrangement is entered into, materially amended or terminated. If rules proposed by the Canadian Securities Administrators on December 18, 2008 take effect, these reports will be required to be filed within five days after the applicable event. The Securities Act (Ontario) also provides that a person or company that acquires (whether or not by way of a take-over bid, offer to acquire or subscription from treasury) beneficial ownership of voting or equity securities or securities convertible into voting or equity securities of a reporting issuer that, together with previously held securities brings the total holdings of such holder to 10% or more of the outstanding securities of that class, must (a) issue and file forthwith a news release containing the prescribed information and (b) file a report within two business days containing the same information set out in the news release. The acquiring person or company must also issue a news release and file a report each time it acquires an additional 2% or more of the outstanding securities of the same class and every time there is a change to any material fact in the news release and report previously issued and filed. The rules in the United States governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed are more stringent than those discussed above. Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), imposes reporting requirements on persons who acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than 5% of a class of an equity security registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. In general, such persons must file, within 10 days after such 115 acquisition, a report of beneficial ownership with the SEC containing the information prescribed by the regulations under Section 13 of the Exchange Act and promptly file an amendment to such report to disclose any material change to the information reported, including any acquisition or disposition of 1% of the outstanding securities of the registered class. Material Contracts The Company believes the following contracts constitute the only material contracts to which it is a party. Credit Agreements The Company entered into the First Credit Facility on January 10, 2008 with a group of financial institutions providing for a $300 million unsecured revolving bank credit facility that replaced the Company's previous secured revolving bank credit facility. The First Credit Facility matures and all indebtedness thereunder is due and payable on January 10, 2013. The Company, with the consent of lenders representing at least 662/3% of the aggregate commitments under the facility, has the option to extend the term of the facility for additional one-year terms. The First Credit Facility is available in multiple currencies through prime rate and base rate advances, priced at the applicable rate plus a margin that ranges from zero to 0.60% depending on certain financial ratios and through LIBOR advances, bankers' acceptances and letters of credit, priced at the applicable rate plus a margin that ranges from 1.00% to 1.60% depending on the financial ratios. The lenders under the First Credit Facility are each paid a standby fee at a rate that ranges from 0.375% to 0.55% of the undrawn portion of the facility, depending on the financial ratios. Payment and performance of the Company's obligations under the First Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain material subsidiaries of the Company (the "Guarantors" and, together with the Company, each an "Obligor"). The Company entered into the Second Credit Facility on September 4, 2008 with a group of financial institutions providing for a $300 million unsecured revolving bank credit facility on substantially the same terms as the First Credit Facility. The Second Credit Facility matures and all indebtedness thereunder is due and payable on September 4, 2010. The Second Credit Facility is available in multiple currencies through prime rate and base rate advances, priced at the applicable rate plus a margin that ranges from zero to 0.60% depending on certain financial ratios and through LIBOR advances and bankers' acceptances, priced at the applicable rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.00% to 1.60% depending on the financial ratios. The lenders under the Second Credit Facility are each paid a standby fee at a rate that ranges from 0.375% to 0.55% of the undrawn portion of the facility, depending on the financial ratios. Payment and performance of the Company's obligations under the Second Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Guarantors. In connection with entering into the Second Credit Facility, on September 4, 2008, the First Credit Facility was amended to, among other things, deem the Second Credit Facility to be a "permitted debt" under the First Credit Facility. The Second Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants and events of default identical to those in the First Credit Facility. The Company is also required to maintain the same financial ratios as well as the same minimum tangible net worth under both facilities. Both facilities require the Company to utilize funds available under the First Credit Facility and the Second Credit Facility on a pro rata basis (excluding funds advanced under the First Credit Facility by way of letters of credit or swing line advances) such that at any time the amount outstanding under either the First Credit Facility or Second Credit Facility, as a percentage of the aggregate amount available under such facility, does not differ by more than 10 percentage points of the amount outstanding under the other Credit Facility, as a percentage of the amount available thereunder. The facilities contain covenants that restrict, among other things, the ability of an Obligor to: incur additional indebtedness; pay or declare dividends or make other restricted distributions or payments in respect of any shares of the Company's equity securities after a default or an event of default that is continuing; make sales or other dispositions of material assets; create liens on its existing or future assets; enter into transactions with affiliates other than the Obligors, except on arm's length terms; 116 make any loans to or investments in businesses other than those related to mining or a business ancillary or complementary to mining; amalgamate or otherwise transfer its assets; and carry on business other than those related to mining or a business ancillary or complementary to mining. The Company is also required to maintain certain financial ratios as well as a minimum tangible net worth. Events of default under the Credit Facilities include, among other things: the failure to pay principal when due and payable or interest, fees or other amounts payable within five business days of such amounts becoming due and payable; the breach by the Company of any financial covenant; the breach by any Obligor of any other term, covenant or other agreement that is not cured within 30 business days after written notice of the breach has been given to the Company; a default under any other indebtedness of the Obligors if the effect of such default is to accelerate, or to permit the acceleration of, the due date of such indebtedness in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more; a change in control of the Company which is defined to occur upon (a) the acquisition, directly or indirectly, by any means whatsoever, by any person, or group of persons acting jointly or in concert, (collectively, an "offeror") of beneficial ownership of, or the power to exercise control or direction over, or securities convertible or exchangeable into, any securities of the Company carrying in aggregate (assuming the exercise of all such conversion or exchange rights in favour of the offeror) more than 50% of the aggregate votes represented by the voting stock then issued and outstanding or otherwise entitling the offeror to elect a majority of the board of directors of the Company, or (b) the replacement by way of election or appointment at any time of one-half or more of the total number of the then incumbent members of the board of directors of the Company, or the election or appointment of new directors comprising one-half or more of the total number of members of the board of directors in office immediately following such election or appointment; unless, in any such case, the nomination of such directors for election or their appointment is approved by the board of directors of the Company in office immediately preceding such nomination or appointment in circumstances where such nomination or appointment is made other than as a result of a dissident public proxy solicitation, whether actual or threatened; and various events relating to the bankruptcy or insolvency or winding-up, liquidation or dissolution or cessation of business of any Obligor. As at March 25, 2009 there was approximately $415 million in the aggregate drawn under the Credit Facilities, excluding $57 million in letters of credit. Stock Option Plan The Company has a Stock Option Plan for directors, officers, employees and service providers to the Company. See "Item 6 Directors, Senior Management and Employees  Compensation of Officers  Stock Option Plan". A copy of the Stock Option Plan is attached as Exhibit 4.04 to this Form 20-F. Employee Share Purchase Plan The Company has the Employee Share Purchase Plan for officers and full-time employees of the Company. See "Item 6 Directors, Senior Management and Employees  Compensation of Executive Officers  Employee Share Purchase Plan". A copy of the Employee Share Purchase Plan is attached as Exhibit 4.05 to this Form 20-F. 117 Exchange Controls Canada has no system of exchange controls. There are no Canadian restrictions on the repatriation of capital or earnings of a Canadian public company to non-resident investors. There are no laws in Canada or exchange restrictions affecting the remittance of dividends, profits, interest, royalties and other payments to non-resident holders of the Company's securities, except as discussed in "Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations" below. Restrictions on Share Ownership by Non-Canadians There are no limitations under the laws of Canada or in the constating documents of the Company on the right of foreigners to hold or vote securities of the Company, except that the Investment Canada Act may require review and approval by the Minister of Industry (Canada) of certain acquisitions of "control" of the Company by a "non-Canadian". The threshold for acquisitions of "control" is generally defined as being one-third or more of the voting shares of the Company. "Non-Canadian" generally means an individual who is not a Canadian citizen, or a corporation, partnership, trust or joint venture that is ultimately controlled by non-Canadians. Corporate Governance The Company is subject to a variety of corporate governance guidelines and requirements enacted by the TSX, the CSA and the NYSE and by the SEC under its rules and those mandated by SOX. Today, the Company meets and often exceeds not only corporate governance legal requirements in Canada and the United States, but also the best practices recommended by securities regulators. The Company is listed on the NYSE and, although the Company is not required to comply with all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements to which the Company would be subject if the Company were a U.S. corporation, the Company's governance practices differ significantly from those required of U.S. domestic issuers in the following respects. The NYSE rules for U.S. domestic issuers require shareholder approval of all equity compensation plans regardless of whether new issuances, treasury shares or shares that the Company has purchased in the open market are used. The TSX rules require shareholder approval of share compensation arrangements involving new issuances of shares, and of certain amendments to such arrangements, but do not require such approval if the compensation arrangements involve only shares purchased by the company in the open market. The NYSE rules for U.S. domestic issuers also require shareholder approval of any transaction or series of related transactions that results in the issuance of common shares, or securities convertible into or exercisable for common shares, that has, or will have upon issuance, voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power outstanding prior to the transaction or if the issuance of common shares, or securities convertible into or exercisable for common shares, is, or will be upon issuance, equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of common shares outstanding prior to the transaction. The TSX rules require shareholder approval of acquisition transactions resulting in dilution in excess of 25%; however, issuances in connection with acquisitions of a reporting issuer (or the equivalent) are generally exempt from these shareholder approval requirements provided the target has over 50 beneficial owners (excluding insiders and employees). The TSX also has broad general discretion to require shareholder approval in connection with any issuances of listed securities. The Company complies with the TSX rules. A certificate of Sean Boyd, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, will be submitted to the NYSE on March 31, 2009 certifying that he was not aware of any violation by the Company of the NYSE's corporate governance listing standards. Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations The following is a brief summary of some of the principal Canadian federal income tax consequences generally applicable to a holder of common shares of the Company (a "U.S. holder") who deals at arm's length with the Company, holds the shares as capital property and who, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the "Act") and the Canada-United States Income Tax Convention (the "Treaty"), is at all relevant times resident in the United States, is not and is not deemed to be resident in Canada and does not use or hold and is not deemed to use or hold the shares in carrying on a business in Canada. Special rules, which are not 118 discussed below, may apply to a U.S. holder which is an insurer that carries on business in Canada and elsewhere. This summary is of a general nature only and is not, and should not be interpreted as, legal or tax advice to any particular U.S. holder and no representation is made with respect to the Canadian income tax consequences to any particular person. Accordingly, U.S. holders are advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect to their particular circumstances. Under the Act and the Treaty, a U.S. holder of common shares (including an individual or estate) who is entitled to full benefits under the Treaty will generally be subject to a 15% withholding tax on dividends paid or credited or deemed by the Act to have been paid or credited on such shares. The dividends may be exempt from such withholding in the case of some U.S. holders such as qualifying pension funds and charities. A U.S. holder who is not entitled to full benefits under the Treaty (or to the benefits of the Dividends Article of the Treaty) will generally be subject to Canadian withholding tax at the rate of 25% on such dividends. In general, a U.S. holder will not be subject to Canadian income tax on capital gains arising on the disposition of shares of the Company at a time that the Company's shares are listed on the TSX or the NYSE unless (i) at any time in the 60-month period immediately preceding the disposition, 25% or more of the shares of any class or series of the capital stock of the Company was owned by the U.S. holder, persons with whom the U.S. holder did not deal at arm's length or the U.S. holder and such persons and (ii) the value of the common shares of the Company at the time of the disposition derives principally from real property (as defined in the Treaty) situated in Canada. For this purpose, the Treaty defines real property situated in Canada to include rights to explore for or exploit mineral deposits and other natural resources situated in Canada, rights to amounts computed by reference to the amount or value of production from such resources, certain other rights in respect of natural resources situated in Canada and shares of a corporation the value of whose shares is derived principally from real property situated in Canada. United States Federal Income Tax Considerations The following is a brief summary of some of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences to a holder of common shares of the Company, who deals at arm's length with the Company, holds the shares as a capital asset and who, for the purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and the Treaty, is at all relevant times a U.S Stockholder (as defined below). As used herein, the term "U.S. Stockholder" means a holder of common shares of the Company who (for United States federal income tax purposes): (a) is a citizen or resident of the United States; (b) is a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any state therein; (c) is an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (d) is a trust if either (i) such trust has validly elected to be treated as a U.S. person or (ii) is subject to both the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more U.S. persons with respect to all substantial trust decisions. This summary is based on the Code, final and temporary Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, United States court decisions, published rulings and administrative positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") interpreting the Code, and the Treaty, as applicable and, in each case, as in effect and available as of the date of this Form 20-F. Any of the authorities on which this summary is based could be changed in a material and adverse manner at any time, and any such change could be applied on a retroactive basis and could affect the United States federal income tax consequences described in this summary. This summary does not discuss the potential effects, whether adverse or beneficial, of any proposed legislation that, if enacted, could be applied on a retroactive basis. This summary does not describe United States federal estate and gift tax considerations, nor does it describe regional, state and local tax considerations within the United States. The following summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the possible tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or dispose of the common shares. In particular, this summary only deals with a holder who will hold the common shares as a capital asset and who does not own, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of our voting shares or of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries. This summary does not address all of the tax 119 consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances, including but not limited to application of alternative minimum tax or rules applicable to taxpayers in special circumstances. Special rules may apply, for instance, to tax-exempt entities, banks, insurance companies, S corporations, dealers in securities or currencies, persons who will hold common shares as a position in a "straddle", hedge, constructive sale or "conversion transaction" for U.S. tax purposes, persons who have a "functional currency" other than the US dollar or persons subject to U.S. taxation as expatriates. Furthermore, in general, this discussion does not address the tax consequences applicable to holders that are treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States federal income tax purposes. This summary is of a general nature only and is not, and should not be interpreted as, legal or tax advice to any particular U.S. Stockholder and no representation is made with respect to the U.S. income tax consequences to any particular person. Accordingly, U.S. Stockholders are advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect to their particular circumstances. Dividends For United States federal income tax purposes, the gross amount of all distributions, if any, paid with respect to the common shares out of current or accumulated earnings and profits ("E&P") to a U.S. Stockholder generally will be treated as foreign source dividend income to such holder, even though the U.S. Stockholder generally receives only a portion of the gross amount (after giving effect to the Canadian withholding tax as potentially reduced by the Treaty). United States corporations that hold the common shares generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction that applies to dividends received from United States corporations. To the extent a distribution exceeds E&P, it will be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Stockholder's adjusted basis and then as gain from the sale of a capital asset. In the case of certain non-corporate U.S. Stockholders including individuals and certain estates and trusts, gains recognized prior to 2011 from the sale of a capital asset held for longer than 12 months are taxable at a maximum federal income tax rate of 15%, while gains from the sale of a capital asset that does not meet such holding period are taxable at the rates applicable to ordinary income. Certain dividends paid prior to 2011 to certain non-corporate U.S. Stockholders including individuals and certain estates and trusts generally are also subject to the 15% maximum rate. The reduced tax rates generally are available only with respect to dividends received from U.S. corporations, and from non-U.S. corporations (a) that are eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that the U.S. Treasury Department determines to be satisfactory and that contains an exchange of information program, or (b) whose stock is readily tradeable on an established securities market in the United States. In addition, the reduced tax rates are not available with respect to dividends received from a foreign corporation that was a passive foreign investment company in either the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year. Special rules may apply, however, to cause such dividends to be taxable at the higher rates applicable to ordinary income. For example, the reduced tax rates are not available with respect to a dividend on shares where the U.S. Stockholder does not continuously own such shares for more than 60 days during the 120-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date. Many other complex and special rules may apply as a condition to, or as a result of, the application of the reduced tax rate on dividends. U.S. Stockholders are advised to consult their own tax advisors. For United States federal income tax purposes, the amount of any dividend paid in Canadian dollars will be the United States dollar value of the Canadian dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividend is properly included in income, whether or not the Canadian dollars are converted into United States dollars at that time. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Stockholder on a sale or exchange of the Canadian dollars will generally be United States source ordinary income or loss. The withholding tax imposed by Canada generally is a creditable foreign tax for United States federal income tax purposes. Therefore, the U.S. Stockholder generally will be entitled to include the amount withheld as a foreign tax paid in computing a foreign tax credit (or in computing a deduction for foreign income taxes paid, if the holder does not elect to use the foreign tax credit provisions of the Code). The Code, however, imposes a number of limitations on the use of foreign tax credits, based on the particular facts and circumstances of each taxpayer. Investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit. 120 U.S. Stockholders that do not elect to claim foreign tax credit for a taxable year, may be eligible to deduct such withholding tax imposed by Canada. Capital Gains Subject to the discussion below under the heading " Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations", gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Stockholder on the sale or other disposition of the common shares will be subject to United States federal income taxation as capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between such U.S. Stockholder's adjusted basis in the common shares and the amount realized upon its disposition. Gain on the sale of common shares held for more than one year by certain non-corporate U.S. Stockholders, including individuals and certain estates and trusts, will be taxable at a maximum rate of 15%. A reduced rate does not apply to capital gains realized by a U.S. Stockholder that is a corporation. Capital losses are generally deductible only against capital gains and not against ordinary income. In the case of an individual, however, unused capital losses in excess of capital gains may offset up to $3,000 annually of ordinary income. Capital gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Stockholder on the sale or other disposition of common shares will generally be sourced in the United States. Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations The Company will be classified as a passive foreign investment company (a "PFIC") for United States federal income tax purposes if either (i) 75% or more of its gross income is passive income or (ii) on average for the taxable year, 50% or more of its assets (by value) produce or are held for the production of passive income. Based on projections of the Company's income and assets and the manner in which the Company intends to manage its business, the Company expects that the Company will not be a PFIC. However, there can be no assurance that this will actually be the case. If the Company were to be classified as a PFIC, the consequences to a U.S. Stockholder will depend in part on whether the U.S. Stockholder has made a "Mark-to-Market Election" or a "QEF Election" with respect to the Company. If the Company is a PFIC during a U.S. Stockholder's holding period and the U.S. Stockholder does not make a Mark-to-Market Election or a QEF Election, the U.S. Stockholder will generally be subject to special rules including interest charges. If a U.S. Stockholder makes a Mark-to-Market Election, the U.S. Stockholder would generally be required to include in its income the excess of the fair market value of the common shares as of the close of each taxable year over the U.S. Stockholder's adjusted basis therein. If the U.S. Stockholder's adjusted basis in the common shares is greater than the fair market value of the common shares as of the close of the taxable year, the U.S. Stockholder may deduct such excess, but only up to the aggregate amount of ordinary income previously included as a result of the Mark-to-Market Election, reduced by any previous deduction taken. The U.S. Stockholder's adjusted basis in its common shares will be increased by the amount of income or reduced by the amount of deductions resulting from the Mark-to-Market Election. A U.S. Stockholder who makes a QEF Election would generally be currently taxable on its pro rata share of our ordinary earnings and net capital gain (at ordinary income and capital gains rates, respectively) for each taxable year that the Company is classified as a PFIC, even if no dividend distributions were received. If for any year the Company determines that it is properly classified as a PFIC, it will comply with all reporting requirements necessary for a U.S. Stockholder to make a QEF Election and will, promptly following the end of such year and each year thereafter for which the Company is properly classified as a PFIC, provide to U.S. Stockholders the information required by the QEF Election. Under current U.S. law, if the Company is a PFIC in any year, a U.S. Stockholder must file an annual return on IRS Form 8621, which describes the income received (or deemed to be received pursuant to a QEF Election) from the Company, any gain realized on a disposition of common shares and certain other information. 121 Information Reporting; Backup Withholding Tax Dividends on and proceeds arising from a sale of common shares generally will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax, currently at the rate of 28%, if (a) a U.S. Stockholder fails to furnish the U.S. Stockholder's correct United States taxpayer identification number (generally on Form W-9), (b) the withholding agent is advised the U.S. Stockholder furnished an incorrect United States taxpayer identification number, (c) the withholding agent is notified by the IRS that the U.S. Stockholder has previously failed to properly report items subject to backup withholding tax, or (d) the U.S. Stockholder fails to certify, under penalty of perjury, that the U.S. Stockholder has furnished its correct U.S. taxpayer identification number and that the IRS has not notified the U.S. Stockholder that it is subject to backup withholding tax. However, U.S. Stockholders that are corporations generally are excluded from these information reporting and backup withholding tax rules. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a U.S. Stockholder's United States federal income tax liability, and a U.S. Stockholder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information. Audit Fees Fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP for 2008 and 2007 are set out below.

ITEM 11 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Metal Price and Foreign Currency Agnico-Eagle's net income is most sensitive to metal prices and the Canadian dollar/US dollar exchange rate. For the purpose of the sensitivities set out in the table below, Agnico-Eagle used the following metal price and exchange rate assumptions: Gold  $750 per ounce; Silver  $10.00 per ounce; Zinc  $1,200 per tonne; Copper  $3,700 per tonne; and Canadian dollar/US dollar  C$1.22 per $1.00. Euro/US dollar  $1.28 per €1 Changes in the market prices of gold are due to numerous factors such as demand, global mine production levels, forward selling by producers, central bank sales and investor sentiment. Changes in the market prices of other metals are due to factors such as demand and global mine production levels. Changes in the C$/US$ exchange rate are due to factors such as supply and demand for Canadian and U.S. currencies and economic conditions in each country. In 2008, the ranges of metal prices and exchange rates were: Gold: $682  $1,033 per ounce averaging $872 per ounce; Silver: $8.46  $21.36 per ounce averaging $14.98 per ounce; Zinc: $1,036  $2,822 per tonne averaging $1,874 per tonne; Copper: $2,778  $8995 per tonne averaging $6,944 per tonne; and Canadian dollar/US dollar: C$0.97  C$1.3017 per $1.00 averaging C$1.0669 per $1.00. Euro/US dollar: €0.6246  0.8035 per $1.00 averaging €0.6826 per $1.00. 123 The following table sets out the estimated impact on 2009 total cash costs per ounce of a 10% change in assumed metal prices and exchange rates. A 10% change in each variable was considered in isolation while holding all other assumptions constant. Based on historical market data and 2008 price ranges shown above, a 10% change in assumed metal prices and exchange rates is reasonably likely in 2009. Changes in variable Impact on total cash costs per ounce Canadian dollar/US dollar $ 35 Euro/US dollar $ 7 Zinc $ 14 Silver $ 8 Copper $ 4 In order to mitigate the impact of fluctuating precious and base metal prices, the Company occasionally enters into derivative transactions under its Metal Price Risk Management Policy, approved by the Board. The Company's policy and practice is not to sell forward its gold and silver production. However, the policy does allow the Company to use other hedging strategies where appropriate to ensure an adequate return on new projects. Agnico-Eagle occasionally buys put options and forward contracts to protect minimum base metal prices while maintaining full participation to gold and silver price increases. There were no metal hedging strategies in place during 2008. The Company's policy does not allow speculative trading. The Company receives payment for all of its metal sales in US dollars and pays most of its operating and capital costs in Canadian dollars, Euros or Mexican pesos. This gives rise to significant currency risk exposure. From time to time the Company has entered into currency hedging transactions under the Company's Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy, approved by the Board, to hedge part of its foreign currency exposure. The policy does not permit the hedging of translation exposure (that is, the gains and losses that arise from the accounting translation of Canadian dollar, Euro or Mexican peso denominated assets and liabilities into US dollars) as these do not give rise to cash exposure. The Company's foreign currency derivative strategy consisted of writing US dollar call options with short maturities to generate premiums that would, in essence, enhance the spot transaction rate received when exchanging US dollars to Canadian dollars. All of these derivative transactions expired prior to the year end such that no derivatives were outstanding on December 31, 2008. Throughout 2008, the Company's foreign currency derivative strategy generated $4.5 million in call option premiums. Interest Rates The Company's current exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the drawdown on its Credit Facilities and its investment portfolio. Drawdowns on the Credit Facilities are used, primarily, to fund a portion of the capital expenditures related to the Company's development projects. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had drawn down $200 million on its bank facilities. In addition, the Company usually invests its cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms with a credit rating of R1-High or better. As a result, the Company's interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 31, 2008, there were no short-term investments. Amounts drawn under the Credit Facilities are subject to floating interest rates based on benchmark rates available in the United States and Canada or on LIBOR. In the past, the Company has entered into derivative instruments to hedge against unfavourable changes in interest rates. The Company will continue to monitor its interest rate exposure and may enter into such agreements to manage its exposure to fluctuating interest rates. In 2008, there were no interest rate derivative instruments in place. Derivatives The Company enters into derivative contracts to limit the risk associated with decreased byproduct metal prices. The contracts act as economic hedges of underlying exposures to byproduct metal price risk and foreign currency exchange risk and are not held for speculative purposes. Agnico-Eagle does not use complex derivative 124 contracts to hedge exposures. The Company uses simple contracts, such as puts and calls, to mitigate downside risk yet maintain full participation to rising precious metal prices. Agnico-Eagle also enters into forward contracts to lock in exchange rates based on projected Canadian dollar operating and capital requirements. Using derivative instruments creates various financial risks. Credit risk is the risk that the counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to perform on an obligation to the Company. Credit risk is mitigated by dealing with high quality counterparties such as major stable banks. Market liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative position cannot be liquidated quickly. The Company mitigates market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of derivative contracts over time, usually based on projected production levels for the specific metal being hedged, such that the relevant markets will be able to absorb the contracts. Mark-to-market risk is the risk that an adverse change in market prices for metals will affect financial condition. Since derivative contracts are used as economic hedges, for most of the contracts, changes in the mark-to-market value will affect income. For a description of the accounting treatment of derivative contracts, please see "Item 5 Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Critical Accounting Estimates  Financial Instruments". In addition to writing US dollar call options with short maturities to enhance the spot transaction rate when exchanging US dollars to Canadian dollars, the Company also entered into three zero cost collar contracts in October 2008. The purpose of entering into these zero cost collar contracts was to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates by hedging the functional-currency-equivalent cash flows associated with the Canadian dollar capital expenditures on the Meadowbank mine project. The purchase of US dollar put options was financed through selling US dollar call options at higher exercise prices such that the net premium payable to the different counterparties by the Company is nil. The hedged items represents monthly forecasted Canadian dollar cash outflows pertaining to its Canadian projects during 2009. The cash flow hedging relationship meets all requirements of FAS 133 to be perfectly effective, while unrealized gains and losses are recognized within other comprehensive income. All three of the zero cost collar contracts were outstanding as of December 31, 2008. The risk being hedged is the variability in expected future cash flows arising from changes in foreign currency exchange risk below and above the levels of C$1.07 and C$1.235 per US$. The hedged items represent C$15 million of unhedged forecast Canadian dollar denominated cash outflows per month arising from Canadian dollar denominated capital expenditures in 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value of these hedges was negative $8.9 million. This loss was incurred due to an approximate change of 10% in foreign exchange rate between Canadian dollar and the US dollar from October 2008 to December 31, 2008. The potential loss in fair value of these financial instruments from a hypothetical 10% move in foreign exchange rates against our positions would be lower than the $8.9 million recognized at year-end 2008 due to the non-linearity caused by the time value component. The sensitivity analysis does not take into account the offsetting effect on the potential loss from the underlying trade-related transactions and as such assumes an unlikely adverse case scenario. Also during 2008, the Company sold call options against the shares of Goldcorp Inc. ("Goldcorp") to hedge its price exposure to the Goldcorp shares it acquired in connection with Goldcorp's acquisition of Gold Eagle. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had call options contracts in respect of its Goldcorp shares at a strike price of $44 per share and have now expired. These call option contracts generated approximately C$4 million in premium proceeds during 2008 and expired in the first quarter of 2009. ITEM 12 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES OTHER THAN EQUITY SECURITIES Pursuant to the instructions to Item 12 of Form 20-F, this information is inapplicable and has not been provided. 125 PART II ITEM 13 DEFAULTS, DIVIDEND ARREARAGES AND DELINQUENCIES None/not applicable. ITEM 14 MATERIAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE RIGHTS OF SECURITY HOLDERS AND USE OF PROCEEDS None/not applicable. ITEM 15 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on such evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information the Company is required to disclose in reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management's report on internal control over financial reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by the Company's Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, the Company's management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based upon its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. The Company will continue to periodically review its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and may make modifications from time to time as considered necessary or desireable. 126 Attestation report of the registered public accounting firm Please see "Item 18 Financial Statements  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in internal control over financial reporting Management regularly reviews its system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to the Company's processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that the Company maintains an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 20-F that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 15T CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Not applicable. ITEM 16A AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT The Board has determined that the Company shall have at least one "audit committee financial expert" (as defined in Item 16A of Form 20-F) and that Messrs. Bernie Kraft and Mel Leiderman are the Company's "audit committee financial experts" serving on the Audit Committee of the Board. Each of the audit committee financial experts is "independent" under applicable listing standards. ITEM 16B CODE OF ETHICS The Company has adopted a "code of ethics" (as defined in Item 16B of Form 20-F) that applies to its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, principal accounting officer, controller and persons performing similar functions.

Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, and our report dated March 25, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Toronto, Canada ERNST & YOUNG LLP March 25, 2009 Chartered Accountants Licensed Public Accountants 129 MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited (the "Company") will file with the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on March 30, 2009, the annual written affirmation by its Chief Executive Officer, certifying that, as of the date of such affirmation, he was not aware of any violation by Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited of the NYSE's corporate governance listing standards. The Company has also filed the required certifications under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 regarding the quality of its public disclosures as Exhibits 12.01 and 12.02 to its annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2008. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by the Company's Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, the Company's management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based upon its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. Toronto, Canada March 25, 2009 By /s/ SEAN BOYD Sean Boyd Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer By /s/ DAVID GAROFALO David Garofalo Senior Vice-President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer 130 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. As described in the "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", the Company changed its method of accounting for uncertain tax positions as of January 1, 2007. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 25, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Toronto, Canada ERNST & YOUNG LLP March 25, 2009 Chartered Accountants Licensed Public Accountants 131 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES These consolidated financial statements of Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited ("Agnico-Eagle" or the "Company") are expressed in thousands of United States dollars ("US dollars"), except where noted, and have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("US GAAP"). Since a precise determination of assets and liabilities depends on future events, the preparation of consolidated financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates and approximations. Actual results may differ from such estimates and approximations. The consolidated financial statements have, in management's opinion, been prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the significant accounting policies referred to below. Basis of consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which it has a controlling financial interest after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The Company has a controlling financial interest if it owns a majority of the outstanding voting common stock or has significant control over an entity through contractual or economic interests of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and short-term investments in money market instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Short-term investments are designated as held to maturity for accounting purposes and are carried at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Agnico-Eagle places its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in high quality securities issued by government agencies, financial institutions and major corporations and limits the amount of credit exposure by diversifying its holdings. Inventories Inventories consist of ore stockpiles, concentrates and supplies. Stockpiles Stockpiles consist of coarse ore that has been mined and hoisted from underground or delivered from the open pit that is available for further processing and in-stope ore inventory in the form of drilled and blasted stopes ready to be mucked and hoisted to the surface. The stockpiles are measured by estimating the tonnage, contained ounces (based on assays) and recovery percentages (based on actual recovery rates achieved for processing similar ore). Specific tonnages are verified and compared to original estimates once the stockpile is milled. The ore stockpile is valued at the lower of net realizable value and mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore. The net realizable value of stockpiled ore is assessed by comparing the sum of the carrying value plus future processing and selling costs to the expected revenue to be earned, which is based on the estimated volume and grade of stockpiled material. Mining costs include all costs associated with mining operations and are allocated to each tonne of stockpiled ore. Fully absorbed costs include direct and indirect materials and consumables, direct labour, utilities and amortization of mining assets incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore. Royalty expenses and production taxes are included in production costs, but are not capitalized into inventory. Stockpiles are not intended to be long-term inventory items and are generally processed within twelve months of extraction. The decision to process stockpiled ore is based on a net smelter return analysis. The Company processes its stockpiled ore if its estimated revenue, on a per tonne basis and net of estimated smelting and refining costs, is greater than the related mining and milling costs. The Company has never elected to not process stockpiled ore and does not anticipate departing from this practice in the future. Stockpiled ore on the surface is exposed to the elements, but the Company does not expect its condition to deteriorate significantly as a result. In addition, companies in the mining industry may be required to remove overburden and other mine waste materials to access mineral deposits. During the development of a mine (before production begins), it is generally accepted practise that such costs are capitalized as part of the depreciable cost of building, developing 132 and constructing the mine. The capitalized costs are typically amortized over the productive life of the mine using the units-of-production method. A mining company may continue to remove overburden and waste materials, and therefore incur stripping costs, during the production phase of the mine. In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-6 ("EITF 04-6") which addresses the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine and refers to these costs as variable production costs that should be included as a component of inventory to be recognized in costs applicable to sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory. As a result, capitalization of costs is appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the end of a reporting period. Agnico-Eagle adopted the provisions of EITF 04-6 on January 1, 2006. The impact of adoption was to decrease ore stockpile inventory by $8.4 million and increase future income and mining tax assets by $3.3 million. Adoption of EITF 04-6 had no impact on the Company's cash position or earnings. Concentrates Concentrates inventories consist of concentrates for which legal title has not yet passed to custom smelters. Concentrates inventories are measured based on assays of the processed concentrates and are valued based on the lower of net realizable value and the fully absorbed mining and milling costs associated with extracting and processing the ore. Supplies Supplies, consisting of mine stores inventory, are valued at the lower of average cost and replacement cost. Deferred financing costs Deferred financing costs, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and relate to the issuance of the Company's 4.50% convertible subordinated debentures due February 15, 2012 ("Convertible Debentures") that were fully redeemed by the Company for common shares in February 2007 and the Company's revolving credit facilities, are being amortized to income over the term of the related obligations. When the holders of the Company's Convertible Debentures exercised their conversion option, the common shares issued on such conversion were recorded at an amount equal to the aggregate of the carrying value of the long-term liability, net of the associated financing costs, with no gain or loss being recognized in income. The same principles were applied upon redemption of the Convertible Debentures by the Company. Mining properties, plant and equipment and mine development costs Significant payments related to the acquisition of land and mineral rights are capitalized as mining properties at cost. If a mineable ore body is discovered, such costs are amortized to income when production begins, using the unit-of-production method, based on estimated proven and probable reserves. If no mineable ore body is discovered, such costs are expensed in the period in which it is determined the property has no future economic value. Expenditures for new facilities and improvements that can extend the useful lives of existing facilities are capitalized as plant and equipment at cost. Interest costs incurred for the construction of projects are capitalized. Mine development costs incurred after the commencement of production are capitalized or deferred to the extent that these costs benefit the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access single ore blocks are expensed as incurred; otherwise, such vertical and horizontal developments are classified as mine development costs. Agnico-Eagle records depreciation on both plant and equipment and mine development costs used in commercial production on a unit-of-production basis based on the estimated proven and probable ore reserves of the mine. The unit-of-production method defines the denominator as the total proven and probable tonnes of reserves. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to income as production costs. Assets under construction are not depreciated until the end of the construction period. Upon commencement of commercial production, the capitalized construction costs are transferred to the various categories of plant and equipment. 133 Mineral exploration costs are charged to income in the year in which they are incurred. When it is determined that a mining property can be economically developed as a result of established proven and probable reserves, the costs of further exploration and development to further delineate the ore body on such property are capitalized. The establishment of proven and probable reserves is based on results of final feasibility studies, which indicate whether a property is economically feasible. Upon commencement of the commercial production of a development project, these costs are transferred to the appropriate asset category and are amortized to income using the unit-of-production method mentioned above. Mine development costs, net of salvage values, relating to a property which is abandoned or considered uneconomic for the foreseeable future are written off. The carrying values of mining properties, plant and equipment and mine development costs are reviewed periodically, when impairment factors exist, for possible impairment, based on the future undiscounted net cash flows of the operating mine or development property. If it is determined that the estimated net recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, then a write down to the estimated fair value amount is made with a charge to income. Estimated future cash flows of an operating mine and development properties include estimates of recoverable ounces of gold based on the proven and probable reserves. To the extent economic value exists beyond the proven and probable reserves of an operating mine or development property, this value is included as part of the estimated future cash flows. Estimated future cash flows also involve estimates regarding metal prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production levels, capital and reclamation costs, and related income and mining taxes, all based on detailed engineering life-of-mine plans. Cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties and changes in the estimates of the cash flows may affect the recoverability of long-lived assets. Financial instruments Agnico-Eagle uses derivative financial instruments, primarily option and forward contracts, to manage exposure to fluctuations in metal prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Agnico-Eagle does not hold financial instruments or derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized periodically in the consolidated statement of income or in shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), depending on the nature of the derivative financial instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. Financial instruments designated as hedges are tested for effectiveness on a quarterly basis. Gains and losses on those contracts that are proven to be effective are reported as a component of the related transaction. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized when the following conditions are met: (a)persuasive evidence of an arrangement to purchase exists; (b)the price is determinable; (c)the product has been delivered; and (d)collection of the sales price is reasonably assured. Revenue from gold and silver in the form of dore bars is recorded when the refined gold and silver is sold and delivered to the customer. Generally all the gold and silver in the form of dore bars recovered in the Company's milling process is sold in the period in which it is produced. Under the terms of the Company's concentrate sales contracts with third-party smelters, final prices for the metals contained in the concentrate are set based on the prevailing spot market metal prices on a specified future date based on the date that the concentrate is delivered to the smelter. The Company records revenues under these contracts based on forward prices at the time of delivery, which is when transfer of legal title to concentrate passes to the third-party smelters. The terms of the contracts result in differences between the recorded estimated price at delivery and the final settlement price. These differences are adjusted through revenue at each subsequent financial statement date. 134 Revenues from mining operations consist of gold revenues, net of smelting, refining, transportation and other marketing charges. Revenues from byproduct sales are shown net of smelter charges as part of revenues from mining operations. Foreign currency translation The functional currency for the Company's operations is the US dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities of Agnico-Eagle's operations denominated in a currency other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the year end. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates while revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the year, with the exception of amortization, which is translated at historical exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses are included in income except for gains and losses on foreign currency contracts used to hedge specific future commitments in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on these contracts are accounted for as a component of the related hedged transactions. Reclamation costs On an annual basis, the Company assesses cost estimates and other assumptions used in the valuation of Asset Retirement Obligations ("ARO") at each of its mineral properties to reflect events, changes in circumstances and new information available. Changes in these cost estimates and assumptions have a corresponding impact on the fair value of the ARO. For closed mines, any change in the fair value of AROs results in a corresponding charge or credit within other expense, whereas at operating mines the charge is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the corresponding asset. In 2008, the Company recorded adjustments of $13.6 million for changes in estimates of the AROs at our operating mines. AROs arise from the acquisition, development, construction and normal operation of mining property, plant and equipment, due to government controls and regulations that protect the environment on the closure and reclamation of mining properties. The major parts of the carrying amount of AROs relate to tailings and heap leach pad closure/ rehabilitation; demolition of buildings/mine facilities; ongoing water treatment; and ongoing care and maintenance of closed mines. The fair values of AROs are measured by discounting the expected cash flows using a discount factor that reflects the credit-adjusted risk-free rate of interest. The Company prepares estimates of the timing and amount of expected cash flows when an ARO is incurred. Expected cash flows are updated to reflect changes in facts and circumstances. The principal factors that can cause expected cash flows to change are: the construction of new processing facilities; changes in the quantities of material in reserves and a corresponding change in the life of mine plan; changing ore characteristics that impact required environmental protection measures and related costs; changes in water quality that impact the extent of water treatment required; and changes in laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. When expected cash flows increase, the revised cash flows are discounted using a current discount factor whereas when expected cash flows decrease the reduced cash flows are discounted using the historical discount factor used in the original estimation of the expected cash flows, and then in both cases any change in the fair value of the ARO is recorded. Agnico-Eagle records the fair value of an ARO when it is incurred. AROs are adjusted to reflect the passage of time (accretion) calculated by applying the discount factor implicit in the initial fair value measurement to the beginning-of-period carrying amount of the AROs. For producing mines, accretion expense is recorded in the cost of goods sold each period. Upon settlement of an ARO, Agnico-Eagle records a gain or loss if the actual cost differs from the carrying amount of the ARO. Settlement gains/losses are recorded in other (income) expense. Other environmental remediation costs that are not AROs as defined by FAS 143 are expensed as incurred. Income and mining taxes Agnico-Eagle follows the liability method of tax allocation for accounting for income taxes. Under this method of tax allocation, future income and mining tax bases of assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, or FIN 48. FIN 48 requires the recognition of the effect of uncertain tax positions where it is more 135 likely than not based on technical merits that the position would be sustained. The Company recognizes the amount of the tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. It further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in the year of such change. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense in the current year. The impact of the adoption of FIN 48 was to increase the Company's future income tax liability by $4.5 million. Stock-based compensation Agnico-Eagle has two stock-based compensation plans. The Employee Stock Option Plan is described in note 7(a) and the Employee Share Purchase Plan is described in note 7(b) to the consolidated financial statements. In 2003, the Company prospectively adopted FAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" as amended by FAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure". These accounting standards recommend the expensing of stock option grants after January 1, 2003. The standards recommend that the fair value of stock options be recognized in income over the applicable vesting period as a compensation expense. The Company's Employee Stock Option Plan provides for the granting of options to directors, officers, employees and service providers to purchase common shares. Share options have exercise prices equal to market price at the grant date or over the term of the applicable vesting period depending on the terms of the option agreements. The fair value of these stock options is recognized in the consolidated statement of income or in the consolidated balance sheet if capitalized as part of property, plant and mine development over the applicable vesting period as a compensation cost. Any consideration paid by employees on exercise of stock options or purchase of stock is credited to share capital. Fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which requires the Company to estimate the expected volatility of the Company's share price and the expected life of the stock options. Limitations with existing option valuation models and the inherent difficulties associated with estimating these variables create difficulties in determining a reliable single measure of the fair value of stock option grants. The dilutive impact of stock option grants is factored into the Company's reported diluted income (loss) per share. Income per share Basic income per share is calculated on net income for the year using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. For years in which the Convertible Debentures were outstanding, diluted income per share was calculated on the weighted average number of common shares that would have been outstanding during such year had all Convertible Debentures been converted at the beginning of the year into common shares, if such conversions were dilutive. In addition, the weighted average number of common shares used to determine diluted income per share includes an adjustment for stock options outstanding and warrants outstanding using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method: the exercise of options or warrants is assumed to be at the beginning of the period (or date of issuance, if later); the proceeds from the exercise of options or warrants, plus in the case of options the future period compensation expense on options granted on or after January 1, 2003, are assumed to be used to purchase common shares at the average market price during the period; and the incremental number of common shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased) is included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share computation. Pension costs and obligations and post-retirement benefits Prior to July 1, 1997, Agnico-Eagle had a defined benefit plan for its salaried employees, which was substantially converted to a defined contribution plan. In addition, Agnico-Eagle provides a non-registered supplementary executive retirement defined benefit plan for its senior officers. The executive retirement plan 136 benefits are generally based on the employees' years of service and level of compensation. Pension expense related to the defined benefit plan is the net of the cost of benefits provided, the interest cost of projected benefits, return on plan assets and amortization of experience gains and losses. Pension fund assets are measured at current fair values. Actuarially determined plan surpluses or deficits, experience gains or losses and the cost of pension plan improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected average remaining service life of the employee group. Agnico-Eagle maintains a defined contribution plan covering all of its employees. The plan is funded by Company contributions based on a percentage of income for services rendered by employees. The Company does not offer any other post-retirement benefits to its employees. As of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" ("FAS 158"). FAS 158 required employers that sponsor one or more defined benefit plans to (i) recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in its statement of financial position, (ii) recognize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, (iii) measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer's fiscal year-end statement of financial position, and (iv) disclose in the notes to the financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The impact of adopting FAS 158 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows: As at December 31, 2006 Before Application of FAS 158 Adjustment After Application of FAS 158 Reclamation provision and other liabilities $ 26,051 $ 1,406 $ 27,457 Deferred income tax liability $ 170,087 $ (396 ) $ 169,691 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (16,989 ) $ (1,010 ) $ (17,999 ) Total shareholders' equity $ 1,253,415 $ (1,010 ) $ 1,252,405 Commercial Production The Company assesses each mine construction project to determine when a mine moves into production stage. The criteria used to assess the start date are determined based on the nature of each mine construction project, such as the complexity of a plant and its location. The Company considers various relevant criteria to assess when the mine is substantially complete and ready for its intended use and moved into production stage. The criteria considered include: (1) completion of a reasonable period of testing of mine plant and equipment; (2) ability to produce minerals in saleable form (within specifications); and (3) ability to sustain ongoing production of minerals. When a mine construction project moves into the production stage, the capitalization of certain mine construction costs ceases and costs are either capitalized to inventory or expensed, except for sustaining capital costs related to property, plant and equipment and underground mine development or reserve development. Stripping Costs Pre-production stripping costs are capitalized until an "other than de minimis" level of mineral is produced, after which time such costs are either capitalized to inventory or expensed. The Company considers various relevant criteria to assess when an "other than de minimis" level of mineral is produced. The criteria considered include: (1) the number of ounces mined compared to total ounces in reserves; (2) the quantity of ore mined compared to the total quantity of ore expected to be mined over the life of the mine; (3) the current stripping ratio compared to the expected stripping ratio over the life of the mine; and (4) the ore grade compared to the expected ore grade over the life of the mine. Other Accounting Developments Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands required 137 disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of FAS 157 were adopted January 1, 2008. In February 2008, FASB staff issued Staff Position No. 157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157" ("FSP FAS 157-2"). FSP FAS 157-2 delayed the effective date of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The provisions of FSP FAS 157-2 are effective for the Company fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. Fair value is the value at which a financial instrument could be closed out or sold in a transaction with a willing and knowledgeable counterparty over a period of time consistent with the Company's investment strategy. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, where available. If market quotes are not available, fair value is based on internally developed models that use market-based or independent information as inputs. These models could produce a fair value that may not be reflective of future fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FAS 157 are: Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; Level 2  Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and Level 3  Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity). The following table sets out the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value within the fair value hierarchy. Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents(1) 99,381 94,664 4,717  Accounts receivable(1) 45,640  45,640  Available-for-sale securities(2) 70,383 70,383   215,404 165,047 50,357  Financial liabilities: Accounts payable(1) 139,795  139,795  Bank debt(3) 200,146  200,146  Derivative liabilities(4) 12,823  12,823  352,764  352,764  (1)Fair value approximates the carrying amounts due to the short-term nature. (2)Recorded at fair value using quoted market prices. (3)Recorded at cost. This line item also includes accrued interest. (4)Recorded at fair value based on broker-dealer quotations. Cash equivalents are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are held to maturity and valued using interest rates observable at commonly quoted intervals. Cash equivalents are market securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. The Company's available-for-sale equity securities are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and as such are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of these securities are calculated as the quoted market price of the security multiplied by the quantity of shares held by the Company. In the event that a decline in the fair value of an investment occurs and the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income and a new cost basis for the investment is established. The Company assesses whether a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary by considering available evidence, including changes in general market conditions, specific industry and individual company data, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the individual investment. New evidence could 138 become available in future periods which would affect this assessment and thus could result in material impairment charges with respect to those investments for which the cost basis exceeds its fair value. In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" ("FAS 159"). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with the objective of improving financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The provisions of FAS 159 were adopted January 1, 2008. The Company did not elect the Fair Value Option for any additional items. In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force (the "EITF") reached consensus on Issue No. 06-11, "Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards" ("EITF 06-11") EITF 06-11 requires that the tax benefit related to dividend and dividend equivalents paid on equity-classifed nonvested shares and nonvested share units, which are expected to vest, be recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends declared in the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. The adoption of this statement does not currently have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Developments Under the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 74, the Company is required to disclose information related to new accounting standards that have not yet been adopted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of these statements will have on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures. In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160, "Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements" ("FAS 160"). FAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for entities that have equity investments that are not attributable directly to the parent, called non-controlling interests or minority interests. Specifically, FAS 160 states where and how to report non-controlling interests in the consolidated statements of financial position and operations, how to account for changes in non-controlling interests and provides disclosure requirements. The provisions of FAS 160 are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" ("FAS 141(R)"). FAS 141(R) establishes how an entity accounts for the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests acquired, how to account for goodwill acquired and determines what disclosures are required as part of a business combination. FAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, early adoption is prohibited. In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS 161"). This statement requires entities to provide greater transparency about: (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS 133"), and its related interpretations, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim period beginning after November, 15 2008. Comparative disclosures for earlier periods are not required. In 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 08-3, "Accounting by Lessees for Maintenance Deposits under Lease Agreements" ("EITF 08-3"). EITF 08-3 requires that maintenance deposits should be considered a deposit when paid to the lessor if it is probable (as defined in FASB Concept Statement No. 6) that the deposits will be refunded to the lessee. The cost of maintenance activities should be expensed or capitalized by the lessee, as appropriate, when the underlying maintenance is performed. If it is determined that a maintenance deposit is unlikely to be refunded to the lessee, the deposit is recognized as additional rent expense. If it is probable at inception of the lease that a portion of the deposits will not be refunded, the lessee should recognize as expense a pro rata portion of the deposits as they are paid. The issue is effective for fiscal years beginning after December, 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is not permitted. 139 In May 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. APB 14-1, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)" ("FSP APB 14-1"). FSP APB 14-1 applies to convertible debt instruments that, by their stated terms, may be settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion, including partial cash settlement, unless the embedded conversion option is required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under FAS 133. Convertible debt instruments within the scope of FSP APB 14-1 are not addressed by the existing APB 14. FSP APB 14-1 requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments within the scope of FSP APB 14-1 be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the entity's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. This requires an allocation of the convertible debt proceeds between the liability component and the embedded conversion option (i.e., the equity component). The difference between the principal amount of the debt and the amount of the proceeds allocated to the liability component will be reported as a debt discount and subsequently amortized to earnings over the instrument's expected life using the effective interest method. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. In June 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 07-5, "Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity's Own Stock" ("EITF 07-5"). EITF 07-5 clarifies the determination of whether an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an entity's own stock, which would qualify as a scope exception under FAS 133. EITF 07-5 is effective for the Company's fiscal years beginning January 1, 2009. Early adoption for an existing instrument is not permitted. In November 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 08-6, "Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations" ("EITF 08-6"), in which the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations involving equity method investments were clarified. The intent of EITF 08-6 is to provide guidance on (i) determining the initial carrying value of an equity method investment, (ii) performing an impairment assessment of an underlying indefinite-lived intangible asset of an equity method investment, (iii) accounting for an equity method investee's issuance of shares, and (iv) accounting for a change in an investment from the equity method to the cost method. EITF 08-6 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and is to be applied prospectively. In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 132(R)-1, "Employers' Disclosures about Post  Retirement Benefit Plan Assets" ("FSP FAS 132(R)-1"), which amends FASB Statement No. 132 "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits" ("FAS 132"), to provide guidance on an employer's disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The objective of FSP FAS 132(R)-1 is to require more detailed disclosures about employers' plan assets, including employers' investment strategies, major categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. FSP FAS 132(R)-1 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. Upon initial application, the provisions of this FSP are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes. Based on recent announcements from the Canadian Securities Administrators and the Securities Exchange Commission, it is currently anticipated that as a Canadian issuer and existing US GAAP filer, the earliest date at which the Company will be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as its principal basis of accounting is for the year ending December 31, 2014. Therefore, financial statement comparative figures prepared under IFRS would be required for fiscal year 2013. The Company has initiated the work with transition to IFRS. A project organization with a project group and a steering committee has been established and a high level project plan has been formulated. The implementation of IFRS will be done through three distinct phases: (i) diagnostics, (ii) detailed IFRS analysis and conversion, and (iii) implement IFRS in daily business. Phase (i) has been completed and the start of phase (ii) will be decided in mid-2009. As a result of phase (i), a diagnostics report has been finalized with the primary objective to understand, identify and assess the overall effort required by the Company to produce financial information in accordance with the IFRS. The key areas for the diagnostics work was to review the 2007 consolidated financial statements of the Company and get a detailed understanding of the differences between IFRS and US GAAP to be able to identify potential system and process changes required as a result of converting to IFRS. The key issues found during the diagnostics were (i) first-time adoption of IFRS, (ii) property, plant and equipment, (iii) decommissioning and reclamation liabilities, (iv) impairment, (v) reserves and resources, and (vi) foreign currency translation. Comparative figures Certain items in the comparative consolidated financial statements have been reclassified from statements previously presented to conform to the presentation of the 2008 consolidated financial statements. 140 AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (thousands of United States dollars, US GAAP basis) As at December 31, 2008 2007 ASSETS Current Cash and

The unamortized capitalized cost for computer software at the end of 2008 was $5.6 million (2007  $5.4 million). The Company has made leasehold improvements amounting to $3.3 million, which is being amortized straight-line over the life of the lease plus one renewal period. 146 AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated) December 31, 2008 4. BANK DEBT The Company entered into a credit agreement on January 10, 2008 with a group of financial institutions relating to a new $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "First Credit Facility"); the Company's previous $300 million secured revolving credit facility was terminated. The First Credit Facility matures on January 10, 2013, however, the Company, with the consent of lenders representing 662/3% of the aggregate commitments under the facility, has the option to extend the term of this facility for additional one-year terms. On September 4, 2008, the Company entered into a further credit agreement with a separate group of financial institutions relating to an additional $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Second Credit Facility" and together with the First Credit Facility, the "Credit Facilities"). The Second Credit Facility matures on September 4, 2010. Payment and performance of the Company's obligations under each of the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain material subsidiaries of the Company. The restrictive covenants and events of default under each of the Credit Facilities are identical. Each of the Credit Facilities contains covenants that restrict, among other things, the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, make distributions in certain circumstances, sell material assets and carry on a business other than a mining business. The Company is also required to maintain certain financial ratios as well as a minimum tangible net worth. In addition, each of the Credit Facilities requires the Company to utilize funds available under the Credit Facilities on a pro rata basis, subject to a permitted utilization differential threshold and exclusion of advances under the First Credit Facility that are letters of credit or swing line advances. At December 31, 2008, the Credit Facilities were drawn down by $200 million. These drawdowns, together with outstanding letters of credit under the First Credit Facility, decrease the amounts available under the Credit Facilities such that $343 million was available for future drawdowns at December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, interest expense was $3.0 million (2007  $3.3 million; 2006  $2.9 million) and cash interest payments were $6.3 million (2007  $2.4 million; 2006  $4.2 million). In 2008, cash interest on the Credit Facilities was $4.6 million (2007  nil; 2006  nil) and cash standby fees on the Credit Facilities were $1.2 million (2007  $2.3 million; 2006  $1.3 million). In 2008, $4.6 million (2007  nil; 2006  $0.3 million) of the interest expense was capitalized to construction in progress. The Company's weighted average interest rate on all of its bank debt as at December 31, 2008 was 3.77% (2007  n/a; 2006  n/a). 5. RECLAMATION PROVISION AND OTHER LIABILITIES Reclamation provision and other liabilities consist of the following: 2008 2007 Reclamation and closure costs (note 5(a)) $ 52,125 $ 44,690 Goldex Mine government grant (note 5(b)) 2,413  Pension benefits (note 5(c)) 5,153 6,786 Long-term portion of capital lease obligations (note 13) 12,079 6,465 $ 71,770 $ 57,941 (a)Reclamation and closure costs Reclamation estimates are based on current legislation, third party estimates and feasibility study calculations. All of the accrued reclamation and closure costs are long-term in nature and thus no portion of these costs has been reclassified to current liabilities. The Company does not currently have assets that are restricted for the purposes of settling these obligations. The following table reconciles the beginning and ending carrying amounts of the asset retirement obligations. 2008 2007 Asset retirement obligations, beginning of year $ 44,690 $ 22,073 Current year additions and changes in estimate 13,698 17,829 Current year accretion 1,363 1,319 Foreign exchange revaluation (7,626 ) 3,469 Asset retirement obligations, end of year $ 52,125 $ 44,690 147 AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated) December 31, 2008 5. RECLAMATION PROVISION AND OTHER LIABILITIES (Continued) The Company made a change in its accounting estimate with regard to reclamation and closure costs driven primarily by an increase in the estimated input costs. The change in estimate has not had an impact on the current year's consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income but has had an impact on the consolidated balance sheet as the current year's revisions have increased the asset retirement obligation and have also increased the Company's costs for property, plant and mine development. The increase of costs for property, plant and mine development will have an impact on the Company's statements of income and comprehensive income in future periods through increased accretion expense and amortization expense. (b)Goldex Mine grant The Company has received funds (the "grant") from the Quebec government in respect of the construction of the Goldex Mine. The Company has agreed to repay a portion of the grant to the Quebec government, to a maximum amount of 50% of the grant. The repayment amount is calculated and paid annually for fiscal years 2010, 2011 and 2012 if the agreed criteria are met. For each of these three years, if the yearly average gold price is higher than $620 per ounce, 50% of one third of the grant must be repaid. The Company believes the gold price will be higher than $620 per ounce during the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 and that the criteria for recognition of a loss contingency accrual in accordance with FAS 5 has been met. (c)Pension benefits Effective July 1, 1997, Agnico-Eagle's defined benefit pension plan for active employees (the "Employees Plan") was converted to a defined contribution plan. Employees who retired prior to that date remain in the Employees Plan. In addition, Agnico-Eagle provides a non-registered executive supplementary defined benefit plan for certain senior officers (the "Executives Plan"). The funded status of the Executives Plan is based on actuarial valuations as of July 1, 2008 and projected to December 31, 2008. The funded status of the Employees Plan in 2007 was based on an actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2006 and projected to December 31, 2007. During 2008 however, the Employees Plan was closed as a result of annuities having been purchased for all remaining members. Recognition of the settlement has been reflected in the 2008 net periodic pensions cost. The components of Agnico-Eagle's net pension plan expense are as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Service cost  benefits earned during the year $ 452 $ 429 $ 399 (Gain) loss due to settlement 761  (16 ) Prior service cost 24 24 23 Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 549 466 384 Return on plan assets (156 ) (171 ) (166 ) Amortization of net transition asset, past service liability and net experience gains (11 ) (25 ) (22 ) Net pension plan expense $ 1,619 $ 723 $ 602 Assets for the Executives Plan consist of deposits on hand with regulatory authorities which are refundable when benefit payments are made or on the ultimate wind-up of the plan. The accumulated benefit obligation for this plan at December 31, 2008 was $4.5 million (2007  $6.8 million). At the end of 2008, the remaining unamortized net transition obligation was $0.8 million (2007  $1.0 million) for the Executives Plan and the net transition asset was $0.1 million (2007  $0.2 million) for the Employees Plan. The following table provides the net amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31: Pension Benefits 2008 Pension Benefits 2007 Employees Executives Employees Executives Liability (asset) $ (110 ) $  $ (495 ) $  Accrued employee benefit liability  4,895  5,624 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss): Initial transition obligation (asset)  830 (186 ) 1,017 Past service liability  126  140 Net experience (gains) losses  (1,356 ) 446 5 Net liability (asset) $ (110 ) $ 4,495 $ (235 ) $ 6,786 148 AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated) December 31, 2008 5.

RECLAMATION PROVISION AND OTHER LIABILITIES (Continued) The estimated benefits to be paid from each plan in the next ten years are presented below. As the Employees Plan was settled in 2008, no benefits are payable: Executives 2009 $ 109 2010 $ 109 2011 $ 109 2012 $ 364 2013 $ 415 2014 - 2018 $ 2,074 In addition to the Employees Plan and the Executives Plan, the Company has two defined contribution pension plans. Under the basic plan (the "Basic Plan"), Agnico-Eagle contributes 5% of each employee's base employment compensation to a defined contribution plan. The expense in 2008 was $5.3 million (2007  $4.3 million; 2006  $3.0 million). In addition to the Basic Plan, effective January 1, 2008 the Company adopted the supplemental plan for designated executives at the level of Vice-President or above. Under this plan, an additional 10% of the designated executives earnings for the year (including salary and short-term bonus) is contributed by the Company. In 2008, $0.7 million was contributed to the supplemental plan. 6. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (a)Common shares In 2008, the Company declared dividends on its common shares of $0.18 per share (2007  $0.18 per share; 2006  $0.12 per share). (b)Flow-through common share private placements In 2008, Agnico-Eagle issued 779,250 (2007  nil; 2006  1,226,000) common shares under flow-through share private placements for total proceeds of $43.5 million (2007  nil; 2006  $35.3 million), net of share issue costs. Effective December 31, 2008, the Company renounced to its investors C$54.5 million (2007  C$10.1; 2006  C$40.2 million) of such expenses for income tax purposes. The Company has an obligation to incur $31 million in exploration expenditures related to the expenditures previously renounced. The difference between the flow-through share issuance price and the market price of Agnico-Eagle's shares at the time of purchase is recorded as a liability at the time the flow-through shares are issued. This liability terminates when the exploration expenditures are renounced to investors. The difference between the flow-through share issuance price and market price reduces the future tax expense charged to income as this difference represents proceeds received by the Company for the sale of future tax deductions to investors in the flow-through shares. Subsequent to period-end, the Company issued 183,900 common shares under flow-through share private placements for total proceeds of C$16.6 million. The Company has an obligation to incur C$16.6 million in exploration expenditures and to renounce such expenditures to the investors of these flow-through shares. (c)Private placement of units On December 3, 2008, the Company closed a private placement of 9.2 million units. Each unit consists of one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share of the Company at a price of $47.25 per share at any time during the five-year term of the warrant. As consideration for the lead purchaser's commitment, the Company issued to the lead purchaser an additional 4 million warrants. The net proceeds of the private placement were approximately $281 million, after deducting share issue costs of $8.8 million. If all outstanding warrants are exercised, the Company would issue an additional 8.6 million common shares. (d)Public offering of common shares In December 2008, the Company issued 900,000 shares at a price of $38 per share under a prospectus supplement to its base shelf prospectus to fund a purchase of surface rights and advance royalty payments in connection with the development of the Pinos Altos property. The net proceeds of the issuance were approximately $34.2 million. 150 AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated) December 31, 2008 6. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (Continued) (e)Public offering of units In 2002, Agnico-Eagle issued 6.9 million units. Each unit consisted one common share and one half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant entitled the holder to purchase one common share at a price of $19.00. During 2007, 6,873,190 warrants were exercised (2006  4,000). The warrants were exercisable at any time prior to November 14, 2007, at which time 22,810 warrants expired. (f)Accumulated other comprehensive loss The opening balance of the cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2008 and 2007 of $(15.9) million resulted from Agnico-Eagle adopting the US dollar as its principal currency of measurement. Prior to this change, the Canadian dollar had been used as the reporting currency. Prior periods' consolidated financial statements were translated into US dollars by the current rate method using the year end or the annual average exchange rate where appropriate. This translation approach was applied from January 1, 1994. This translation gave rise to a deficit in the cumulative translation adjustment account within accumulated other comprehensive loss as at December 31, 2008 and 2007. The Company has designated certain foreign exchange derivative contracts as cash flow hedges and, as such, unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The following table sets out the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of related tax effects: 2008 2007 Cumulative translation adjustment from adopting US dollar as principal reporting currency $ (15,907 ) $ (15,907 ) Unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities 1,602 (6,484 ) Unrealized loss on hedging activities (8,888 )  Cumulative translation adjustments (299 ) (299 ) Unrealized gain (loss) on pension liability 400 (1,422 ) Tax effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss items 2,484 400 $ (20,608 ) $ (23,712 ) In 2008, no amounts (2007  $1.7 million loss) were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income to reflect the amortization of gold put option contract premiums for contracts originally scheduled to mature in 2007. In 2008, a $9.0 million gain (2007  $1.9 million gain, 2006  $16.6 million gain) was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income to reflect the realization of gains on available-for-sale securities due to the disposition of those securities. (g)Net income per share The following table provides the weighted average number of common shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted income per share: 2008 2007 2006 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding  basic 144,740,658 132,768,049 115,461,046 Add: Dilutive impact of employee stock options 1,148,070 1,189,820 786,358 Dilutive impact of warrants   2,862,891 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding  diluted 145,888,728 133,957,869 119,110,295 The calculation of diluted income per share has been computed using the treasury stock method. In applying the treasury stock method, options and warrants with an exercise price greater than the average quoted market price, for the period outstanding, of the common shares are not included in the calculation of diluted income per share as the effect is anti-dilutive. 7. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (a)Employee Stock Option Plan ("ESOP") The Company's ESOP provides for the granting of options to directors, officers, employees and service providers to purchase common shares. Under this plan, options are granted at the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The 151 AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated) December 31, 2008 7. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued) number of shares subject to option for any one person may not exceed 5% of the Company's common shares issued and outstanding at the date of grant. Up to May 31, 2001, the number of common shares reserved for issuance under the ESOP was 6,000,000 and options granted under the ESOP had a maximum term of ten years. On April 24, 2001, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors adopted a policy pursuant to which options granted after that date shall have a maximum term of five years. In 2001, the shareholders approved a resolution to increase the number of common shares reserved for issuance under the ESOP by 2,000,000 to 8,000,000. In 2004 and 2006, the shareholders approved a further 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 common shares for issuance under the ESOP, respectively. In 2008, the shareholders approved a further 6,000,000 common shares for issuance under the ESOP. Of the 2,549,400 options granted under the ESOP in 2008, 637,350 options granted vested immediately and expire in 2013. The remaining options expire in 2013 and vest in equal installments, on each anniversary date of the grant, over a three-year period. Of the 1,380,000 options granted under the ESOP in 2007, 345,000 options granted vested immediately and expire in 2012. The remaining options expire in 2012 and vest in equal installments, on each anniversary date of the grant, over a three-year period. As a result of the acquisition of Cumberland Resources Ltd. ("Cumberland"), 326,250 options in Cumberland were converted to options of the Company. All these options vested immediately. Of the 1,232,000 options granted under the ESOP in 2006, 308,000 options granted vested immediately and expire in 2011. The remaining options expire in 2011 and vest in equal installments, on each anniversary date of the grant, over a three-year period.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued) The number of un-optioned shares available for granting of options as at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 6,349,250, 2,832,250 and 4,212,250, respectively. On January 2, 2009, 2,251,000 options were granted under the ESOP, of which 562,750 options vested immediately and expire in the year 2014. The remaining options expire in 2014 and vest in equal installments on each anniversary date of the grant, over a three-year period. Agnico-Eagle estimated the fair value of options under the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions: 2008 2007 2006 Risk-free interest rate 3.65% 4.02% 3.91% Expected life of options (in years) 2.5 2.5 2.5 Expected volatility of Agnico-Eagle's share price 44.8% 37.6% 48.7% Expected dividend yield 0.23% 0.29% 0.12% The Company uses historical volatility in estimating the expected volatility of Agnico-Eagle's share price. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding at December 31, 2008 was C$86.5 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercisable at December 31, 2008 was C$48.2 million. The total compensation cost for the ESOP recognized in the consolidated statements of income for the current year was $25.3 million (2007  $9.8 million; 2006  $5.2 million). The total compensation cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was $25.2 million as of December 31, 2008. Of the total compensation cost for the ESOP, $9 million was capitalized as part of construction cost in 2008 (2007  nil; 2006  nil). (b)Incentive Share Purchase Plan On June 26, 1997, the shareholders approved an Incentive Share Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan") to encourage directors, officers and employees ("Participants") to purchase Agnico-Eagle's common shares at market values. Under the Purchase Plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their basic annual salaries and directors may contribute up to 100% of their annual board and committee retainer fees. For both employees and directors, Agnico-Eagle contributes an amount equal to 50% of each Participant's contribution. In 2008, 154,998 common shares were subscribed for under the Purchase Plan (2007  167,378; 2006  146,249) for proceeds of $9.5 million (2007  $7.1 million; 2006  $4.7 million). As at December 31, 2008, 45,181 shares subscribed for in 2008 were not issued. In May 2008, shareholders approved an increase in the maximum amount of shares reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan to 5,000,000 from 2,500,000. As at December 31, 2008, Agnico-Eagle has reserved for issuance 2,937,153 common shares (2007  592,151; 2006  759,529) under the Purchase Plan. 8. INCOME AND MINING TAXES Income and mining taxes recovery is made up of the following geographic components: 2008 2007 2006 Current provision Canada $ 6,143 $ 3,272 $ 20,266 Future provision (recovery) Canada 25,580 20,363 69,645 Finland (8,899 ) (3,702 ) 11,522 Other   (2,127 ) $ 22,824 $ 19,933 $ 99,306 Cash income and mining taxes paid in 2008 were $3.8 million (2007  $22.1 million; 2006  $1.4 million). 153 AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated) December 31, 2008 8. INCOME AND MINING TAXES (Continued) The income and mining taxes recovery is different from the amount that would have been computed by applying the Canadian statutory income tax rate as a result of the following: 2008 2007 2006 Combined federal and composite provincial tax rates 31.1% 32.6% 34.6% Increase (decrease) in taxes resulting from: Provincial mining duties 6.9 12.3 12.3 Resource allowances   (3.5 ) Impact of foreign tax rates  (2.3 ) 1.1 Permanent differences (13.4 ) (0.9 ) 0.8 Valuation allowance 5.8  (4.5 ) Effect of changes in income tax rates (6.6 ) (29.2 ) (2.7 ) Actual rate as a percentage of pre-tax income 23.8% 12.5% 38.1% As at December 31, 2008 and 2007, Agnico-Eagle's future income and mining tax assets and liabilities were as follows: 2008 2007 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Mining properties $  $ 471,553 $  $ 565,613 Net operating and capital loss carry-forwards 21,647 (14,906 ) 17,805  Mining duties  (38,669 )  (55,998 ) Reclamation provisions  (22,892 )  (25,499 ) Valuation allowance  8,330 (11,900 )  Future income and mining tax assets and liabilities $ 21,647 $ 403,416 $ 5,905 $ 484,116 All of Agnico-Eagle's future income tax assets and liabilities are denominated in local currency based on the jurisdiction in which the Company pays taxes and are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the consolidated balance sheet dates. The decrease in future tax liabilities was due in part to the stronger US dollar in relation to the Canadian dollar and the Swedish krona throughout 2008. At December 31, 2008, asset and liability amounts were translated into US dollars at an exchange rate of C$1.2240 per $1.00, and at an exchange rate of SEK 7.8770 per $1.00, whereas at December 31, 2007, asset and liability amounts were translated at an exchange rate of C$0.9881 per $1.00, and at an exchange rate of SEK 6.4568 per $1.00. The Company operates in different jurisdictions and accordingly it is subject to income and other taxes under the various tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. The tax rules and regulations in many countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. The Company may be subject in the future to a review of its historic income and other tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain tax rules and regulations to the Company's business conducted within the country involved. The Company adopted the provision of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company reported a $4,487 reduction to the January 1, 2007, balance of retained earnings. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Balance at January 1, 2007 $ 4,487 Reductions for foreign exchange (1,097 ) Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 3,390 Reductions for foreign exchange (566 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 2,824 The full amount of unrecognized tax benefits of $2,824, if recognized, would reduce the Company's annual effective tax rate. The Company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. 154 AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated) December 31, 2008 8. INCOME AND MINING TAXES (Continued) The Company is subject to taxes in the following significant jurisdictions: Canada, Mexico, Sweden and Finland, each with varying statutes of limitations. The 1998 through 2008 tax years generally remain subject to examination. On November 10, 2008, the Canadian Department of Finance released draft legislation amending section 261 of the Income Tax Act (Canada), which provides new tax calculating currency rules that taxpayers must use when determining their Canadian tax results. These new currency rules allow the Company to prepare its corporate tax return using US dollars instead of translating the annual activity into Canadian dollars. As of December 31, 2008, the draft legislation has not been finalized; however, the Company expects this legislation to be effective for its 2008 tax returns. Management is currently assessing the impact of this legislation on the Company. 9. ACQUISITIONS (a)Pinos Altos Project In March 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with Industrias Penoles S.A. de C.V. ("Penoles") to acquire the Pinos Altos project in Chihuahua, Mexico. The Pinos Altos project is located in the Sierra Madre gold belt, 225 kilometres west of the city of Chihuahua. Under the terms of the agreement, Agnico-Eagle had the option to purchase the Pinos Altos project for cash and share consideration. In March 2006, Agnico-Eagle paid Penoles $32.5 million in cash and issued 2,063,635 common shares to Penoles to obtain 100% ownership of the Pinos Altos project. In addition, the Company incurred $0.2 million in transaction costs associated with the property acquisition. The allocation of the total purchase price to the fair values of assets acquired is set out in the table below: Total Purchase Price: Purchase price $ 66,809 Transaction costs 167 Total purchase price to allocate $ 66,976 Fair Value of Assets Acquired: Pinos Altos mining property $ 66,976 (b)Cumberland Resources Ltd. On February 14, 2007, the Company and Agnico-Eagle Acquisition Corporation ("Agnico Acquisition"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, signed an agreement with Cumberland under which the Company and Agnico Acquisition agreed to make an exchange offer (the "Offer") for all of the outstanding common shares of Cumberland not already owned by the Company. At the time, the Company owned 2,037,000 or 2.6% of the outstanding shares of Cumberland on a fully diluted basis. Under the terms of the Offer, each Cumberland share was to be exchanged for 0.185 common shares of Agnico-Eagle. At the time, Cumberland owned 100% of the Meadowbank gold project, located in Nunavut, Canada. As of July 9, 2007, all common shares of Cumberland were acquired pursuant to the Offer. As of July 9, 2007, a total of 13,768,510 of the Company's shares were issued for the acquisition resulting in an increase of $536.6 million in common shares issued. The total purchase price as of July 9, 2007 amounted to $577.0 million which was allocated to various balance sheet accounts, mainly mining properties. On August 1, 2007, Agnico Acquisition, Cumberland and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cumberland were amalgamated with Agnico-Eagle. The results of operations of Cumberland are included in the income statement for the combined entity from April 17, 2007. The purchase price paid through the issuance of 13,768,510 shares of the Company is summarized as follows. Shares Issued Total Issuance of the Company's Shares for Cumberland Acquisition: April 16, 2007 11,610,074 April 30, 2007 932,958 July 9, 2007 1,225,478 Total shares issued 13,768,510 155 AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated) December 31, 2008 9. ACQUISITIONS (Continued) In addition, the Company entered into a series of gold derivative transactions in connection with the take-over bid for Cumberland in February 2007. Prior to announcement of the take-over bid by Agnico-Eagle, Cumberland secured a gold loan facility for up to 420,000 ounces. As part of the condition of the gold loan, Cumberland entered into a series of derivative transactions to secure a minimum monetized value for the gold that was expected to be received under the gold loan. Cumberland entered into a zero-cost collar whereby a gold put option was bought with a strike price of C$605 per ounce. The cost of the put option was financed by the sale of a gold call option with a strike price of $800 per ounce. Both of Cumberland's derivative positions were for 420,000 ounces of gold and matured on September 20, 2007, the expected drawdown date of the loan. As Agnico-Eagle's policy is to not sell forward gold production, Agnico-Eagle entered into a series of transactions to neutralize Cumberland's derivative position. Accordingly, Agnico-Eagle purchased call options and sold put options with the exact same size, strike price and maturity as Cumberland's derivative position for $15.9 million. All derivative positions were closed out in late June 2007. During 2008 certain tax assets that were not recognized upon the acquisition of Cumberland Resources Limited in 2007 were determined to be more likely than not to be realized. This resulted in a decrease to mineral properties and the future tax liability of $15 million. The allocation of the total purchase price for the 100% of Cumberland interest owned by the Company to the fair values of assets acquired is set forth in the table below: Total Purchase Price: Purchase price $ 536,556 Share of Cumberland previously acquired for cash 9,637 Fair value of options and warrants acquired 18,956 Transaction costs 11,836 Total purchase price to allocate $ 576,985 Fair Value of Assets Acquired: Net working capital acquired (including cash of $96,043) $ 81,704 Plant and equipment 40,238 Other net liabilities (1,399 ) Mining properties 736,197 Future income tax liability (279,755 ) Total purchase price $ 576,985 10. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES 2008 2007 Trade payables $ 68,571 $ 58,438 Wages payable 6,484 7,043 Accrued liabilities 32,991 33,040 Current portion of capital lease obligations 9,878 9,706 Other liabilities 21,871  $ 139,795 $ 108,227 Other liabilities mainly consists of the liability portion of the flow-through shares issuance of $17.5 million (note 6(b)). 11. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS As at December 31, 2008, the total indebtedness of Contact Diamond Corporation ("Contact") to the Company was nil (2007  nil, 2006  $3.5 million) including accrued interest to December 31, 2008 of nil (2007  nil, 2006  $0.1 million). Contact was a consolidated entity of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2002. As of August 2003, the Company ceased consolidating Contact as the Company's investment no longer represented a "controlling financial interest". The loan was originally advanced for the purpose of funding ongoing exploration and operating activities. The loan was repayable on demand with a rate of interest on the loan of 8% per annum. The Company, however, waived the interest on this loan commencing May 13, 2002. 156 AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated) December 31, 2008 11. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (Continued) In 2006, the Company tendered its 13.8 million Contact shares in conjunction with Stornoway Diamond Corporation's ("Stornoway") offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Contact. Under the terms of the offer, each share of Contact was exchanged for 0.36 of a Stornoway share resulting in the receipt by the Company of 4,968,747 Stornoway shares. A $4.4 million gain on the exchange of shares was recognized and a gain of $2.9 million was recognized on the write-up of the loan to Contact during 2006. In addition, Agnico-Eagle subscribed to a private placement of subscription receipts by Stornoway for a total cost of $19.8 million. Stornoway acquiring the debt in full by way of assignment of the note in consideration for the issuance to the Company of 3,207,861 common shares of Stornoway at a deemed value of C$1.25 per share on February 12, 2007. In addition, on March 16, 2007, the Company purchased from Stornoway C$5 million in unsecured Series A Convertible Debentures and C$5 million in unsecured Series B Convertible Debentures. Both series of debentures matured two years after their date of issue and interest was payable under the debentures quarterly at 12% per annum. At the option of Stornoway, interest payments could be paid in cash or in shares of Stornoway. During 2008, the interest payments to the Company amounted to C$0.7 million and consisted of 1,940,614 shares (2007  C$0.9 million of which C$0.6 million was received in cash and the rest 302,450 shares) of Stornoway. On July 31, 2008, the Company purchased from treasury 12,222,222 common shares of Stornoway at a price of C$0.90 per common share. Stornoway used the proceeds of the private placement to redeem the C$10 million principal amount of convertible debentures held by the Company and to pay to the Company a C$1 million amendment fee in connection with the amendment of the debentures to permit early redemption. The Company received an additional 527,947 common shares of Stornoway in satisfaction of accrued but unpaid interest on the debentures prior to their redemption. As a result of these transactions, the Company increased its holdings in Stornoway from 27,520,809 common shares (approximately 13.6% of the issued and outstanding common shares) to 40,270,978 common shares (approximately 15.8% of the issued and outstanding common shares). 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES As part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company has been required to provide assurance in the form of letters of credit for environmental and site restoration costs, custom credits, government grants and other general corporate purposes. As at December 31, 2008, the total amount of these guarantees was $61.0 million. Certain of the Company's properties are subject to royalty arrangements. The following are the most significant royalties. The Company has a royalty agreement with the Finnish government relating to the Kittila Mine. Starting 12 months after the mining operations commence, the Company has to pay 2% on net smelter return, defined as revenue less processing costs. The royalty is paid on a yearly basis the following year. The Company is committed to pay a royalty on future production from the Meadowbank mine project. The Nunavut Tunngavik-administered mineral claims are subject to production leases including a 12% net profits interest royalty from which annual deductions are limited to 85% of gross revenue. Production from Crown mining leases is subject to a royalty of up to 14% of adjusted net profits, as defined in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations under the Territorial Lands Act (Canada). The Company is committed to pay a royalty on production from properties in the Abitibi area. The type of royalty agreements include but are not limited to net profits interest royalty and net smelter return royalty with percentages ranging from 0.5% to 5%. The Company is committed to pay a royalty on production from properties in the Pinos Altos area. The type of royalty agreements include but are not limited to net profits interest royalty and net smelter return royalty with percentages ranging from 2.5% to 3.5%. 13. LEASES (a)Capital Leases The Company has agreements with third-party providers of mobile equipment for the development of the Meadowbank mine project and the Kittila Mine. These arrangements represent capital leases in accordance with the guidance in FAS 13. The leases for mobile equipment at the Kittila Mine are for five years and the leases for mobile equipment at the Meadowbank mine project are for three years. The effective annual interest rate on the lease for mobile equipment at Meadowbank is 3.15%. The effective annual interest rate on the lease for mobile equipment at Kittila is 4.99%. 157 AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated) December 31, 2008 13. LEASES (Continued) The following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments under capital leases together with the present value of the net minimum lease payments as at December 31, 2008. Year ending December 31: 2009 $ 10,421 2010 7,348 2011 1,424 2012 1,325 2013 2,852 Thereafter  Total minimum lease payments 23,370 Less amount representing interest 1,499 Present value of net minimum lease payments $ 21,871 The Company's capital lease obligations at December 31 are comprised as follows: 2008 2007 Total future lease payments $ 23,370 $ 17,524 Less: Interest (1,499 ) (1,353 ) 21,871 16,171 Less: Current portion 9,792 9,706 Long-term portion of capital leases $ 12,079 $ 6,465 At the end of 2008, the gross amount of assets recorded under capital leases amounted to $30.7 million (2007  $16.1 million; 2006  nil). (b)Operating Leases The Company has a number of operating lease agreements involving office space. Some of the leases for office facilities contain escalation clauses for increases in operating costs and property taxes. Future minimum lease payments required to meet obligations that have initial or remaining non-cancellable lease terms in excess of one year as at December 31, 2008 are as follows: Minimum lease payments: 2009 $ 1,115 2010 861 2011 822 2012 803 2013 718 Thereafter 6,463 Total $ 10,782 Total rental expense for operating leases was $3.1 million in 2008 (2007  $1.4 million; 2006  $0.7 million). 14. RESTRICTED CASH In October 2008, the Company raised approximately $43.5 million through the issuance of 779,250 flow-through common shares at a price of C$70 per share. To comply with the flow-through share agreement, the Company must incur $31.0 million of eligible Canadian exploration expenditures in 2009 related to the expenditures renounced in 2008 (note 6(b)). 158 AGNICO-EAGLE MINES LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated) December 31, 2008 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS From time to time, Agnico-Eagle has entered into financial instruments with a number of financial institutions in order to hedge underlying cash flow and fair value exposures arising from changes in commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices or foreign currency exchange rates. In 2008, financial instruments which have subjected Agnico-Eagle to market risk and concentration of credit risk consisted primarily of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Agnico-Eagle places its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in high quality securities issued by government agencies, financial institutions and major corporations and limits the amount of credit exposure by diversifying its holdings. Agnico-Eagle generates almost all of its revenues in US dollars. The Company's Canadian operations, which include the LaRonde Mine, the Goldex Mine and the Lapa and Meadowbank mine projects, have Canadian dollar requirements for capital, operating and exploration expenditures. Prior to 2006 Agnico-Eagle entered into a series of put and call option contracts to hedge a monthly sum of Canadian dollar expenditures based on its forecast Canadian dollar requirements. The Company's written put options did not qualify for hedge accounting and thus were not designated as hedging instruments. As such, changes in fair value for these instruments were recorded in consolidated statements of income. These instruments were entered into to set a range for the US dollar, along with the zero-cost collar of purchased put options and written call options. In December 2005, the Company's entire foreign exchange derivative position was collapsed generating cash flow of $4.1 million. As a result of this transaction, Agnico-Eagle had no foreign exchange derivative positions at December 31, 2005. In 2006 however, the Company reclassified a gain of $4.1 million relating to its foreign exchange derivative contracts to income. As at December 31, 2006 the remaining balance in accumulated other comprehensive income was nil. In 2008, to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates, the Company entered into three zero cost collars to hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows associated with the Canadian dollar denominated capital expenditures. The purchase of US dollar put options has been financed through selling US dollar call options at a higher level such that the net premium payable to the different counterparties by the Company is nil. The hedged items represents monthly unhedged forecasted Canadian dollar cash outflows during 2009. The cash flow hedging relationship meets all requirements per SFAS 133 to be perfectly effective, and unrealized gains and losses is recognized within other comprehensive income ("OCI"). Gains and losses deferred in accumulated OCI are reclassified into income when amortization (or depreciation) of the hedged capital asset begins. In other words, gains and losses in accumulated OCI are reclassified into income in the same period or periods the asset affects income. Amounts transferred out of accumulated OCI are recorded in depreciation expense. The total amount of unrealized loss on the hedges was $8.9 million as at December 31, 2008. None of this amount is expected to be reclassified into earnings in 2009. As at December 31, 2008, the Company had two unmatured covered call options on available-for-sale securities with an unrecognized premium including a mark-to-market valuation, amounting to $3.9 million. The total amount of $3.9 million will be recognized through the consolidated statements of income in the first quarter of 2009. As at December 31, 2008, there were no metal derivative positions. Other required derivative disclosures can be found in note 6(f), "Accumulated other comprehensive loss". Agnico-Eagle's exposure to interest rate risk at December 31, 2008 relates to its cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash totalling $99 million (2007  $396 million) and its credit facilities. The Company's short-term investments and cash equivalents have a fixed weighted average interest rate of 3.21% (2007  5.14%).
