Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  continued The loss of grantor trust status would have adverse tax consequences. Compliance with Section 646 of the Internal Revenue Code is integral to the level of distributions paid to the certificate holders. Should it be determined that we have violated the requirements of Section 646, the Trust would be taxed as a corporation versus a grantor trust. This would mean our income would be taxable upon our receipt and again upon receipt by the certificate holders. It is the Trustees opinion that the Trust has remained in compliance with the provisions of Section 646 since its election in 1988. The Trust terminates April 6, 2015. As previously reported, the termination date of the Trust is April 6, 2015. Accordingly, acknowledging the downward movement of the share price of certificates of beneficial interest in early 2014, we remind certificate holders that there will be remaining only four regular quarterly distributions declared in the year 2014 and one regular quarterly distribution declared in the year 2015. While there will be some income allocated to the second quarter of 2015 (representing six days of business), it is expected that this amount will be nominal and will likely be included with the final distribution to certificate holders, which final distribution will occur upon the completion of the wind-down process of the Trust and upon approval of the Trusts final accounting by the Judge of the Ramsey County District Court. As described earlier in this report, upon termination of the Trust on April 6, 2015, the certificates of beneficial interest (shares) will be cancelled and have no further value other than the final distribution. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
