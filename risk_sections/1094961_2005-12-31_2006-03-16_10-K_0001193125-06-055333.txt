Item 1A. Risk Factors Except for the historical information contained or incorporated by reference, this annual report on Form 10-K and the information incorporated by reference contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to differences in our actual results include those discussed in the following section, as well as those discussed in Part I, Item 1 entitled Business, Part II, Item 7 entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere throughout this annual report and in any other documents incorporated by reference into this annual report. You should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. We have not achieved profitability and we anticipate continuing losses, which may cause our stock price to fall. We have experienced significant losses each year since inception, and we expect to continue to incur additional losses as we complete the development of the eTag technology and commercialize products for oncology. We have experienced losses applicable to common stockholders of $37.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $225.3 million, including a charge in 2004 of $100.6 million for in-process research and development related to our merger with ACLARA. Though we recorded a net profit in the second quarter of 2005, due to the favorable adjustment to the Contingent Value Rights, or CVRs, liability, we have not achieved profitability on an annualized basis. We expect to continue to incur losses, primarily as a result of expenses related to:  research and product development costs, including the continued development and validation of the eTag technology and products based on that technology;  clinical studies to validate the effectiveness of eTag assays as tests for responsiveness of cancer patients to particular cancer therapies;  sales and marketing activities related to existing and planned products, including the development of a sales organization focused on the oncology market;  development of operational and sales and marketing infrastructure to support the availability of our Co-receptor Tropism Assay outside of the U.S.;  additional clinical laboratory and research space and other necessary facilities;  general and administrative costs to support growth of the business;  potential charges related to marking to market the liability for the CVRs;  charges for stock based compensation related to assumed ACLARA options and the related CVRs issuable upon their exercise;  charges for stock based compensation resulting from the implementation of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006; and  charges for vacating and subleasing the former ACLARA facility in Mountain View, California that are in excess of the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005. If our losses continue, our liquidity may be impaired, our stock price may fall and our stockholders may lose part or all of their investment. Our potential payments to holders of contingent value rights, which may be greater than currently estimated, would decrease our liquidity, could cause dilution to our stockholders and may cause the market price of our common stock to fall. Under the terms of the contingent value rights, we are obligated to make a payment to the holders of contingent value rights on June 10, 2006 if the volume weighted mean of the sales prices of our common stock 22 Table of Contents for the 15 trading days prior to June 10, 2006 is less than $2.90 (unless the CVRs have been automatically extinguished earlier, in accordance with their terms). The maximum aggregate amount payable by us under the contingent value rights is currently estimated to be approximately $55.1 million, based on approximately 62.7 million CVRs outstanding as of December 31, 2005. If the total amount becomes due, we must pay the first $31.3 million in cash, and may, at our option but subject to certain limitations, pay the remaining $23.8 million balance in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of the two. In addition, the maximum amount payable under the CVRs will increase by $5.2 million if all assumed ACLARA stock options are exercised. We can make no assurances as to the timing or extent of any option exercise activity. If the conditions requiring us to make payments to the holders of contingent value rights are satisfied and all assumed ACLARA options are exercised, we would be required to pay up to approximately $60.3 million, which would result in a decrease in liquidity, which may adversely impact our ongoing business. If we are required to make the maximum payment under the CVRs, we may have insufficient cash balances to make this entire payment in cash, and if we did have sufficient cash balances and elected to make part or all of the payment in cash our liquidity would be significantly and adversely affected. If we elected to make a portion of any CVR payment in shares of our common stock, existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution of their Monogram Biosciences holdings. In addition, a large volume of the shares issued as a portion of the CVR payment could be sold in a short period of time, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline. Even if we are not required to make the maximum payment, we may be required to make a substantial payment in cash and such payment would have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity. New entry inhibitor drugs for treatment of HIV may not be successful in clinical trials, trials may be terminated and if successful, the drugs may not require our testing services when approved. If the drugs are approved by FDA and require our testing services, we may not be able to adequately meet the demand for these services in all markets. Our testing services, including our HIV Co-Receptor Tropism Assay, have been used by certain pharmaceutical company customers in phase III clinical trials of the new class of CCR5 Entry Inhibitor drugs. One of these trials was initiated by a pharmaceutical company customer in late 2004 and has been a significant source of revenue in 2005. This trial is ongoing. An additional phase III trial was initiated by a second pharmaceutical company customer in July 2005, although in October 2005 this trial was terminated as a result of observed liver toxicity in the Phase III trial and related Phase II trial. Testing for a third phase III trial sponsored by a third pharmaceutical company customer was anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2005, although in this case a related phase II trial was terminated in October 2005 by the same customer due to a return of detectable virus in some patients late in therapy compared to the control regimen, and the timing for the phase III trial is not known. The use of our testing services in these programs has generated additional pharmaceutical testing revenues in 2005. Pfizer, the customer whose phase III trial was initiated in late 2004 and is ongoing, accounted for 19% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 including revenue related to the phase III trial. As additional patients are screened and enrolled in these trials, this could continue to be an important source of pharmaceutical testing revenues and if the drugs get approved this could also be a source of future patient testing revenues. However, the progress of such clinical trials and the likelihood of trials being successful and the drugs receiving FDA approval are subject to significant uncertainty and are determined by factors outside of our control. Difficulties encountered by our pharmaceutical company customers related to patient enrolment, drug performance, regulatory considerations and other factors could cause the trials to be delayed or terminated, as has already happened as described above. If additional such events occurred, our pharmaceutical testing revenues would be adversely affected and could decline. If safety or efficacy concerns arise related to the entire class of CCR5 Entry Inhibitor drugs, all clinical trials related to this class of drugs could be terminated, which would abruptly and negatively impact our revenues. There is also no guarantee that our testing services will be required or used by physicians if the drugs are approved by the FDA. If such use does not develop after approval then these drugs will not generate significant future patient testing revenues. If the drugs are approved and our testing services are required for these drugs, we may not be able to deliver our testing services on a global basis in support of the drugs, which could damage our market position, adversely affect our business, and cause our revenues to decline. 23 Table of Contents We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and our revenues may decline significantly if any major customer cancels, reduces or delays a purchase of our products. Our revenues to date consist, and are anticipated to consist in 2006, largely of sales of HIV testing products. We have significant customer concentration and the loss of any major customer or the reduced use of our products by a major customer could have a significant negative impact on our revenue. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 22%, 31% and 29%, respectively of our revenues were derived from tests performed for the beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Additionally, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, Pfizer Incorporated represented approximately 19%, 7% and 8%, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated represented approximately 11%, 12% and 9% and GlaxoSmithKline represented approximately 10%, 4% and 6% of our total revenue, respectively. Gross accounts receivable balances from Medicare and Medicaid represented 33% and 35% of gross accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. It is likely that we will have significant customer concentration in the future. Although certain of our agreements with pharmaceutical company customers have provisions for minimum purchases, these provisions are generally subject to annual renewal or cancellation provisions. The loss of any major customer, a slowdown in the pace of increasing physician and physician group sales as a percentage of sales, cancellation or non-renewal of agreements with pharmaceutical company customers, the delay of significant orders from any significant customer, even if only temporary, or delays or terminations of clinical trials by pharmaceutical company customers, could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and our ability to fund operations from revenues, generate cash from operations or achieve profitability. Proposed new products based on the eTag technology could be delayed or precluded by regulatory, clinical or technical obstacles, thereby delaying or preventing the development, introduction and commercialization of these new products and adversely impacting our revenue and profitability. We are developing testing products for use in connection with the treatment of cancer patients. These products will be based on the proprietary eTag technology and are expected to leverage our experience in patient testing for HIV. We expect that the development and commercialization of eTag assays for use in clinical trials by pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers could exceed one year. In addition, we expect to commercialize clinical assays for diagnostic use in patient testing, upon the successful completion of product development and automation for high throughput, validation of assays in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, certified laboratory format, and attainment of clinical validation through clinical trials, which could also exceed one year, and successful leveraging of research and development planned to be expended on clinical assays for use in clinical trials by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The completion of these research and development activities is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the extent of clinical trials required for regulatory and marketing purposes, the timing and results of clinical trials, failure to validate the technology in clinical trials and failure to achieve necessary regulatory approvals. These factors make it impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether we will be able to complete the development of commercial products utilizing eTag technology or if we are able to do so what the cost and timing of such completion may be. The FDA may impose medical device regulatory requirements on our tests, including possibly premarket approval requirements, which could be expensive and time-consuming and could prevent us from marketing these tests. In the past, the FDA has not required that genotypic or phenotypic testing conducted at a clinical laboratory be subject to premarketing clearance or approval, although the FDA has stated that it believes its jurisdiction extends to tests generated in a clinical laboratory. We received a letter from the FDA in September 2001 that asserted such jurisdiction over in-house tests like ours, but which also stated the FDA was not currently requiring premarket approval for HIV monitoring tests such as ours provided that the promotional claims for such tests are limited to its analytical capabilities and do not mention the benefit of making treatment decisions on the basis of test results. The FDA letter to us also asserted that our GeneSeq test had been misbranded due to the use of purchased analyte specific reagents, or ASRs, if test reports do not include a statement disclosing that the test has 24 Table of Contents not been cleared or approved by the FDA. Since 2002, we have utilized in-house prepared ASRs in our products. The FDA has indicated in discussions that the focus of the letter was our genotypic tests and not our phenotypic tests, but there is no certainty its focus will remain narrow. We have had several discussions with the FDA related to its positions set forth in the letter. We do not at this point believe the FDA will require us to take steps that materially affect our business or financial performance, but cannot guarantee this will remain the case. We cannot be sure that the FDA will accept the steps we take, or that the FDA will not require us to alter our promotional claims or undertake the expensive and time-consuming process of seeking premarket approval with clinical data demonstrating the sensitivity and specificity of our currently offered tests or tests in development, including tests for oncology based on our eTag technology. If premarket approval is required, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain it in a timely fashion or at all; and in such event the FDA would have authority to require us to cease marketing tests until such approval is granted. In addition, the production of the future cancer test kits may be subject to Good Manufacturing Practice Regulation, or GMP, under the auspices of the FDA. Our facilities are not GMP compliant. If the manufacture of the proposed kits is subject to GMP regulation, then we will be required to establish a GMP compliant facility, or to enter into a relationship with a third party manufacturer that operates a GMP compliant facility. We do not have experience with GMP compliance. GMP compliance, or entry into a manufacturing relationship with a third party manufacturer, would be time-consuming and expensive. We anticipate that if we are required to establish our own GMP compliant facility, or we elect to enter into a relationship with a GMP compliant third party, either process would be completed in parallel with developing the proposed testing products, could take over one year, and would require significant start-up costs and would significantly increase on-going overhead costs. In general, we cannot predict the extent of future FDA regulation of our business. We might be subject in the future to greater regulation, or different regulations, that could have a material effect on our finances and operations. If we fail to comply with existing or additional FDA regulations, it could cause us to incur civil or criminal fines and penalties, increase our expenses, prevent us from increasing revenues, or hinder our ability to conduct our business. With the broadening of our business from infectious disease to oncology, we are a larger and broader organization. If our management is unable to adequately manage the company, our operating results will suffer. As a result of our merger with ACLARA, we hired approximately 35 of the 55 employees based at ACLARAs facility in Mountain View, California before the merger. Currently, our total number of employees is approximately 290. Our proposed testing products using the eTag technology and our commercialization infrastructure have not yet been developed, and the two will need to be integrated as a necessary part of the development process. We do not have experience in commercializing testing products for use in the oncology field. We face challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees and addressing new markets, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs and the need to build a sales organization focused on oncologists. Difficulties or delays in successfully managing the substantially larger and broader organization could have a material adverse effect on our business and, as a result, on the market price of our common stock. We could lose key personnel, which could materially affect our business and require us to incur substantial costs to recruit replacements for lost personnel. We consider William D. Young, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Christos J. Petropoulos, Ph.D., Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, Michael Bates, M.D., Vice President, Clinical Research, and Jeannette Whitcomb, Ph.D., Vice President, Operations, to be key to the management of our business and operations. 25 Table of Contents Any of our key personnel could terminate their employment at any time and without notice. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our key employees. Any failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. Charges to operations resulting from the possible future impairment of goodwill and intangible assets may adversely affect the market value of our common stock. If we are unable to successfully develop products based on the eTag technology, acquired in our merger with ACLARA, our financial results, including earnings (loss) per common share, could be adversely affected. In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, we have accounted for the merger as a business combination. We have allocated the total purchase price to the acquired net tangible assets, amortizable intangible assets, and in-process research and development based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the merger, and have recorded the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. In addition, we have capitalized certain patent costs related to our infectious disease technologies and products. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. The additional charges could adversely affect our financial results, including earnings (loss) per common share, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Holders of our contingent value rights, or CVRs, will not be able to determine the payment to be received under the contingent value rights until June 10, 2006, and the CVRs may expire or be extinguished without any payment thereunder. Holders of our CVRs will not know the amount of payment, if any, that a contingent value right will receive until either June 10, 2006, or such earlier time as the contingent value rights are automatically extinguished. The payment, if any, that each contingent value right will entitle its holder to receive will depend on the average volume weighted mean of the sales prices of our common stock for the 15 trading days ending on and including June 10, 2006. For every cent that the 15 day average is below $2.90, the contingent value right will have the right to a payment of $0.01 per CVR, with a maximum payment of $0.88 per CVR. If we are required to make any payment to the holders of CVRs, the first $0.50 per CVR of any such payment must be made in cash. The balance of any such payment, up to $0.38 per CVR, may, at our election, be made in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of the two. If we elect to make any portion of a payment to holders of CVRs through the issuance of shares of our common stock then, as a condition precedent, such shares must, among other things, be issued either in a transaction that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act through satisfaction of the requirements of Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, or pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. If these conditions precedent cannot be satisfied then we must make the entire amount of any payment due under the CVRs in cash. If at any point during the 18 month period ending on June 10, 2006, the daily volume weighted mean of the sales prices of our common stock is greater than or equal to $3.50 for 30 consecutive trading days, the contingent value rights will be automatically extinguished and no payment will be made on them. Our financial results and financial position may be adversely impacted by, and may fluctuate as a result of, the contingent value rights. Until June 10, 2006, or the earlier extinguishment of the contingent value rights in accordance with their terms, we will be required under generally accepted accounting principles to record adjustments in our quarterly statements of operations based on the fair value of our estimated obligation to make payments to the holders of contingent value rights and the variable accounting associated with the stock options that have underlying CVRs. Our estimated obligation to make payments under the CVRs will vary depending, at the time the estimate is made, on the market price, if any, of the contingent value rights and the stock options associated with CVRs, and the extent to which assumed ACLARA stock options are exercised. As a result, our estimated obligation under 26 Table of Contents the contingent value rights could vary from period to period, resulting in significant fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter, including our reported earnings or loss per share, which could cause the market price of our common stock to fall abruptly and significantly. If, at June 10, 2006, we are required to make a payment under the contingent value rights, we will thereafter be obligated to make equivalent payments to holders of assumed ACLARA stock options upon the exercise of those options. The aggregate amount payable upon the exercise of assumed ACLARA stock options will be equal to the number of shares of our common stock subject to those options multiplied by the amount of cash or cash and Monogram Biosciences common stock required to be paid with respect to a single contingent value right. For fiscal periods ending after June 10, 2006, we will be required to record a charge against our statement of operations to reflect the maximum amount payable upon the exercise of assumed ACLARA stock options, based on the number of shares of our common stock for which such options are then exercisable according to their vesting provisions. In addition, we may periodically record a benefit to our statement of operations to the extent that any assumed ACLARA stock options expire prior to exercise. The combination of these charges and benefits could lead to fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter. An active public market may not be sustained for the CVRs, or they may trade at low volumes, both of which could depress the resale price, if any, of the securities. The CVRs are a new security for which there is a limited public trading market. We cannot predict whether an active public trading market for the securities will be sustained. The CVRs are currently quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB) under the ticker symbol MGRMR.OB. Because the OTCBB is a quotation service for NASD Market Makers, and not an issuer listing service or securities market, there are no listing requirements that must be met by an OTCBB issuer. There are, however, certain requirements that an issuer must meet in order for its securities to be eligible for a market maker to enter a quotation on the OTCBB. We believe that we satisfy these requirements, and that we will continue to satisfy these requirements for the foreseeable future. Investors should note however, that because issuers are not permitted to submit applications to be quoted on the OTCBB, we cannot guarantee that the CVRs will remain listed on the OTCBB. Continued quotation of the CVRs on the OTCBB will depend on ongoing sponsorship by one or more market makers who demonstrate compliance with SEC Rule 15c2-11. Even if a public trading market for the CVRs is sustained, there may be little or no market demand for the CVRs, making it difficult or impossible to sell CVRs on the public market, and depressing the resale price, if any, of the CVRs. In addition, holders of CVRs may incur brokerage charges in connection with the resale of the CVRs, which in some cases could exceed the proceeds realized by the holder from the resale of its CVRs. We cannot predict the price, if any, at which the CVRs will trade. Our obligation to make payments to the holders of CVRs will be unsecured, and holders of CVRs are not assured of receiving any payments owed to them under the CVRs. Our obligation to make payments under the CVRs, if any, will be unsecured. While we intend to maintain cash resources for potential CVR payments, any amounts owing under the CVRs will be general unsecured obligations. If, at June 10, 2006, we are required to make a payment under the CVRs, holders of the CVRs cannot be assured that we will have sufficient funds or available common stock to do so. If we are unable to make a required payment under the CVRs, the holders of CVRs will have equal priority in making claims against and receiving assets from us as will our general creditors. If we are unable to make payments owing under the CVRs, the holder of a CVR may receive none, or only a portion of, any amount that is owed under the CVRs. Our current products may not continue to receive market acceptance and our potential future products may not achieve market acceptance, which could limit our future revenue. Our ability to establish our testing products, both current and potential, as the standard of care to guide and improve the treatment of viral diseases and cancer will depend on continued acceptance and use of our current testing products by physicians and clinicians and pharmaceutical companies, similar acceptance and use of our 27 Table of Contents potential future products and the development and commercialization of new drugs and drug classes that require or could benefit from testing services such as ours. While certain testing products for viral diseases are established, others are still relatively new, and testing products for the treatment of cancer have not yet been developed. We cannot predict the extent to which physicians and clinicians will accept and use these testing products. They may prefer competing technologies and products. The commercial success of these testing products will require demonstrations of their advantages and potential clinical and economic value in relation to the current standard of care, as well as to competing products. Market acceptance of our products will depend on:  our marketing efforts and continued ability to demonstrate the utility of PhenoSense in guiding anti-viral drug therapy, for example, through the results of retrospective and prospective clinical studies;  our ability to demonstrate the advantages and potential economic value of our PhenoSense testing products over current treatment methods and other resistance tests;  the success of clinical trials of the new class of CCR5 entry inhibitor drugs for HIV in which our testing services are being used, whether those drugs get approved by the FDA and whether our tests are required after the drugs are approved;  our ability to demonstrate to potential customers the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of our eTag technology, relative to competing technologies and products;  the extent to which opinion leaders in the scientific and medical communities publish supportive scientific papers in reputable academic journals;  the extent and success of our efforts to market, sell and distribute our testing products;  the timing and willingness of potential collaborators to commercialize our PhenoSense and eTag products and other future testing product candidates;  general and industry-specific economic conditions, which may affect our pharmaceutical customers research and development, clinical trial expenditures and the use of our PhenoSense and eTag products;  progress of clinical trials conducted by our pharmaceutical customers;  our ability to generate clinical data indicating correlation between data recognized by eTag assays and clinical responses to particular drugs;  changes in the cost, quality and availability of equipment, reagents and components required to manufacture or use our PhenoSense and eTag products and other future testing product candidates;  the development by the pharmaceutical industry of anti-viral drugs and targeted medicines for specific patient populations, the success of these targeted medicines in clinical trials and the adoption of our technological approach in these development activities; and  our ability to develop new products. If the market does not continue to accept our existing testing products, such as our PhenoSense products or does not accept our future testing products such as products based on the eTag technology, our ability to generate revenue will be limited. Our revenues will be limited or diminished if changes are made to the way that our products are reimbursed, or if government or third-party payors limit the amounts that they will reimburse for our current products, or do not authorize reimbursement for our planned products. Government and third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid require that we identify the services we perform in our clinical laboratory using industry standard codes known as the Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes, which are developed by the American Medical Association, or AMA. Most payors maintain a list of standard reimbursement rates for each such code, and our ability to be reimbursed for our services is therefore effectively limited by our ability to describe the services accurately using the CPT codes. From time to time, the AMA changes its instructions about how our services should be coded using the CPT 28 Table of Contents codes. If these changes leave us unable to accurately describe our services or we are not coordinated with payors such that corresponding changes are made to the payors reimbursement schedules, we may have to renegotiate our pricing and reimbursement rates, the changes may interrupt our ability to be reimbursed, and/or the overall reimbursement rates for our services may decrease dramatically. In addition, we may spend significant time and resources to minimize the impact of these changes on reimbursement. Government and third-party payors are attempting to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare and are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of healthcare products. This could in the future limit the price that we can charge for our products or cause fluctuations in reimbursement rates for our products. This could hurt our ability to generate revenues. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of new medical products like the products we are currently developing and that we expect to develop, particularly if these products fail to show demonstrable value in clinical studies. If government and other third-party payors do not continue to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our testing products or do not authorize reimbursement for our planned products, our revenues will be reduced. Billing complexities associated with health care payors could delay our accounts receivable collection, impair our cash flow and limit our ability to reach profitability. Billing for laboratory services is complex. Laboratories must bill various payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, insurance companies, doctors, employer groups and patients, all of whom have different requirements. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 22%, 31% and 29%, respectively of our revenues were derived from tests performed for the beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, gross accounts receivable balances from Medicare and Medicaid represented 33% and 35% of gross accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Billing difficulties often result in a delay in collecting, or ultimately an inability to collect, the related receivable. This impairs cash flow and ultimately reduces profitability if we are required to record bad debt expense and/or contractual adjustments for these receivables. Our accounts receivable balances have increased during 2005 and 2004. We recorded bad debt expense of $0.8 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Among many other factors complicating billing are:  complexity of procedures, and changes in procedures, for electronic processing of insurance claims;  cumbersome nature of manual processes at payors for processing claims where electronic processing is not possible;  pricing or reimbursement differences between our fee schedules and those of the payors;  changes in or questions about how products are to be identified in the requisitions;  disputes between payors as to which party is responsible for payment;  disparity in coverage among various payors; and  difficulties of adherence to specific compliance requirements and procedures mandated by various payors. Ultimately, if all issues are not resolved in a timely manner, our cash flows could be impaired and our ability to reach profitability could be limited We may encounter problems or delays in processing tests, or in expanding our automated testing systems, which could impair our ability to grow our business, generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. In order to meet future projected demand for our products and fully utilize our current clinical laboratory facilities, we may have to expand the volume of patient samples that we are able to process. We will also need to incorporate the eTag assays into our laboratory processes. We will also need to continue to develop our quality-control procedures and to establish more consistency with respect to test turnaround so that results are 29 Table of Contents delivered in a timely manner. Thus, we will need to continue to develop and implement additional automated systems to perform our tests. We have installed laboratory information systems over the past few years to support the automated tests, analyze the data generated by our tests and report the results. If these systems do not work effectively as we scale up our processing of patient samples, we may experience processing or quality-control problems and may experience delays or failures in our operations. These problems, delays or failures could adversely impact the promptness and accuracy of our transaction processing, which could impair our ability to grow our business, generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. We have experienced periods during which processing of our test results was delayed and periods during which the proportion of samples for which results could not be generated were higher than expected. While we are continuing to attempt to minimize the likelihood of any recurrence of these issues, future delays, processing problems and backlog may nevertheless occur, resulting in the loss of our customers and/or revenue and an adverse effect on our results of operations. We face intense competition, and if our competitors existing products or new products are more effective than our products, the commercial opportunity for our products will be reduced or eliminated. The commercial opportunity for our products will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market new testing products that are superior to, or are less expensive than, the testing products that we develop using our proprietary technology. The biotechnology industry evolves at a rapid pace and is highly competitive. Our competitors for our HIV testing products include manufacturers and distributors of phenotypic and genotypic drug resistance technology, such as Tibotec-Virco, a division of Johnson & Johnson, Specialty Laboratories, Applied Biosystems Group, Visible Genetics, a division of Bayer Diagnostics, and reference and academic laboratories. We also compete with companies that are developing alternative technological approaches for patient testing in the cancer field. There are likely to be many competitive companies and many technological approaches in the emerging field of testing for likely responsiveness to the new class of targeted cancer therapies, including companies such as DakoCytomation A/S, Genzyme and Abbott Laboratories that currently commercialize testing products for guiding therapy of cancer patients. Established diagnostic product companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Roche Diagnostics and Bayer Diagnostics and established clinical laboratories such as Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of American may also develop or commercialize services or products that are competitive with those that we anticipate developing and commercializing. In addition, there are a number of alternative technological approaches being developed by competitors. In particular, while our anticipated oncology testing products will be based on the identification of protein-based differences among patients, there is significant interest in the oncology community in gene-based approaches that may be available from other companies, which may prove to be a superior technology to ours. Each of these competitors is attempting to establish its test as the standard of care. Our competitors may successfully develop and market other testing products that are either superior to those that we may develop or that are marketed prior to marketing of our testing products. One or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical by advances in existing technological approaches or the development of different approaches. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources, market presence and research and development staffs than we do. In addition, some of these competitors have significantly greater experience in developing products, and in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals of products and processing and marketing products. Various testing materials that we use are purchased from single qualified suppliers, which could result in our inability to secure sufficient materials to conduct our business. We purchase some of the testing materials used in our laboratory operations from single qualified suppliers. Although these materials could be purchased from other suppliers, we would need to qualify the suppliers prior to using their materials in our commercial operations. Although we believe we have ample inventory to allow validation of another source, in the event of a material interruption of these supplies, the quantity of our inventory may not be adequate. 30 Table of Contents Any extended interruption, delay or decreased availability of the supply of these testing materials could prevent us from running our business as contemplated and result in failure to meet our customers demands. If significant customer relationships were harmed by our failure to meet customer demands, our revenues may decrease. We might also face significant additional expenses if we are forced to find alternate sources of supplies, or change materials we use. Such expenses could make it more difficult for us to attain profitability, offer our products at competitive prices and continue our business as currently contemplated or at all. We may be dependent on licenses for technology we use in our testing products, and our business would suffer if these licenses were terminated or were not available. Historically, we have licensed technology from Roche that we use in our PhenoSense and GeneSeq tests. We hold a non-exclusive license for the life of the patent term of the last licensed Roche patent. We were notified by Roche that the license had terminated in March 2005 because the last licensed patent had expired. However, Roche advised us that additional licenses may be necessary for certain other patents and has offered us a license to these patents. We are in the process of reviewing whether additional licenses are necessary or useful for our operations. We believe such licenses are available on commercially acceptable terms. As we develop and begin to commercialize our testing products in oncology, we may encounter the need for licenses to technology owned by others in order to commercialize these products. We believe that if such licenses become necessary that they will be available on commercially acceptable terms. The intellectual property protection for our technology and trade secrets may not be adequate, allowing third parties to use our technology or similar technologies, and thus reducing our ability to compete in the market. The strength of our intellectual property protection is uncertain. In particular, we cannot be sure that:  we were the first to invent the technologies covered by our patents or pending patent applications;  we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;  others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;  any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents; or  any patents issued to us will provide a basis for commercially viable products or will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties. With respect to our viral disease portfolio, we currently have approximately 192 granted, issued, allowed, and pending patent applications in the United States and in other countries, including 40 issued patents. With respect to our potential oncology products and eTag technology, we currently have approximately 168 granted, issued, allowed, and pending patent applications in the United States and in other countries, including 17 issued patents. We have 138 granted, issued, allowed, and pending patent applications in the United States and in other countries, including 74 issued or allowed patents, relating to the historic microfluidics business of ACLARA. We had licensed certain patents under the Roche license discussed above. These patents covered a broad range of technology applicable across our entire current and planned product line. We have also licensed certain technology from Third Wave Technologies for gene expression based assays for research applications. Other companies may have patents or patent applications relating to products or processes similar to, competitive with or otherwise related to our current and planned products. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate, including biotechnology and information technology, is still evolving and, consequently, patent positions in these industries are generally uncertain. We will not be able to assure you that we will prevail in any lawsuits regarding the enforcement of patent rights or that, if successful, we will be awarded commercially valuable remedies. In addition, it is possible that we will not have the required resources to pursue offensive litigation or to otherwise protect our patent rights. 31 Table of Contents In addition to patent protection, we also rely on protection of trade secrets, know-how and confidential and proprietary information. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and their collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with them. However, we cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information or that adequate remedies would exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur. The unintended disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and future growth prospects. Further, we cannot assure you that others have not or will not independently develop substantially equivalent know-how and technology. In addition, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised during the discovery process of any litigation. During the course of any lawsuit, there may be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if we are not successful defending any such litigation or cannot obtain necessary licenses, we may have to pay substantial damages and/or be prohibited from selling our products. Our commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Companies in our industry typically receive a higher than average number of claims and threatened claims of infringement of intellectual property rights. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in the fields in which we are selling and/or developing or expect to sell and/or develop products. We may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products, technologies or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our products or technologies may infringe. There also may be existing patents, of which we are not aware, that our products or technologies may inadvertently infringe. Further, there may be issued patents and pending patent applications in fields relevant to our business, of which we may become aware from time to time, that we believe we do not infringe or that we believe are invalid or relate to immaterial portions of our overall business. We will not be able to assure you that third parties holding any of these patents or patent applications will not assert infringement claims against us for damages or seeking to enjoin our activities. We will also not be able to assure you that, in the event of litigation, we will be able to successfully assert any belief we may have as to non-infringement, invalidity or immateriality, or that any infringement claims will be resolved in our favor. Third parties have from time to time threatened to assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on our patents or other intellectual property rights or informed us that they believe we required one or more licenses in order to perform certain of our tests. For instance, we have been informed by Bayer Diagnostics, or Bayer, that it believes we require one or more licenses to patents controlled by Bayer in order to conduct certain of our current and planned operations and activities. We, in turn, believe that Bayer may require one or more licenses to patents controlled by us. Although we believe we do not need a license from Bayer for our HIV products, we have had discussions with Bayer concerning the possibility of entering into a cross-licensing or other arrangement, and believe that if necessary, licenses from Bayer would be available to us on commercially acceptable terms. However, in the future, we may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, for infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third partys patents. Further, we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties. Even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending a lawsuit will take significant time, and may be expensive and divert management attention from other business concerns. 32 Table of Contents Our business operations and the operation of our clinical laboratory facility are subject to stringent regulations and if we are unable to comply with them, we may be prohibited from accepting patient samples or may incur additional expense to attain and maintain compliance, which would have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. The operation of our clinical laboratory facilities is subject to a stringent level of regulation under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988. Laboratories must meet various requirements, including requirements relating to quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Our laboratories are also subject to regulations by the State of California and various other states. We have received accreditation by the College of American Pathologists and therefore are subject to their requirements and evaluation. Our failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in various penalties, including loss of certification or accreditation, and we may be prevented from conducting our business as we currently do or as we may wish to in the future. If we do not comply with laws and regulations governing the confidentiality of medical information, we may lose the state licensure we need to operate our business, and may be subject to civil, criminal or other penalties. Compliance with such laws and regulations could be expensive. The Department of Human Health and Services, or HHS, has issued final regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions, while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. Three principal regulations have been issued:  privacy regulations;  security regulations; and  standards for electronic transactions, or transaction standards. We have implemented the HIPAA privacy regulations. In addition, we implemented measures we believe will reasonably and appropriately meet the specifications of the security regulations and the transaction standards. These standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation. We will not be able to guarantee that our compliance measures will meet the specifications for any of these regulations. In addition, certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to us by physicians, could be required by certain payors. As a result of inconsistent application of requirements by payors, or our inability to obtain billing information, we could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. We cannot estimate the potential impact of payors implementing (or failing to implement) the HIPAA transaction standards on our cash flows and results of operations. In addition to the HIPAA provisions described above, there are a number of state laws regarding the confidentiality of medical information, some of which apply to clinical laboratories. These laws vary widely, and new laws in this area are pending, but they most commonly restrict the use and disclosure of medical information without patient consent. Penalties for violation of these laws include sanctions against a laboratorys state licensure, as well as civil and/or criminal penalties. Compliance with such rules could require us to spend substantial sums, which could negatively impact our profitability. We may be unable to build brand loyalty because our trademarks and trade names may not be protected. We may not be able to build brand loyalty around our broader business focus and new name. Our attempts to create a new corporate and brand identity may not be successful and may damage our existing brand loyalty. Our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names such as the names PhenoSense, PhenoSense GT, PhenoScreen, GeneSeq, and eTag may be challenged, canceled, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or 33 Table of Contents determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build brand loyalty. Brand recognition is critical to our short-term and long-term marketing strategies especially as we commercialize future enhancements to our products. In particular as we broaden the companys commercial focus from viral diseases to oncology and other serious diseases, we are attempting to establish a corporate identity for that broader business focus and, in September 2005, we changed our name from ViroLogic, Inc. to Monogram Biosciences, Inc. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in establishing brand recognition and loyalty for our new name and our attempts to do so could damage our existing brand loyalty. Clinicians or patients using our products or services may sue us and our insurance may not sufficiently cover all claims brought against us, which would increase our expenses. Clinicians, patients and others may at times seek damages from us if drugs are incorrectly prescribed for a patient based on testing errors or similar claims. Although we have obtained product liability insurance coverage of up to $6 million, and expect to continue to maintain product liability insurance coverage, we will not be able to guarantee that insurance will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or that our coverage will be sufficient to protect us against all claims that may be brought against us. We may not be able to maintain our current coverage, or obtain new insurance coverage for our planned future testing services and products, such as planned testing service and kits for use in connection with the treatment of cancer patients, on acceptable terms with adequate coverage, or at reasonable costs. We may incur significant legal defense expenses in connection with a liability claim, even one without merit or for which we have coverage. Decreased effectiveness of equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees, and proposed changes in accounting for equity compensation could adversely affect earnings. We have historically used stock options and other forms of equity-related incentives as a key component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock options and other long-term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued changes to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that requires us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other option plans commencing in the first quarter of 2006. Moreover, applicable stock exchange listing standards related to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could make it more difficult or expensive for us to grant options to employees in the future, which may result in changes in our equity compensation strategy. These and other developments in the provision of equity compensation to employees could make it more difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, and such a change in accounting rules may adversely impact our future financial condition and operating results. We may be subject to litigation, which would be time consuming and divert our resources and the attention of our management. ACLARA, with which we merged in December 2004, and certain of its former officers and directors, referred to together as the ACLARA defendants, are named as defendants in a securities class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. This action, which was filed on November 13, 2001 and is now captioned ACLARA BioSciences, Inc. Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, also names several of the underwriters involved in ACLARAs initial public offering, or IPO, as defendants. This class action is brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of ACLARA common stock from the time of ACLARAs March 20, 2000 IPO through December 6, 2000. The central allegation in this action is that the underwriters in the ACLARA IPO solicited and received undisclosed commissions from, and entered into undisclosed arrangements with, certain investors who purchased ACLARA stock in the IPO and the after-market. The complaint also alleges that the ACLARA defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose in the IPO prospectus that the underwriters had engaged in these allegedly undisclosed arrangements. More than 300 issuers who went public between 1998 and 2000 have been named in similar lawsuits. In July 2002, an omnibus motion to dismiss all complaints against issuers and individual defendants 34 Table of Contents affiliated with issuers (including ACLARA defendants) was filed by the entire group of issuer defendants in these similar actions. On February 19, 2003, the Court in this action issued its decision on the defendants omnibus motion to dismiss. This decision dismissed the Section 10(b) claim as to ACLARA but denied the motion to dismiss Section 11 claim as to ACLARA and virtually all of the other defendants. On June 26, 2003, the plaintiffs in the consolidated class action lawsuits announced a proposed settlement with ACLARA and the other issuer defendants. The proposed settlement, which was approved by ACLARAs board of directors, provides that the insurers of all settling issuers will guarantee that the plaintiffs recover $1 billion from non-settling defendants, including the investment banks who acted as underwriters in those offerings. In the event that the plaintiffs do not recover $1 billion, the insurers for the settling issuers will make up the difference. Under the proposed settlement, the maximum amount that could be charged to ACLARAs insurance policy in the event that the plaintiffs recovered nothing from the investment banks would be approximately $3.9 million. We believe that ACLARA had sufficient insurance coverage to cover the maximum amount that we may be responsible for under the proposed settlement. On August 31, 2005, the Court granted unconditional preliminary approval of the proposed settlement. The Court set the settlement fairness hearing for April 24, 2006. At the fairness hearing, the court will decide whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate for all class members, and whether to grant final approval of the settlement. It is possible that the Court may not give its final approval to the settlement in whole or part. If a final settlement is not reached or is not approved by the court, we believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously defend against the suit. As a result of this belief, no liability for this suit has been recorded in the accompanying financial statements. However, we could be forced to incur significant expenses in the litigation, and in the event there is an adverse outcome, our business could be harmed. Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, making it likely that, in some future quarter or quarters, we will fail to meet estimates of operating results or financial performance, causing our stock price to fall. If revenue declines in a quarter, our losses will likely increase or our earnings will likely decline because many of our expenses are relatively fixed. Though our revenues may fluctuate significantly as we continue to build the market for our products, expenses such as research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative are not affected directly by variations in revenue. The cost of our product revenue could also fluctuate significantly due to variations in the demand for our products and the relatively fixed costs to produce them. In addition, there could be significant fluctuations in the amounts recorded in our statement of operations for valuation adjustments to the CVRs and stock based compensation. We will not be able to accurately predict how volatile our future operating results will be because our past and present operating results, which reflect moderate sales activity, are not indicative of what we might expect in the future. As a result it will be very difficult for us to forecast our revenues accurately and it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters, our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the market price of our common stock may fall abruptly and significantly. Because our revenue and operating results will be difficult to predict, period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. In the event that we need to raise additional capital, our stockholders could experience substantial additional dilution. If such financing is not available on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to significantly curtail our operations or sell significant assets and may be unable to continue as a going concern. We anticipate that our capital resources, together with funds from the sale of our products, contract revenue and borrowing under equipment financing arrangements, will enable us to maintain our current research and development, marketing, production and general administrative activities related to HIV drug resistance in the United States, together with the development and initial commercialization of the eTag technology, at least for the next twelve months. The commercialization of the eTag technology is expected to include the development of a testing service and possibly test kits for use in connection with the treatment of cancer patients. However, we may need additional funding to accomplish these goals. Further we may have to establish additional 35 Table of Contents infrastructure to make available our Co-receptor Tropism Assay outside of the U.S. if the CCR5 drugs are approved by the FDA and our tests are required for these drugs after approval. To the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet our obligations, including lease payments and future requirements, we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development, commercialization and expansion of our technologies, including the eTag technology and products based on that technology. Our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, or to satisfy a portion of the potential payment for the CVR liability. However, we cannot guarantee that additional financing, in any form, will be available at all, or on terms acceptable to us. If we sell equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may incur substantial dilution and any shares so issued will likely have rights, preferences and privileges superior to the rights, preferences and privileges of our outstanding common and preferred stock. In the event financing is not available in the time frame required, we could be forced to reduce our operating expenses, curtail sales and marketing activities, reschedule research and development projects or delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our activities. Further, we might be required to sell certain of our assets or obtain funds through arrangements with third parties that require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products that we would seek to develop or commercialize on our own. These actions, while necessary for the continuance of operations during a time of cash constraints and a shortage of working capital, could make it difficult or impossible to implement our long-term business plans or could affect our ability to continue as a going concern. If a natural disaster strikes our clinical laboratory facilities and we are unable to receive and or process our customers samples for a substantial amount of time, we would lose revenue. We rely on a single clinical laboratory facility to process patient samples for our tests, which are received via delivery service or mail, and have no alternative facilities. We will also use this facility for conducting other tests we develop, including eTag assays, and even if we move into different or additional facilities they will likely be in close proximity to our current clinical laboratory. Our clinical laboratories and some pieces of processing equipment are difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead-time. Our facilities may be affected by natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods. Earthquakes are of particular significance because our facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, an earthquake-prone area, and we do not have insurance against earthquake loss. Our insurance coverage, if any, may not be adequate to cover total losses incurred in a natural disaster. However, even if covered by insurance, in the event our clinical laboratory facilities or equipment is affected by natural disasters, we would be unable to process patient samples and meet customer demands or sales projections. If our patient sample processing operations were curtailed or ceased, we would not be able to perform tests, which would reduce our revenues, and may cause us to lose the trust of our customers or market share. We use hazardous chemicals and biological materials in our business, and any claims relating to any alleged improper handling, storage, use or disposal of these materials could adversely harm our business. Our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We will not be able to eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We do not maintain insurance coverage for damage caused by accidental release of hazardous chemicals, or exposure of individuals to hazardous chemicals off of our premises. We could be subject to damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use, or the use by third parties, of these materials, and our liability under a claim of this nature may exceed our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. 36 Table of Contents Concentration of ownership among some of our stockholders may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions. Approximately 30% of our common stock is beneficially held by our directors, our executive officers, and greater than five percent stockholders. The most significant of these stockholders in terms of beneficial ownership are Perry Corp. and Deutsche Bank AG. Consequently, a small number of our stockholders may be able to substantially influence our management and affairs. If acting together, they would be able to influence most matters requiring the approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant corporate transaction. The concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control of Monogram Biosciences at a premium price if these stockholders oppose it. Our stock price may be volatile, and our common stock could decline in value. The market prices for securities of biotechnology companies in general have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. Our stock price has fluctuated widely during the last few years from a low of $0.72 per share in September 2002 to a high of $4.40 per share in January 2004. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant negative impact on the market price of our common stock:  period-to-period fluctuations in financial results;  financing activities;  potential payments required to be made under the Contingent Value Rights on June 10, 2006;  investor perceptions regarding the impact of the Contingent Value Rights on our liquidity and capital resources;  litigation;  delays in product introduction, launches or enhancements, including delays in completing the development of the eTag technology and products based on that technology;  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors;  results from clinical studies;  adverse developments in the clinical trials of drugs under development by our pharmaceutical company customers;  developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents;  publicity regarding actual or potential clinical results relating to products under development by our competitors or our own products or products under development;  regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;  changes in payor reimbursement policies; and  economic and other external factors or other disaster or crisis. A low or volatile stock price may negatively impact our ability to raise capital and to attract and maintain key employees. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may fall. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, the market price of our common stock may fall. As of December 31, 2005 we had 37 Table of Contents outstanding options under our employee stock options plan to purchase 18.3 million shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 14.4% of our common stock outstanding on December 31, 2005, at a weighted-average price of $2.42 per share. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, whether currently outstanding, or issued as the result of option exercises, might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Sales of a substantial number of shares could occur at any time. This may decrease the price of our common stock and may impair our ability to raise capital in the future. Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for our stockholders to replace our management and may inhibit a takeover, either of which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it difficult for our stockholders to replace or remove our management, and may delay or prevent an acquisition or merger in which we are not the surviving company. In particular:  Our board of directors is classified into three classes, with only one of the three classes elected each year, so that it would take at least two years to replace a majority of our directors;  Our bylaws contain advance notice provisions that limit the business that may be brought at an annual meeting and place procedural restrictions on the ability to nominate directors; and  Our common stockholders are not permitted to call special meetings or act by written consent. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions could discourage changes of our management and acquisitions or other changes in our control and otherwise limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock. We could adopt a stockholder rights plan, commonly referred to as a poison pill, at any time without seeking the approval of our stockholders. Stockholder rights plans can act through a variety of mechanisms, but typically would allow our board of directors to declare a dividend distribution of preferred share purchase rights on outstanding shares of our common stock. Each such share purchase right would entitle our stockholders to buy a newly created series of preferred stock in the event that the purchase rights become exercisable. The rights would typically become exercisable if a person or group acquires over a predetermined portion of our common stock or announces a tender offer for more than a predetermined portion of our common stock. Under such a stockholder rights plan, if we were acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction which had not been approved by our board of directors, each right would entitle its holder to purchase, at the rights then-current exercise price, a number of the acquiring companys common shares at a price that is preferential to the holder of the right. If adopted by the our board of directors, a stockholder rights plan may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us.
