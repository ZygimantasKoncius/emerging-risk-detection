Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution the reader that this list of important factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in rapidly changing businesses, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. We cannot predict every risk factor, nor can we assess the impact, if any, of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect managements analysis only as of the date hereof. In addition, readers should carefully review the other information in this Annual Report on Form 20-F and in the Companys periodic reports and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from time to time. 2 TABLE OF CONTENTS Part I - 4 Item 1.
