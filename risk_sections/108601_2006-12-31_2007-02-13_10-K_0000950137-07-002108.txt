Item 1A. Risk Factors. Significant factors that could impact the Companys business operations include, without limitation, the following: Availability or retention of retail space. In those countries where we maintain market leadership in the chewing gum segment, our ability to retain preferred retail space allocation will impact results. If we are not able to retain this allocation, our results could be negatively impacted. Availability of raw materials. We use many different raw materials to manufacture chewing gum and other confectionery products including sugar, corn syrup, flavoring oils, polyols and high intensity sweeteners. While these products are generally readily available on the open market, if we were unable to maintain the availability, pricing and sourcing of these raw materials, our results could be negatively impacted. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences. We operate in an increasingly competitive market. As such, our continued success is dependent upon our ability to continue to create and market products which appeal to our diverse consumers. Failure to adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics and product preferences, the failure of new or existing products to be favorably received, or our inability to otherwise adapt to changing market needs, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Changes in foreign currency and market conditions. Manufacturing and sales of a significant portion of our products are outside the United States. The majority of the countries in which we operate tend to be politically, socially and economically stable. To the extent there is political or social unrest, civil war, terrorism or significant economic instability, the results of our business in such countries could be negatively impacted. In addition, volatility in foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Increased competition, discounting and other competitive actions. We compete worldwide with other well-established manufacturers of confectionery products, including chewing gum. Our results may be negatively impacted by ineffective advertising, or by failure to sufficiently counter aggressive competitive actions. In addition, discounting and other competitive actions may make it more difficult for us to maintain our operating margins. 3 Underutilization of or inadequate manufacturing capacity and labor stoppages. Unanticipated movements in consumer demands could result in inadequate manufacturing capacity or underutilization of our manufacturing capacity which could negatively impact manufacturing efficiencies and costs. Governmental regulations. Governmental regulations with respect to import duties, tariffs, taxes and environmental controls, both in and outside the U.S., could negatively impact our costs and ability to compete in domestic or foreign marketplaces. Labor stoppages. To the extent we experience any material labor stoppages, such disputes or strikes could negatively affect shipments from suppliers or shipments of finished product. Outcome of integrating acquired businesses. Our inability to successfully integrate any acquired business or assets, including the acquisition of certain confectionary assets of Kraft Foods Global, Inc., could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results or expectations of the Companys business.
