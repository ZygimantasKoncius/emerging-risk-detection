Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Operations—Through our global activities, we are exposed to economic, political and other risks and uncertainties, any of which could adversely affect our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition,” for more information about potential risks we may face. 83 However, we believe this diversity also allows us to take advantage of opportunities arising in individual countries or regionally. Therefore, we believe we can benefit from positive economic trends and the increasing confidence in the economic recovery that took place in 2010 in many of the regions in which we operate. Overall we increased our total revenues in the three regions North America, Europe and the rest of the world in 2010 as compared to 2009. In addition to our worldwide presence, we believe that our product diversity across our three segments is a key driver of our results, allowing us access to different markets and giving us an ability to balance our performance. In 2010, for example, particularly during the second half of the year, we were able to compensate for the slower growth we experienced in our electricity segment, with growth in sales in our other segments. The Effects of Prices for Raw Materials and Components on Our Operations The majority of the $1,209 million cost of revenues we incurred in 2010 related to direct production materials, including commodities such as steel, resins, aluminum, brass and bronze and other supplies for our products, such as brass castings, aluminum housings, sheet metal, plastics and printed circuit board assemblies and other electronics. Commodity prices can vary significantly from period to period and are affected by changes in global economic conditions, supply and demand trends, technological changes and related industrial cycles. For example, we have experienced substantial swings in the price of brass, copper, steel, aluminum and resins, and in components that include them, which are important materials for the manufacture of accurate and durable meters. We have been seeking to counter this price volatility that we have experienced by entering into supply contracts for some of our raw materials and components, with terms from about one month to about one year, in an effort to lock in prices when we perceive that price increases may occur and to manage the risk of supply shortages. For example, we entered into contracts covering our forecasted requirements for brass and aluminum at prices we believe will, on average, prove to be competitive going into 2011. We intend to monitor market trends closely and adapt our supply contracts accordingly. During 2010, we experienced significantly extended lead times at those of our suppliers that provide electronic components used in some of our products. We believe that the resumption of economic growth in some of the world's economies, and the resulting demand for electronic components generally across a range of industrial sectors, has resulted in an increase in demand (after capacities had been reduced during the downturn) for commoditized electronic components that those suppliers use in producing circuit boards for us as well as for other customers, including customers in unrelated industries. In some cases, we have been required to place orders for electronics and electronic components six months or more in advance to ensure timely availability of these components. Some of our other suppliers have imposed limitations not only on purchases of their electronic components, but in other areas as well. 84 Focus on Efficiency in Our Global Manufacturing and Supply Functions Following our acquisition in September 2005, our management team initiated a Profit Improvement Program, or PIP. This program was designed to transform the operations that had been acquired into a single group focused on metering solutions by identifying manufacturing, supply chain and procurement processes within our company that could be made more efficient. Despite the beneficial effects of these programs, the impact of the financial crisis and economic downturn that began in 2008 led us to adopt a further program of efficiency improvements. These initiatives were intended to further rationalize our business and operations. In seeking to optimize our cost structure, we have also, through our PIP and other initiatives, focused on our sourcing, manufacturing footprint, overhead, indirect personnel and non-personnel related expense, capital expenditures and cash-related inventory control. During 2010, we extended and refocused our PIP program, which we now refer to as our Continuous Improvement Program, or CIP, to evaluate capacity usage and supply chain metrics in order to further enhance our operational processes. As part of these programs, we are continuing to improve our production processes, concentrate our production capacities in a reduced number of designated competence centers and transfer selected manufacturing activities to lower cost countries in order to gain efficiencies and manage costs. Our largest production centers are now concentrated in the United States, Germany and Slovakia. In addition, as part of our current initiatives in the area of procurement, we are redesigning many of our products, in particular those products which contain electronic components, in order to create more cost-effective designs and reduce the material costs associated with those products. Furthermore, we are renegotiating terms and conditions with a number of suppliers and will continue to actively manage supplier risks. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenues. The following table presents data on our revenues for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (in $ millions) Revenues 1,759.3 1,695.1 Our revenues increased by $64.2 million, or 3.8% to $1,759.3 million in 2010 compared to revenues of $1,695.1 million in 2009. On a constant currency basis, our revenues increased by 4.6%. Our business has typically been impacted by the level of regional economic growth in the markets in which we operate. Beginning at the end of the second quarter and through the third and fourth quarters of 2010, we saw increasingly positive economic trends and a stabilization of confidence in economic recovery in several regions in which we operate. This resulted in increased demand for our products and services in the United States and a number of countries in Europe and Asia. These increases occurred mainly in our gas segment and our water segment. Our growth from 2009 to 2010 was also due in part to an increase in our revenues from Smart Offerings in each of our three segments. 85 In 2010, we decided to adopt early an accounting policy related to revenue recognition in sales involving the delivery of multiple elements that included software. As a result, the revenues in our electricity segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were approximately $17.1 million higher than revenues would have been using the previous accounting policies for revenue recognition, see “—Critical Accounting Policies—Revenue Recognition.” In 2010, the substantial increase in our water segment and gas segment revenues were partially offset by a decline in our electricity segment revenues. In our gas segment, revenues increased by $44.0 million, or 4.9%, from $899.8 million to $ 943.8 million, as the demand for gas products increased considerably in the second half of 2010 due to the positive economic trends in several regions in which we operate. On a constant currency basis, revenues in our gas segment increased by 7.7%. Revenues in our water segment increased by $28.0 million or 7.9%, from $355.9 million to $383.9 million. We benefited from major projects in which we were deploying products in 2010 in the Middle East, North America and Asia, particularly during the second and third quarters of 2010. On a constant currency basis, revenues in our water segment increased by 6.5%. Revenues in our electricity segment decreased slightly by $1.6 million, or 0.4%, from $453.1 million to $451.5 million. Uncertainty regarding the stimulus money in the United States in the first half of 2010, extended customer evaluation periods of some of our customers in the second half of 2010 and the finalization of major projects in the Middle East in 2009 in volumes that did not repeat in 2010 were the main drivers in the decrease of our electricity segment revenues. This was to a certain extent offset by a significant upswing in revenues in Western Europe in 2010 compared to 2009, largely due to the expansion of our Smart Offerings in 2010 following an acquisition in late 2009. On a constant currency basis, revenues in our electricity segment decreased by 1.7%. For more information on our revenue developments and trends, see “—Results of Operations by Segment in the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009.” Revenues by region. The following table sets forth our revenues by region for the periods indicated. We categorize our revenues geographically based on the location to which we ship products or in which we provide services to our customers. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (in $ millions) North America United States 467.1 448.0 Other North America 102.8 111.2 Total 569.9 559.2 International Germany 239.0 256.0 Europe outside Germany 550.4 510.5 Other 400.0 369.4 Total 1,189.4 1,135.9 Total 1,759.3 1,695.1 86 Cost of revenues. Our cost of revenues consists principally of expenses relating to: · direct and indirect costs of raw materials and components; · salaries, wages and indirect costs of labor, including the employer portion of social security and other payroll taxes; · temporary employees; · warranty expenses; · other overhead and infrastructure expenses to the extent these relate to our manufacturing; · related depreciation and amortization; and · restructuring charges to the extent they relate to our manufacturing. The following table sets forth our cost of revenues, gross profit and related data for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Cost of revenues 1,208.6 68.7 1,191.3 70.3 Gross profit 550.8 31.3 503.8 29.7 Our cost of revenues increased by $17.3 million in 2010, or 1.5%, compared to 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher revenues as our gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 31.3% in 2010 from 29.7% in the prior year period. Several factors combined to drive this development in gross margins: · We benefited from a shift towards higher margin products in our gas segment, in particular for our gas metering and gas utilization products. Additionally, our water segment recorded higher revenues in product groups with higher margins, such as our volumetric residential and C&I related products, compared to 2009. · Manufacturing costs represented a lower percentage of our revenues in 2010 than in 2009 mainly due to the increase in capacity usage at our manufacturing facilities. · We were able to realize the benefits of our ongoing initiative to improve the efficiency of our supply chain, including the outsourcing of sub-assemblies, particularly in North America and Europe. Many of these measures occurred during 2009 and our gross profit began to reflect the impact of these measures in 2010. Due to the completion of certain initiatives in 2009, reorganization expenses such as severance payments, early retirement and other compensation expense to former employees as well as costs for the use of external services decreased significantly in 2010. This had a considerable positive impact on our gross margin. · These positive developments were partially offset by the write down of inventory in connection with our decision to terminate our relationship with one of our distributors in our electricity segment. The net impact on gross profit was $9.2 million in 2010. In the first quarter of 2010, we decided to cease doing business with the distributor when we became aware that the distributor may have engaged in conduct on behalf of other parties for which it acted that, if engaged in on our behalf, could have violated our compliance policies. 87 Selling expenses. Selling expenses consist primarily of: · salaries for personnel engaged in sales and marketing activities and the employer portion of social security and other payroll taxes; · shipping and handling costs; · commissions; · marketing and advertising expenses; · external services; · overhead and infrastructure expenses; and · related depreciation and amortization. The following table sets forth information on our selling expenses for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Selling expenses 165.5 9.4 159.4 9.4 Selling expenses increased by $6.1 million in 2010, or 3.8%, compared to the prior year period. The main reason for the increase was overall higher sales volumes as selling expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues did not change from the prior year. Additionally, the increase was also due in part to the expansion of our sales force that supports our key account and opportunity management teams in marketing our Smart Offerings, particularly in the United States and the European Union. Higher shipping and handling costs and travel expenses also contributed to the increase in selling expenses. The overall increase was partly offset by lower costs, such as reorganization costs resulting from severance payments, and commissions, resulting from a change in the country mix of our revenues. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: · salaries, including the employer portion of social security and other payroll taxes, not allocated to other functional costs; · until the completion of our IPO, expenses for our Management Equity Program, or MEP, an incentive program sponsored by our principal shareholder for some of our key management personnel; · expenses relating to our preparation to become a public company; · other overhead costs not allocated to manufacturing, R&D and selling; · IT costs not allocated to other functional costs; · external services, professional services and consultancy fees; · banking fees; and · related depreciation and amortization. 88 The following table sets forth information on our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Management Equity Program -13.6 -0.8 -33.3 -2.0 Other general and administrative expenses 137.4 7.8 170.3 10.1 Total general and administrative expenses 123.8 7.0 137.0 8.1 Our general and administrative expenses decreased by $13.2 million, or 9.6% in 2010. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to lower expenses for external consultants and advisors relating to the preparation of our IPO; although our IPO took place in late 2010, much of the preparatory work took place in 2009. In 2010, a non-cash gain of $13.6 million related to the MEP (compared to a $33.3 million gain in the prior year) also affected the development of general and administrative expenses. Until our IPO, we recognized compensation expense (or income) relating to the MEP in general and administrative expenses. This expense (or income) was determined by reference to a formula-based valuation of the shares in our company under the MEP. Since the completion of our IPO, we are no longer required to recognize any charges or income related to the MEP. For more information relating to the MEP, see "Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions." Our general and administrative expenses other than those relating to the MEP decreased by $32.9 million, or 19.3%, in 2010. As described above, this decrease was largely caused by lower expenses for legal advice, consulting and other external services mostly in conjunction with the preparation of becoming a public company. These lower expenses were partially offset by higher bonus expenses, which we incurred in connection with our IPO, and higher expenses for additional functions we require as a public company. Research and development expenses. Research and development, or R&D, expenses consist primarily of: · salaries for R&D personnel, including the employer portion of social security and other payroll taxes; · external services; · consulting expenses associated with R&D activities; · depreciation and amortization of our R&D assets; and · other overhead and infrastructure cost associated with our R&D activities. The following table sets forth information on our R&D expenses for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Research and development expenses 87.5 5.0 78.4 4.6 89 Our R&D expenses increased by $9.1 million, or 11.6%, in 2010. We increased our R&D headcount, as well as our use of external services, including engineering consultants and research institutes, particularly in connection with the development of our Smart Offerings. This increase was offset in part by lower expenses for reorganization. Other operating income (expense), net. Other operating income (expense), net mainly includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses. The following table sets forth information on other operating income (expense), net for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Other operating income (expense), net 2.1 0.1 14.8 0.9 The decrease in other operating income is mainly due to lower foreign currency exchange gains of $2.9 million in 2010 compared to gains of $14.4 million in 2009. Interest expense, net. The following table sets forth information on interest expense, net for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Interest expense, net 60.1 3.4 55.4 3.3 Interest expense, net increased by $4.7 million, or 8.5%, from $55.4 million in 2009 to $60.1 million in 2010. This increase resulted mainly from negative changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps. In addition, we faced increased guarantee expenses as we utilized the bonding facility under the Senior Facility agreement to a larger extent in 2010 as compared to 2009. Other income, net. The following table sets forth information on other income, net for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Other income, net 3.0 0.2 3.3 0.2 Other income, net includes miscellaneous income, such as income from equity accounted investees and dividends from investments, and expenses not associated with other functional areas. Income tax expense. The following tables set forth information on our income tax expense for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Income tax expense 29.4 1.7 39.3 2.3 90 Year ended December 31, 2010 2009 % % Effective Tax Rate 24.7 42.9 Our income tax expense decreased by $9.9 million, or 25.2%, to $29.4 million in 2010. Our effective tax rate differs from a combined German corporate and trade tax rate on income primarily as a result of foreign tax rate differentials, the effects of the MEP which are disregarded for tax purposes, prior year adjustments and changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. We expect, assuming other conditions do not change, that our marginal tax rate will trend towards 33% to 37%, taking into consideration the current level of earnings, the distribution of those earnings among various taxing jurisdictions, our business development based on our mid-term business plan and assuming no changes in tax laws. Net income from discontinued operations. The following table sets forth information on net income from discontinued operations for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Net income from discontinued operations 2.6 0.1 0.0 0.0 In 2010, we recorded a gain from the release of a provision in connection with a disposal as described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Net income. The following table sets forth information on net income for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Net income (loss) 92.0 5.2 52.3 3.1 We recognized net income of $92.0 million in 2010 compared to net income of $52.3 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA. The following table sets forth information on our Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. It is based on the profitability measure defined in our Senior Facilities Agreement, and we use this measure for many purposes in managing and directing our company. It is not, however, a substitute for net income or any other measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, together with other important disclosure, below under "—Special Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures." Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Adjusted EBITDA 285.0 16.2 264.1 15.6 91 Our Adjusted EBITDA increased by $20.9 million, or 7.9%, from $264.1 million in 2009 to $285.0 million in 2010. On a constant currency basis, our Adjusted EBITDA increased by 8.7% to $287.0 million in 2010. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in the revenues in our gas and our water segments and a more favorable product mix in our gas segment. This was offset in part by a decline in the profitability of our electricity segment, which was driven by lower revenues in North America and the Middle East and our ongoing investments in new products resulting in higher R&D expenses. Also the more favorable product mix in our gas segment contributed to a higher margin. Our Adjusted EBITDA is equal to our consolidated segment profit as shown in our segment results appearing below. Results of Operations by Segment in the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009. The following table sets forth operating data and segment profit for each of our three segments, gas, electricity and water. Gas Electricity Water Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 (in $ millions) Total revenues 943.8 899.8 451.5 453.1 383.9 355.9 thereof to external customers 941.4 898.1 437.7 445.1 380.2 352.0 thereof to other segments 2.3 1.7 13.8 8.0 3.7 3.9 Segment profit 230.2 204.0 55.9 60.4 35.4 30.4 We prepare our segment profitability based on our internal reporting methodology for managing our segments, assessing their results internally and allocating our internal resources. This methodology may be different than those of other companies, and you should consider this in making any comparisons with other companies. For further information regarding our segment results, see Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements. We assess the performance of our segments using the measure "segment profit." In determining segment profit, our management either adjusts for a number of items that it believes have little or no bearing on the day-to-day operating performance of our business segments or does not allocate those items to the segments. These include the categories of items that we describe in more detail below under "—Historical Factors Affecting Our Recent Results." The adjustments made to determine segment profit correlate to the adjustments we make to net income when we calculate Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis based on the definition in the Senior Facilities Agreement. We have used this measure of segment profitability due to the importance to our company of the financial covenants in the Senior Facilities Agreement. Our group management has therefore required the segments to manage their operating businesses with the financial covenants in mind. In addition, group management assumes the responsibility from an initial accountability point of view for those non-operating and other matters that it believes are more appropriately attributable to the group function. We believe this has assisted us in achieving consistency across our Group on these matters while simplifying the monitoring of their effects on our financial covenants. 92 Gas Revenues. In 2010, the revenues of our gas segment increased by $44.0 million, or 4.9%, from $899.8 million in 2009 to $943.8 million in 2010. On a constant currency basis, our revenues increased by 7.7%. The increase in our revenues was caused mainly by the improved economic environment, which led to significantly higher revenues in several regions in which we operate in the second half of 2010. Gas metering and gas utilization products benefited from the more favorable economic environment and the recovery of certain industries in the second half of 2010. This increase more than offset the revenue decline we experienced in the first six months of 2010 when sales in our gas segment were negatively affected by reduced revenues from gas infrastructure projects and lower shipments of gas utilization products. Primarily, the North American markets contributed to the positive development in 2010. In 2010, we considerably increased our revenues for residential smart meters in our gas segment, particularly through the combination of third-party AMR communication modules with our own meters. We also experienced a higher demand for our gas distribution products in most of our product lines due to an increasing demand over the depressed levels we experienced during the economic downturn in 2009 as well as an increased demand for our regulator products. In addition, the demand for our residential and industrial gas meters and gas regulator products recovered in some major markets outside North America in 2010, above all Central and Eastern Europe as well, to a lesser extent, Western Europe. In 2010, we began to record revenues from a new significant gas infrastructure project that we started and substantially completed throughout the year in Asia. The revenues from this project were higher than the revenues we earned from gas infrastructure projects in the Middle East and North Africa that we started at the beginning of 2009 and completed later that year. Furthermore, the demand for our gas utilization products, particularly for our heat-control systems improved as the industrial end-users of these products increased their capital expenditures continuously during 2010. These revenue improvements were partly offset by lower revenues in the beginning of the year due to a decline in demand for our gas utilization products from our furnace-building customers. Segment profit. Our gas segment profit increased by $26.2 million, or 12.8%, from $204.0 million in 2009 to $230.2 million in 2010. On a constant currency basis, our gas segment profit increased by 16.0%. The profit increase was driven mainly by an overall improvement in revenues and was supported by a shift towards higher margin products, higher capacity usage in the manufacturing facilities and our CIP. The improved profit was also due in part to lower general and administrative expenses, although this decline was partly offset by increased expense due to additional headcount, mainly in the manufacturing and R&D areas. The increase in our headcount was necessary due to the increase in our production capacity usage and our ongoing investments in new products. The increase in our gas segment profit was partially offset by increased R&D expenses compared to 2009 as we continued to focus on the development of new products, particularly for our Smart Offerings. We also continued our development of a new generation of ultrasonic flow meters for C&I gas applications and delivered the first units in 2010. 93 The gas segment profit includes $8.9 million in income from participations from segments of the Elster Group other than the gas segment in 2010 compared to $8.3 million in 2009. Electricity Revenues. In 2010, the revenues of our electricity segment decreased by $1.6 million, or 0.4%, to $451.5 million from $453.1 million in 2009. On a constant currency basis, our revenues decreased by 1.7%. This decrease in revenues mainly resulted from a decrease in revenues in the Middle East and North America. The first half of 2010 was negatively influenced by the uncertainty surrounding the tax status of the public funds, asset ownership, and local commission funding support, leading to delays in contracts which were to be supported by stimulus funds in the United States. Towards the end of 2010, we observed that some of our customers in North America were moving more deliberately with their evaluation processes for Smart Grid projects, creating a longer sales cycle. We ramped up of our production capabilities for components of our EnergyAxis solutions at the end of 2008 and the projects led to the high level of revenues in 2009. In the Middle East, the decrease in revenues was mainly attributable to the completion of major projects in 2009. We did not replace those revenues in 2010 with new projects. Additionally revenues were also negatively affected by our termination of the distributor relationship described above. This decrease was partly offset by higher revenues elsewhere, mainly in Western Europe, as we expanded our portfolio of Smart Offerings, largely as a result of an acquisition we completed late in 2009. To a lesser extent our electricity segment revenues were positively affected by increased sales in the Oceania region, resulting from deliveries of our Smart Offerings. In addition, we decided to adopt early an accounting policy in 2010 related to revenue recognition in sales involving the delivery of multiple elements that included software. As a result, the revenues in our electricity segment for the year ended December 31, 2010 were approximately $17.1 million higher than revenues would have been using the previous accounting policies for revenue recognition. For more information, see “—Critical Accounting Policies – Revenue Recognition.” Our revenues to other segments increased from $8.0 million to $13.8 million mainly due to higher sales of communication modules to our gas segment. Segment profit. Our electricity segment profit decreased by $4.5 million, or 7.5%, from $60.4 million in 2009 to $55.9 million in 2010. On a constant currency basis, our segment profit decreased by 9.4%. The decrease in electricity segment profit is mainly attributable to lower revenues resulting from the factors described above. In addition, our fixed structure costs increased as we continued to expand our sales force focused on marketing our Smart Offerings. As a result of our ongoing investments in new products, we incurred higher R&D expenses as well. These investments led to a further upgrade of our EnergyAxis system and to launches of new product variants of our residential and C&I electric meters. The decrease in segment profit was partly offset by increased sales of higher margin products from our expanded Smart Offerings portfolio, particularly in Western Europe. The early adoption of an accounting policy related to revenue recognition in sales contributed to our segment profit as well. 94 Water Revenues. In 2010, the revenues of the water segment increased by $28.0 million, or 7.9%, to $383.9 million from $355.9 million in 2009. On a constant currency basis, our revenues in the water segment increased by 6.5%. In 2010, we recorded higher revenues in the Middle East, where we sold predominantly residential multi-jet meters. In North America, we increased our revenues for our volumetric C&I and smart residential meters. The business in Middle East and North America was mainly impacted by major projects. We completed considerable portions of these projects in the third quarter of 2010. Our increase in revenues was supported by new product launches in our Smart Offerings and our C&I portfolio. In addition, our revenues in Asia and Oceania, where we sold increased numbers of volumetric residential products and recorded increased project revenues. Our revenues also benefited from the improved economic conditions in these regions. However, the demand in Western Europe for our residential meters was negatively impacted by a somewhat difficult economic situation in certain countries. Segment profit. The segment profit in our water segment increased by $5.0 million, or 16.4%, from $30.4 million in 2009 to $35.4 million in 2010. The segment profit margin increased by 0.7 percentage points, from 8.5% in the twelve months of 2009 to 9.2% in the year ended December 31, 2010. On a constant currency basis, our water segment profit increased by 14.1% to $34.7 million 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in segment profit was largely a result of higher revenues. The profit margin was positively impacted through our CIP initiatives to improve the efficiency of our supply chain as we further integrated sites in Europe. In 2010, we benefited from increased revenues in product groups with higher margins, such as our volumetric residential and C&I related products. However, average prices decreased slightly in some major markets which negatively impacted our profit margin. For instance, prices for our residential products in Latin America decreased due to intense price competition. Moreover, we continued to invest in our R&D activities, enhancing our Smart Offerings portfolio for North America and our residential metering product offering, mainly for European markets. We introduced new smart enabled volumetric products and enhanced our Smart Offerings water solutions in North America. In addition, we expanded our volumetric product portfolio in Europe. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Revenues. The following table presents data on our revenues for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 (in $ millions) Revenues 1,695.1 1,904.5 In 2009, our revenues decreased by $209.4 million, or 11.0%, to $1,695.1 million compared to revenues of $1,904.5 million in 2008. On a constant currency basis, our revenues declined by 6.2%. 95 The decrease in revenues was mainly driven by worldwide economic conditions, which have negatively affected the demand for our meters and other products, as our customers decreased investments and deferred decisions relating to new capital expenditures. In our gas segment, our revenues declined by $229.6 million, or 20.3% as construction of new homes in North America slowed and demand for our C&I and utilization products by industrial customers also declined. The decline was offset in part by project related investments for distribution stations and advanced C&I meters in connection with ongoing gasification projects in the Middle East and North Africa. Revenues in our electricity segment grew by $49.0 million, or 12.1%, as we recorded increased revenues from EnergyAxis systems we are deploying in North America and higher unit sales of both our residential and C&I meters. Revenues in our water segment decreased by $28.1 million, or 7.3%, as reduced levels of new construction in certain markets, such as in the United Kingdom, led to lower overall demand for our meters. The declines were offset in part by higher revenues in North America and in Western Europe mainly due to increased sales of our submetering products and our Smart Offerings. For more information on our revenue development and trends, see "— Results of Operations by Segment in the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008.” Revenues by region. The following table sets forth our revenues by region for the periods indicated. We categorize our revenues geographically based on the location to which we ship products or in which we provide services to our customers. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 (in $ millions) North America United States 448.0 440.9 Other North America 111.2 92.0 Total 559.2 532.9 International Germany 256.0 309.0 Europe outside Germany 510.5 641.3 Other 369.4 421.3 Total 1,135.9 1,371.6 Total 1,695.1 1,904.5 Cost of revenues. The following table sets forth our cost of revenues, gross profit and related data for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Cost of revenues 1,191.3 70.3 1,306.3 68.6 Gross profit 503.8 29.7 598.2 31.4 96 Our cost of revenues decreased by $115.0 million in 2009, or 8.8%, compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower revenues in our gas segment and to a lesser extent in our water segment, which reduced the direct costs of materials and related costs. Currency effects also contributed to the decrease in cost of revenues. Our gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 29.7% in 2009 from 31.4% in 2008. Several factors combined to drive this decrease in gross margin: · As a consequence of the Smart Offerings driven growth in our electricity segment, coupled with revenue declines in our gas segment due to macroeconomic conditions, we experienced a shift in our mix of products towards our electricity segment during 2009. Our electricity segment products, particularly during the design, development and expansion phases of new technologies, have been characterized by lower margins than those of our gas business. · Volatile prices for raw materials also negatively affected our gross margin. The prices we paid for raw materials, including brass, steel and aluminum, fell significantly during the second half of 2008 as a result of the global economic downturn. In an effort to reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations, we entered into supply contracts with some of our suppliers at fixed prices, in some cases before the price for these materials declined. These contracts locked us into fixed prices in early 2009 as market prices decreased. We entered into replacements for most of these contracts during the course of 2009, fixing lower supply costs for many of these raw materials. We expect to benefit from these lower contract prices if raw material prices become volatile and increase in 2010. · We incurred restructuring and employee termination expenses in 2009. As part of our initiative to improve the efficiency of our supply chain, including the outsourcing of sub-assemblies, we restructured some of our facilities, most of which were in Europe and North America. As these initiatives occurred during 2009, our gross profit does not reflect the full-year impact of the results of these restructuring activities. · Manufacturing costs represented a higher percentage of revenues in 2009 than in 2008 as a result of the decline in capacity utilization in our manufacturing facilities. · In 2008 we made significant investments in technical equipment and machinery at our sites in connection with our improvement initiatives. As a result, depreciation on manufacturing equipment increased in 2009 compared to 2008. Selling expenses. The following table sets forth information on our selling expenses for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Selling expenses 159.4 9.4 183.4 9.6 Selling expenses decreased by $24.0 million in 2009, or 13.1%, compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower variable selling expenses, such as commissions and shipping expenses mainly driven by lower overall sales volumes as well as currency effects. In addition, average freight costs declined. Cost control initiatives we implemented in early 2009, relating mostly to advertising, supplies and other miscellaneous expenses also contributed to the decline. 97 Offsetting this decline in part were increased expenses relating to our sales organization. While our overall sales headcount decreased, we have expanded the portion of our sales force, which supports our key account management organization and the opportunity management teams which we continue to build up to market our Smart Offerings and related solutions, particularly in the United States and the European Union. General and administrative expenses. The following table sets forth information on our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Management Equity Program -33.3 -2.0 90.7 4.8 Other general and administrative expenses 170.3 10.1 155.8 8.1 Total general and administrative expenses 137.0 8.1 246.5 12.9 Our general and administrative expenses decreased by $109.5 million, or 44.4%, in 2009. Our lower general and administrative expenses were primarily due to the non-cash $33.3 million gain related to the MEP. The MEP accounted for general and administrative expenses of $90.7 million in 2008. In compensation expense, we recognize amounts determined by reference to a formula-based valuation of the shares in our company under the MEP. That formula is based on our Adjusted EBITDA. Because, as discussed below, our Adjusted EBITDA declined in 2009, the valuation of the company used for the MEP also declined. Our general and administrative expenses other than those relating to the MEP increased by $14.5 million, or 9.3%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. This increase related mainly to expenses of $23.0 million that we incurred in our preparation to become a public company, as compared to expenses of $7.0 million in 2008. For more information relating to these expenses, see "—Historical Factors Affecting Our Recent Results—Expenses for Preparation to Become a Public Company." Research and development expenses. The following table sets forth information on our R&D expenses for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Research and development expenses 78.4 4.6 70.7 3.7 Our research and development expenses increased by $7.7 million, or 10.9%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. 98 We increased our R&D activities as we intensified our focus on our Smart Offerings, particularly in developing enhancements to EnergyAxis and additional functionalities for our smart meters for both use in residential and C&I context. In our electricity segment, we completed development work on a polyphase modular smart electricity meter that accommodates all existing communication modules. In our gas segment, we invested in the development of a new generation of ultrasonic flow meters for C&I gas applications. In our water segment, we continued to enhance and extend our product offering for volumetric water meters with polymer bodies. In addition, we launched a single jet water meter that is designed to deliver improved measuring performance and comes pre-equipped for communication. In connection with these activities, we increased our R&D headcount and contracted for external services, including engineering consultants and research institutes. The increase in R&D expenses was partially offset by currency effects. Other operating income (expense), net. Other operating income (expense), net mainly includes currency gains and losses. The following table sets forth information on other operating income (expense), net for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Other operating income (expense), net 14.8 0.9 -39.5 -2.1 Most of our other operating income (expense), net was comprised of currency gains of $14.4 million in 2009 and currency losses of $45.2 million in 2008. We describe these currency gains and losses below in "—Historical Factors Affecting Our Recent Results—Foreign Currency Exchange Effects." Interest expense, net. The following table sets forth information on interest expense, net for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Interest expense, net 55.4 3.3 117.3 6.2 Interest expense, net decreased in 2009 by $61.9 million, or 52.8%, from $117.3 million in 2008 to $55.4 million in 2009. This decrease resulted mainly from lower interest rates on outstanding euro-denominated floating rate amounts under our Senior Facilities Agreement as market rates declined substantially, and the repayment of debt. In addition, we exchanged most of the mandatorily redeemable preferred equity certificates into equity in December 2008. This was partially offset by increased amounts we were required to pay on interest rate swaps due to the declining interest rate environment. We incurred non-cash interest expense of $0.4 million in 2009 and of $26.4 million in 2008 in connection with our mandatorily redeemable preferred equity certificates and shareholder loan. Other income, net.

Other income, net increased by $0.4 million in 2009 compared to 2008. Income tax expense. The following tables set forth information on our income tax expense for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Income tax expense 39.3 2.3 30.9 1.6 Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % % Effective Tax Rate 42.9 -55.0 (1) (1) The negative tax rate in 2008 refers to the fact that we recorded income taxes despite having incurred a loss from continuing operations before taxes. The $30.9 million in income taxes for 2008 was equal to -55.0% of our income from continuing operations before income taxes. For the calculation of our effective tax rates, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. Our income tax expense increased by $8.4 million, or 27.2%, to $39.3 million in 2009. This amount is equal to 42.9% of income from continuing operations before income tax for 2009. In 2009, our income from continuing operations before income tax was also affected by the gain recorded in general and administrative expense as a consequence of the reduction in the MEP valuation. Our tax expenses include changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets of $12.6 million in 2009 as compared to $11.4 million in 2008 and expenses for uncertain tax positions of $8.2 million in 2009 as compared to $2.9 million in 2008.

Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Net income (loss) 52.3 3.1 -87.1 -4.6 We recognized net income of $52.3 million in 2009 after having incurred a net loss of $87.1 million in 2008. 100 Adjusted EBITDA. The following table sets forth information on our Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 in $ millions % of revenues in $ millions % of revenues Adjusted EBITDA 264.1 15.6 314.6 16.5 Our Adjusted EBITDA declined by $50.5 million, or 16.1%, from $314.6 million in 2008 to $264.1 million in 2009. On a constant currency basis, our Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 12.3% to $275.9 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily driven by overall revenue decline as well as the shift in our product mix described above from our relatively higher margin gas segment to our relatively lower margin electricity segment. The revenue driven increase in gross profit in our electricity segment was not sufficient to compensate for the decline in revenues in our gas segment. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA declined slightly as a percentage of sales by 0.9 percentage points. Our Adjusted EBITDA is equal to our consolidated segment profit as shown in our segment results appearing below. Results of Operations by Segment in the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 The following table sets forth operating data and segment profit for each of our three segments, gas, electricity and water. Gas Electricity Water Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 (in $ millions) Total revenues 899.8 1,129.4 453.1 404.1 355.9 384.0 thereof to external customers 898.1 1,127.4 445.1 395.4 352.0 381.7 thereof to other segments 1.7 2.0 8.0 8.7 3.9 2.3 Segment profit 204.0 264.1 60.4 35.0 30.4 32.3 Gas Revenues. In 2009, the revenues of our gas segment decreased by $229.6 million, or 20.3%, from $1,129.4 million in 2008 to $899.8 million in 2009. On a constant currency basis, our revenues decreased by 15.8%. The decline in our revenues was caused mainly by the worldwide economic downturn. The weak construction market in the United States during 2009 contributed to lower demand for both our residential and C&I meters, our gas distribution products and our gas regulators. The decline in our revenues was also due in part to a reduction in inventory levels, as some of our utility and distributor customers sought to reduce inventory in the face of weak demand in construction. This effect was partly offset by higher average prices for our residential meters in the United States. 101 In addition, the worldwide economic downturn negatively affected the demand for our gas utilization products as our industrial customers in the furnace engineering and machine tool industries decreased their capital expenditures in light of the economic downturn, resulting in significant volume reductions. This effect mainly impacted our revenues in Europe and Asia, where the majority of our customers for gas utilization products are located. In Western Europe, demand for our gas metering products was negatively impacted by the weak construction markets in certain countries and deferred investment decisions by utilities as they wait on adopting new technologies and wait on responding to changing regulations. In Central and Eastern Europe, demand for our residential and C&I meters also suffered as a result of declining investments by utilities in response to the economic downturn. Increased investment by our customers in gas infrastructure projects in the Middle East and North Africa partially offset this revenue decline, as distribution stations and other advanced C&I meters with communication capabilities were delivered. Segment profit. Our segment profit in gas decreased by $60.1 million, or 22.8%, from $264.1 million in 2008 to $204.0 million in 2009. The segment profit margin slightly decreased by 0.7 percentage points from 23.4% in 2008 to 22.7% in 2009. On a constant currency basis, our gas segment profit decreased to $212.3 million, or 19.6%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The segment profit of our gas segment was lower in 2009 mainly due to a shift to lower margin products. These products comprised lower margin meters and equipment delivered in the context of several distribution station projects containing a larger proportion of components that we purchased from third parties thereby reducing our own profit margin. In addition, capacity utilization was lower in 2009 than in 2008. These effects were offset in part by the results of our cost-saving initiatives in the segment and lower market prices for some raw materials for which we had not entered into fixed contracts. We improved our cost base in the gas segment through cost-saving initiatives at two sites in Germany and reducing headcount at our sites in the Unites States and in Slovakia. Our distribution and selling expenses also declined due to lower sales commissions and lower variable shipping and handling costs. In our gas segment, we increased R&D activities and retained external engineering consultants and research institutes in connection with our introduction of new products. In North America, we introduced a gas module for EnergyAxis and new types of gas regulators. Elsewhere, we introduced a new encoder for gas meters with wired communication and worked on a new generation of ultrasonic flow meters for C&I gas applications. Electricity Revenues. In 2009, the revenues of our electricity segment increased by $49.0 million, or 12.1%, from $404.1 million in 2008 to $453.1 million. On a constant currency basis, our revenues increased by 16.4%. The increase in revenues in our electricity segment was primarily driven by the increase in our Smart Offerings, mainly from deployments in North America. In the United States, we deployed EnergyAxis systems, including residential and C&I smart meters for electricity utilities and multi-utilities, under contracts with, among others, Arizona Public Service Company, Salt River Project in Arizona, Black Hills and several mid-sized utilities. We also deployed EnergyAxis systems in several regions in Canada and Central America. Outside North America, we recorded higher revenues in the Middle East, mainly due to one large order of smart meters. Our revenues also increased in Western Europe, in part due to investments in the energy infrastructure. To that end, we are engaged in more than a dozen Smart Offerings pilot projects in the European Union. 102 The increase in our revenues was offset in part by lower sales in Eastern and Central Europe, which were negatively affected by the economic downturn. In these regions, demand for our C&I meters declined as utilities decreased investment and deferred decisions relating to new capital expenditures. In Latin America, our revenues declined largely due to decreased sales of manual-read meters in response to the economic downturn. Segment profit. Our segment profit in electricity increased by $25.4 million, or 72.6%, from $35.0 million in 2008 to $60.4 million in 2009. The segment profit margin increased by 4.6 percentage points from 8.7% in 2008 to 13.3% in 2009. On a constant currency basis, our segment profit was $62 million in 2009, an increase of 77.1% compared to 2008. The increase in our segment profit reflected higher margins, due in large part to a more favorable product mix among our electricity products year to year, particularly in North America. In addition, we improved utilization of capacity at our Raleigh, North Carolina site where we ramped up production of our new REX 2 residential meter. We also introduced various improvements to our design production and engineering and implemented several procurement initiatives. These positive impacts were offset in part by a reduction in volumes of our higher margin C&I meters in Eastern and Central Europe. In addition, we incurred higher costs, as a substantial portion of the sales force expansion we describe above took place in the electricity segment. We also incurred higher R&D expense in our electricity segment in connection with the R&D initiatives previously described. Water Revenues. In 2009, the revenues of the water segment decreased by $28.1 million, or 7.3%, from $384.0 million in 2008 to $355.9 million in 2009. On a constant currency basis, our revenues in water decreased by 1.2%. Our revenues were mainly affected by the worldwide economic downturn, as we recorded lower sales due to weaker construction demand in our key markets, such as the United Kingdom. In addition, we experienced lower sales volume in the Middle East. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales in North America despite challenging market conditions, mainly driven by the reorganization of our sales activities, our modified product offering and to a lesser degree various pilots of our Smart Offerings for water, including our Evolution product line. We also partially offset the decline in revenues in Western Europe with increased sales of our submetering products and Smart Offerings. Segment profit. The segment profit in our water segment decreased by $1.9 million, or 5.9%, from $32.3 million in 2008 to $30.4 million in 2009. The segment profit margin increased by 0.1 percentage points from 8.4% in 2008 to 8.5% in 2009. On a constant currency basis, our water segment profit was $33.0 million, an increase of 2.2% in 2009 compared to 2008. The slight decrease in segment profit was largely a result of lower revenues. In addition, although we were not able to benefit from the full effect of the decrease of average raw material prices for brass and bronze in 2009 due to fixed-price contracts we had entered into earlier, we reduced our dependence on these raw materials with the introduction of our latest generation of polymer meters, which reduces cost and limits exposure to market price volatility. Our structural costs benefited from several restructuring projects including the rationalization of our operations in Latin America and in United Kingdom. We centralized our manufacturing lines in Central Europe and continued outsourcing certain non-core processes. 103 Our R&D expenses declined slightly between 2008 and 2009. We invested in enhancing our smart meter water solution for the United States and other markets. In addition we introduced a new residential volumetric meter that incorporates polymer materials. In 2009, we also launched a new single jet meter with improved measuring performance that is pre-equipped for AMR functionality. Historical Factors Affecting Our Recent Results Our results in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were significantly affected by a number of factors relating to our corporate history, measures we have taken to transform our company and our preparation to become a public company. The factors we describe below are those that we have taken into account in calculating our Adjusted EBITDA, which we describe in more detail below, and are the items that our management does not allocate to the segments in calculating segment profit. These factors are: · foreign currency exchange effects; · the management equity program, or MEP; · expenses for our preparation to become a public company; · employee termination and exit costs; · business process reengineering and reorganization costs; · IT project costs; · gain from sales of real estate; · strategy development costs; · business combination costs; · impairment of intangible assets; · effects of termination of a distributor; and · other items. Foreign Currency Exchange Effects As a result of our international operations, we are subject to risks associated with the fluctuations of foreign currencies against other foreign currencies. This affects our financial statements and results of operations in various ways. 104 · As part of our consolidation each period, we translate the financial statements of those entities in our group that have functional currencies other than the dollar into dollars at the period-end exchange rates (in the case of balance sheet items) and the average exchange rates for the period (in the case of statement of operations items). The translated values in respect of each entity fluctuate over time with the movement of the exchange rate for the entity's functional currency against the dollar. We refer to this as the currency translation effect. It is not practicable to hedge against this risk. · Most of our group companies make their purchases and sales primarily in their respective functional currencies. However, entities within the group make sometimes purchases and sales denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. To the extent that an entity makes purchases in a currency that appreciates against its functional currency, its cost basis expressed in its functional currency will increase, or decrease, if the other currency depreciates against its functional currency. Similarly, for sales in a currency other than the entity's functional currency, its revenues will increase to the extent that the other currency appreciates against the entity's functional currency and decrease to the extent that currency depreciates against the entity's functional currency. These movements can have a material effect on the gross margin of the entity concerned and on our consolidated gross margin. · After a purchase or sale is completed, the currency transaction effect continues to affect foreign currency accounts payable and accounts receivable on the books of those entities that made purchases or sales in a foreign currency. These entities are required to remeasure these balances at market exchange rates at the end of each period. In 2008, we incurred a foreign currency loss of $7.4 million resulting from these remeasurements; in 2009 we recognized a gain of $2.9 million and in 2010, we incurred a gain of $2.3 million. We intend, through our group treasury function, to enter into foreign currency derivative financial products to mitigate exchange rate losses when the appropriate financial products are available on attractive terms. However, it is often economically disadvantageous to pay the costs associated with hedging against every possible currency movement, particularly between currencies that have traditionally been rather stable, and we will continue to be subject to this risk. In addition to these exposures, we were also exposed to the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates in connection with our financing arrangements, in particular those arising out of the multi-currency borrowing facilities we have drawn upon under our Senior Facilities Agreement. Under our Senior Facilities Agreement, we initially made drawings through our U.K. subsidiary denominated in both euro and pounds sterling. With respect to the U.K. subsidiary's euro-denominated drawing and because the functional currency of the U.K. subsidiary is the pound sterling, that subsidiary was required to mark changes in the value of its euro-denominated liability to the banks to the market value of the euro, expressed in pounds sterling, periodically as the exchange rate of euro for pounds sterling changed. With respect to the pound sterling-denominated drawing, in 2008, Elster Holdings GmbH made an inter-company loan, denominated in pounds sterling, to its U.K. subsidiary in an amount that permitted the U.K. subsidiary to repay parts of the pound sterling-denominated tranche of the Senior Facilities Agreement it had drawn. As a consequence, Elster Holdings GmbH was required to mark the changes in value of its pound sterling-denominated loan to its U.K. subsidiary to the market value of the euro, expressed in pounds sterling, periodically as the exchange rate of euro for pounds sterling changes. These attributes of our group financing structure led us to recognize a foreign exchange rate gain of $0.6 million in 2010 and of $11.5 million in 2009 and foreign exchange rate loss of $37.8 million in 2008. 105 In order to reduce the volume of foreign currency exposure at the level of the U.K. subsidiary (with respect to that subsidiary's euro-denominated debt) and at the level of Elster Holdings GmbH (with respect to its pound sterling-denominated inter-company loan to the U.K. subsidiary), our U.K. subsidiary sold three of its subsidiaries in 2009 and 2010, located in Spain, South Africa and Australia, to Elster Holdings GmbH as part of a project to simplify our legal structure for an aggregate consideration of €65.6 million. Following the IPO $53.8 million of the amounts outstanding under our Senior Facilities Agreement have been repaid of which $9.6 million were related to a repayment of the pound sterling tranche and $44.2 million were related to the repayment of the euro-denominated tranches. The following table sets forth the foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from these assets and liabilities in the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in $ millions) Gains (losses) related to financing 0.6 11.5 -37.8 Gains (losses) related to accounts receivable and payable 2.3 2.9 -7.4 Foreign currency exchange effects 2.9 14.4 -45.2 Management Equity Program In November 2006, we and Rembrandt created our Management Equity Program, or MEP, as a measure to align interests between our key management personnel, our shareholders and our company. In our accounting for the effects of the MEP, we have recalculated the value of our company, using the index described in "Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—The Management KG and Our Management Equity Program—The Management Equity Program", as of the end of each financial period. To the extent the formula-based value, so determined, had changed, we recognized a corresponding item in our compensation expense, included in our general and administrative expenses, and made a corresponding adjustment to the additional paid-in capital of the company. If a periodic valuation showed an increase in value, we recorded compensation expense and an increase in our additional paid-in capital, and if the periodic valuation showed a decline in value, we showed an income item in compensation expense and a reduction in our additional paid-in capital. There were no cash outflows for our company associated with the MEP. The following table sets forth the impact on compensation expense relating to our MEP in the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in $ millions) Management Equity Program -13.6 -33.3 90.7 106 These periodic revaluations and the related recognition of compensation expense or income in respect of the MEP continued through the date of the IPO. After the IPO, we were no longer be required to recognize any charges or income in respect of the MEP. Accordingly, September 30, 2010 was the last measurement date. On September 30, 2010, we recognized a MEP-related compensation gain in general and administrative expenses. Because a market price for our shares was established at the time of our IPO, the public offering price for the IPO, or $13 per ADS, was used to determine the valuation of our company for purposes of the final recognition of accumulated compensation expense in respect of the MEP. Based upon the initial offering price of $13 per ADS, we recognized a gain in general and administrative expenses of $13.6 million in 2010. Expenses for Preparation to Become a Public Company Our company was formed through the purchase by private equity funds and related investors (including the members of management and others who participate in the Management KG) of business units from E.ON Ruhrgas AG. After our formation and the decision to focus on the metering business, we began taking measures designed to ensure our ability to operate as an independent company and, in connection with the IPO, as a public company. The following table summarizes these expenses for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in $ millions) Expenses for Preparation to Become a Public Company 12.7 23.0 7.0 We have incurred costs to enhance our systems of internal controls in light of the requirements applicable to public companies with respect to disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting. These costs related mostly to improvements in our internal audit processes and for the documentation of internal controls as well as to enhancements to our IT systems and our financial processes. The costs for the conversion of financial reporting related to our decision to begin preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and consisted of consulting fees, costs for the modification of our financial reporting system to enable the preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements and the additional audit fees we paid in respect of the comparative periods. Corporate relocation and governance costs mainly encompass fees for tax and legal advice in connection with the relocation of Elster Group SE from Luxembourg to Germany, the establishment of a corporate governance structure suitable for a public company and the costs for the preparation of our IPO as well as the cost to prepare for our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2008, we also incurred fees, mainly tax and legal fees, in connection with the recapitalization of the Company we describe in "
