ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect our Company. Risks Relating to Our Business Our revenue growth is substantially dependent on our successful development and release of new products. Maintaining or growing our revenue will depend on our ability to timely develop new products for existing and new markets that meet customers performance, reliability and price requirements. The development of new products is a highly complex process, and we have in the past and may in the future experience delays and failures in completing the development and introduction of new products. Our successful product development depends on a number of factors, including the following:  the accurate prediction of market requirements, changes in technology and evolving standards;  the availability of qualified product designers and process technologies needed to solve difficult design challenges in a cost-effective, reliable manner;  our ability to design products that meet customers cost, size and performance requirements;  our ability to manufacture new products according to customer needs with acceptable manufacturing yields;  our ability to offer new products at competitive prices;  the acceptance by customers of our new product designs;  the identification of and entry into new markets for our products;  the acceptance of our customers products by the market and the lifecycle of such products;  our ability to deliver products in a timely manner within our customers product planning and deployment cycle; and  our ability to maintain and increase our level of product content in our customers systems. A new product design effort may last 12 to 18 months or longer, and requires significant investments in engineering hours and materials, as well as sales and marketing expenses, which will not be recouped if the product launch is unsuccessful. We may not be able to design and introduce new products in a timely or cost-efficient manner, and our new products may fail to meet the requirements of the market or our customers, or may be adopted by customers slower than we expect. In that case, we may not reach our expected level of production orders and may lose market share, which could adversely affect our ability to sustain our revenue growth or maintain our current revenue levels. Various factors may reduce our gross margin, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to utilize our design, fabrication, assembly and test facilities at a high level, the significant fixed costs associated with these facilities may not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margin. Our various products have different gross margin and increased sales of lower-margin products, such as our products targeted at automotive and other consumer markets, in a given period relative to sales of higher-margin products such as our optical products, may cause us to report lower overall gross margin. In our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and at other times in the past, we have experienced periods where our gross margin declined due to, among other things, reduced factory utilization resulting from reduced customer demand, reduced selling prices and a change in product mix towards lower-margin products. Future market 15 Table of Contents conditions may adversely affect our revenue and utilization rates and consequently our future gross margin, and this, in turn, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased raw material costs, changes in manufacturing yields, more complex engineering requirements and other factors may lead to lower margins for us in the future. As a result of these or other factors, we may be unable to maintain or increase our gross margin in future periods and our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period. We may not meet investors quarterly or annual financial expectations and, as a result, our stock price may decline. Our quarterly and annual operating results and related expectations may vary significantly in the future based upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors that could cause operating results and related expectations to fluctuate include:  the general economic growth or decline in the U.S. or foreign markets;  the reduction or cancellation of orders by customers, whether as a result of a loss of market share by us or our customers, changes in the design of customers products or slowing demand for our products or customers products;  the amount of new customer orders we both book and ship in any particular fiscal quarter, which accounts for a significant amount of our net revenue in any particular quarter, and which can often be weighted toward the latter part of each fiscal quarter, making the timing of recognition of the associated revenue difficult to forecast with fidelity and susceptible to slippage between quarters;  the relative linearity of our shipments within any particular fiscal quarter, in that a less linear shipment pattern within a given fiscal quarter tends to result in lower gross margin in that quarter, and a shipment pattern weighted toward the latter part of a fiscal quarter tends to reduce our cash flows from operations in that quarter, as collections of related receivables do not occur until later fiscal periods;  the gain or loss of a key customer or significant changes in the financial condition of one or more key customers;  the fluctuations in manufacturing output, yields, capacity levels, quality control or other potential problems or delays we or our subcontractors may experience in the fabrication, assembly, testing or delivery of our products;  the fluctuations in demand relating to the A&D market due to changes in government programs, budgets or procurement;  the market acceptance of our products and particularly the timing and success of new product and technology introductions by us, customers or competitors;  the amount, timing, and relative success of our investments in research and development, which impacts our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and solutions on a timely basis;  the period-to-period changes in the mix of products we sell, which can result in lower gross margin;  the availability, quality and cost of semiconductor wafers and other raw materials, equipment, components and internal or outsourced manufacturing, packaging and test capacity, particularly where we have only one qualified source of supply;  the effects of seasonal and other changes in customer purchasing cycles and component inventory levels;  the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products;  the effects of impairment charges associated with intangible assets, including goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets; 16 Table of Contents  the loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers;  the effects of factors that could cause our reported domestic and foreign income taxes and income tax rate to increase in future periods, such as limits on our ability to utilize net operating losses or tax credits and the geographic distribution of our income, which may change from period to period; and  the effects of war, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, macroeconomic uncertainty or decline or geopolitical unrest. The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual operating results and related expectations for future periods. In addition, if our operating results in any period do not meet our publicly stated guidance, if any, or the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our stock price may decline. Similarly, any publicly stated guidance we provide in the future may itself fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, and our stock price may decline as a result. If our primary markets decline or fail to grow, our revenue and profitability may suffer. Our future growth depends to a significant extent on the continued growth in usage of advanced electronic systems in our primary markets: Networks, A&D, Automotive and Multi-market. The rate and extent to which these markets grow, if at all, is uncertain. These markets may fail to grow or decline for many reasons, including insufficient consumer demand, lack of access to capital, sequestration or other changes in the U.S. defense budget and procurement processes, changes in regulatory environments, macro-economic factors and changes in network specifications. If demand for electronic systems in which our products are incorporated declines, fails to grow, or grows more slowly than we anticipate, purchases of our products may be reduced, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, our sales to Ford, which accounted for 19.0% of our revenue for fiscal year 2014 and substantially all of the revenue in our Automotive market, are dependent upon the health of the automotive industry, Fords ability to maintain or grow its market share, Fords continuing to source parts from us for its current platforms, lack of success by potential competitors in displacing us and Fords continuing to design our products into its automotive platforms as they evolve, none of which are assured. We may be unable to close the BinOptics Acquisition or successfully integrate the business and personnel of BinOptics, and may not realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of the BinOptics Acquisition. On November 17, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire BinOptics. The BinOptics Acquisition is subject to various conditions to closing and may not close. If the BinOptics Acquisition does not close, we will have expended significant time and resources and we will not realize the expected benefits from the transaction. We also may not realize the expected benefits from the BinOptics Acquisition after closing because of integration difficulties or other challenges. The success of the BinOptics Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated synergies and other benefits from integrating the BinOptics business with our existing businesses. The integration process may be complex, costly, and time-consuming. The potential difficulties we may face in integrating the operations of the BinOptics business include, among others:  failure to implement our business plan for the combined business and expand BinOptics production capacity as planned;  unexpected losses of key employees, customers or suppliers of BinOptics;  unanticipated issues in conforming BinOptics standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;  coordinating new product and process development; 17 Table of Contents  increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;  diversion of managements attention from other business concerns;  adverse effects on our or BinOptics existing business relationships;  unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;  operating risks inherent in BinOptics business and operations;  unanticipated expenses and liabilities;  unfamiliarity with BinOptics technology, products and markets, including the high-performance, high-speed laser market generally, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; and  other difficulties in the assimilation of BinOptics operations, technologies, products and systems. BinOptics may have unanticipated or larger than anticipated liabilities for patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, taxes and other known and unknown types of liabilities. There may be liabilities that we underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of these entities. We have limited recourse under the merger agreement to recover damages relating to the liabilities of BinOptics and its subsidiaries. We may not be able to maintain or increase the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each of BinOptics and us had achieved or might achieve separately. In addition, we may not accomplish the integration of the BinOptics business smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe. If we experience difficulties with the integration process or if the BinOptics business deteriorates, the anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other synergies of the BinOptics Acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. If any of the above risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted, we may fail to meet the expectations of investors or analysts, and our stock price may decline as a result. We typically depend on orders from a limited number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue. In fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, sales to our distributor Richardson and to Ford each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. Sales to our top 10 direct and distribution customers accounted for an aggregate of 60%, 59% and 55%, respectively, of our revenue. While the composition of our top 10 customers varies from year to year, we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future. The purchasing arrangements with our customers are typically conducted on a purchase order basis that does not require our customers to purchase any minimum amount of our products over a period of time. As a result, it is possible that any of our major customers could terminate their purchasing arrangements with us or significantly reduce or delay the amount of our products that they order, purchase products from our competitors or develop their own products internally. The loss of, or a reduction in, orders from any major customer could cause a decline in revenue and adversely affect our results of operations. Our investment in research and development may not be successful, which may impact our profitability. The semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products. Research and development expenses were $73.7 million, $44.6 million and $36.8 million for our fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In each of the last three fiscal years, we invested in research and development as part of our strategy toward the development of innovative products and solutions to fuel our growth and profitability. We cannot assure you if or when the products and solutions where we have focused our research and development expenditures will become commercially successful. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in 18 Table of Contents research and development required to remain competitive or succeed in our strategy. Our efforts to develop new and improved process technologies for use in our products require substantial expenditures that may not generate any return on investment, may take longer than we anticipate to generate a return or may generate a return on investment that is inadequate. In July 2013, we announced that we had licensed 0.5, 0.25 and 0.15 micron GaN process technology from Global Communications Semiconductors, LLC (GCS) and would be installing such process technology to our Lowell, Massachusetts manufacturing facility. This installation effort is expected to be a multi-year process and to involve tens of millions of dollars of investment in capital equipment, license fees and other related costs and expenses. We have in the past and may in the future experience unexpected difficulties, expenses, or delays in installing and qualifying this GaN technology, and ultimately, may not be successful in our efforts, may not realize the competitive advantage we anticipate from the license and porting effort, and may not realize customer demand for the GaN technology that meets our expectations following the installation effort, any of which could lead to reduced revenues and gross margin or otherwise harm our business. Similarly, following the Nitronex Acquisition we have announced a number of strategic plans and positive expectations concerning the future cost structure, manufacturability, market applicability and potential positive impact on our market share of another type of GaN technology called GaN-on-Silicon, which is a focus of Nitronexs business. We may experience unexpected difficulties, expenses or delays in driving the scale manufacturing, decreased manufacturing cost structure, productization or customer adoption of GaN of any type that we are targeting, and ultimately may not be successful in our efforts, may not realize the competitive advantage or revenues or profits we anticipate from this technology, any of which could lead to reduced revenues and gross margin or otherwise harm our business. We may incur significant risk and expense in attempting to win new business, and such efforts may never generate revenue. To obtain new business, we often need to win a competitive selection process to develop semiconductors for use in our customers systems, known in the industry as a design win. These competitive selection processes can be lengthy and can require us to incur significant and unreimbursed design and development expenditures and dedicate scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures and selling, general and administrative expenses. Failure to obtain a design win sometimes prevents us from supplying components for an entire generation of a customers system. This can result in lost or foregone revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes. Even when we achieve a design win, success is not assured. Customer qualification and design cycles can be lengthy, and it may take a year or more following a successful design win and product qualification for one of our products to be purchased in volume by the customer. We may experience difficulties manufacturing the part in volume, such as low yields, supply chain delays or shortages, or quality issues. Further, while the customer has successfully qualified our part for use in its system when it awards a design win to us, it may not have qualified all of the other components being sourced for its system, or qualified its system as a whole with its end customers. Any difficulties our customer may experience in completing those qualifications may delay or prevent us from translating the design win into revenue. These risks can be particularly acute in our A&D market, where we may spend material amounts and commit substantial design engineer resources to product development work in support of an OEM customers attempt to win business tied to a government contract award, but realize no related revenue or less than expected revenue from that investment based on failure of the OEM to win the business, government program cancellation, federal budget limitations, or otherwise. Any of these events, or any cancellation of a customers program or failure of our customer to successfully market its own product after our design win could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as we may have incurred significant expense and generated no revenue. 19 Table of Contents We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. Our profitability will decline if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand when managing inventory. We generally sell our products on the basis of purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Our customers can typically cancel purchase orders or defer product shipments for some period without incurring liability to us. We typically plan production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which can be highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially, leading to excess inventory write-downs, and resulting negative impacts on gross margin and net income. We have limited visibility into our customers inventories, future customer demand, and the product mix that our customers will require, which could adversely affect our production forecasts and operating margins. In a number of markets we serve, large dollar value customer orders scheduled for delivery in the current fiscal quarter may be canceled or rescheduled by the customer for delivery in a future fiscal quarter on short notice, which could cause our reported revenue to vary materially from our prior expectations. In addition, the rapid pace of innovation in our industry could render significant portions of our inventory obsolete. If we overestimate our customers requirements, we may have excess inventory, which could lead to obsolete inventory and unexpected costs. Conversely, if we underestimate our customers requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could lead to foregone revenue opportunities, loss of potential market share and damage to customer relationships as product deliveries may not be made on a timely basis, disrupting our customers production schedules. Some of our larger customers also require us to build and maintain minimum inventories and keep them available for purchase at specified locations based on non-binding demand estimates that are subject to change, which exposes us to increased inventory risk and makes it more difficult to manage our working capital. If demand from such customers decreases, we may be left with excess or obsolete inventory we are unable to sell. In response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from outside suppliers and foundries, we periodically order materials and build a stock of finished goods inventory in advance of customer demand. This advance ordering of raw material and building of finished goods inventory has in the past and may in the future result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write-downs if expected orders fail to materialize, or other factors make our products less saleable. In addition, any significant future cancellation or deferral of product orders could adversely affect our revenue and margins, increase inventory write-downs due to obsolete inventory, and adversely affect our operating results and stock price. The average selling prices of our products may decrease over time, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margin. It is common in our industry for the average selling price of a given product to decrease over time as production volumes increase, competing products are developed, technology, industry standards and customer platforms evolve, or new technologies featuring higher performance or lower cost emerge. To combat the negative effects that erosion of average selling prices have had in the past and may in the future have on our revenue and gross margin, we attempt to actively manage the prices of our existing products and introduce new process technologies and products in the market that exhibit higher performance, new features that are in demand, or lower manufacturing cost. Despite this strategy, we may experience price erosion in select product platforms or generally in future periods. Failure to maintain our current prices or to successfully execute on our new product development strategy will cause our revenue and gross margin to decline, which could decrease the value of your investment in our common stock. We face intense competition in our industry, and our inability to compete successfully could negatively affect our operating results. The semiconductor industry is highly competitive. While we compete with a wide variety of companies, we compete with ADI across most of our primary markets. Our other significant competitors include, among others, Avago, Cobham, Microsemi, RFMD, Skyworks and TriQuint. We believe future competition could also come from companies developing new alternative technologies, component suppliers based in countries with lower production costs and IC manufacturers achieving higher 20 Table of Contents levels of integration that exceed the functionality offered by our products. Our customers and suppliers could also develop products that compete with or replace our products. A decision by any of our large customers to design and manufacture ICs internally could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Increased competition could mean lower prices for our products, reduced demand for our products, and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development, engineering and manufacturing costs. Many of our existing and potential competitors have entrenched market positions, historical affiliations with original equipment manufacturers, considerable internal manufacturing capacity, established intellectual property rights, and substantial technological capabilities. Many of them may also have greater financial, technical, manufacturing or marketing resources than we do. Prospective customers may decide not to buy from us due to concerns about our relative size, financial stability or other factors. Our failure to successfully compete could result in lower revenue, decreased profitability and a lower stock price. We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to significant downturns. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, product obsolescence, evolving standards, short product lifecycles and significant fluctuations in supply and demand. The industry has historically experienced significant fluctuations in demand and product obsolescence, resulting in product overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Downturns in many sectors of the electronic systems industry have in the past contributed to extended periods of weak demand for semiconductor products. We have experienced adverse effects on our profitability and cash flows during such downturns in the past, and our business may be similarly harmed by any downturns in the future, particularly if we are unable to effectively respond to reduced demand in a particular market. We expect to make future acquisitions, dispositions and investments, which involve numerous risks. We have an active corporate development program and routinely evaluate potential acquisitions of, and investments with or other strategic alliances involving, complementary technologies, design teams, products, and companies. We also may evaluate the merits of a potential divestment of one or more of our existing business lines. We expect to pursue such transactions if appropriate opportunities arise. However, we may not be able to identify suitable transactions in the future, or if we do identify such transactions, we may not be able to complete them on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. We also face intense competition for acquisitions from other acquirers in our industry. These competing acquirers may have significantly greater financial and other resources than us, which may prevent us from successfully pursuing a transaction. In the event we pursue acquisitions, we will face numerous risks including:  difficulties in integrating the personnel, culture, operations, technology or products and service offerings of the acquired company;  diversion of managements attention from normal daily operations of our business;  difficulties in entering markets where competitors have stronger market positions;  difficulties in improving and integrating the financial reporting capabilities and operating systems of any acquired operations, particularly foreign and formerly private operations, as needed to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls, and procedures;  loss of any key personnel of the acquired company as well as their know-how, relationships and expertise, which is common following an acquisition;  maintaining customer, supplier or other favorable business relationships of acquired operations;  generating insufficient revenue from completed acquisitions to offset increased expenses associated with any abandoned or completed acquisitions; 21 Table of Contents  acquiring material or unknown leasehold, environmental, regulatory, infringement, contractual or other liabilities associated with any acquired operations;  litigation frequently associated with merger and acquisition transactions; and  increasing expense associated with amortization or depreciation of intangible and tangible assets we acquire. Our past acquisitions required or continue to require significant management time and attention relating to the transaction and integration activities. If we fail to properly integrate these acquired companies with ours, we may not receive the expected benefits of the acquisitions. Even if a proposed acquisition is successfully realized and integrated, we may not receive the expected benefits of the transaction. Past transactions, whether completed or abandoned by us, have resulted, and in the future may result, in significant costs, expenses, liabilities and charges to earnings. The accounting treatment for any acquisition may result in significant amortizable intangible assets which, when amortized, will negatively affect our consolidated results of operations. The accounting treatment for any acquisition may result in significant goodwill, which, if impaired, will negatively affect our consolidated results of operations. Furthermore, we may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions. The incurrence of indebtedness could limit our operating flexibility and be detrimental to our profitability, and the issuance of equity securities would be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Any or all of the above factors may differ from the investment communitys expectations in a given quarter, which could negatively affect our stock price. In addition, as a result of the foregoing, we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions in the future to the same extent as we have the in the past, if at all. In the event we make future investments, the investments may decline in value or fail to deliver any strategic benefits we anticipate from them, and we may lose all or part of our investment. In the event we undertake divestments, we may suffer from associated management distraction, damaged customer relationships, failure to realize the perceived strategic, or financial merits of the divestment, or we may incur material indemnity liabilities to the purchaser. Further, the investments may have unanticipated or larger than anticipated liabilities for patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, taxes and other known and unknown types of liabilities. There may be liabilities that we underestimate or do not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of the investment. We may not have recourse under the transaction documents to recover any damages relating to potential liabilities. We may incur liabilities for claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our products. The semiconductor industry is generally subject to frequent litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other companies in the industry have numerous patents that protect their intellectual property rights in these areas, and have made in the past and may make in the future, claims that we have infringed or misappropriated their intellectual property rights. Our customers may assert claims against us for indemnification if they receive claims alleging that their or our products infringe others intellectual property rights, and have in the past and may in the future choose not to purchase our products based on their concerns over such a pending claim. In the event of an adverse result of any intellectual property rights litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages for infringement, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, incur material liability for royalty payments or fees to obtain licenses to the technology covered by the litigation or be subjected to an injunction, which could prevent us from selling our products, and materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Negotiated settlements resolving such claims may require us to pay substantial sums, as was the case in September 2013 when we paid $7.25 million in settlement of a suit alleging intellectual property misappropriation. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in any such non-infringing development or that any such license would be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lost sales, or damaged customer relationships and diversion of managements attention and resources. 22 Table of Contents We depend on third parties for products and services required for our business, which may limit our ability to meet customer demand, assure product quality and control costs. We purchase numerous raw materials, such as ceramic packages, precious metals, semiconductor wafers and ICs, from a limited number of external suppliers. We also currently use several external manufacturing suppliers for assembly and testing of our products, and in some cases for fully-outsourced turnkey manufacturing of our products. We currently expect to increase our use of outsourced manufacturing in the future as a strategy. The ability and willingness of our external suppliers to perform is largely outside of our control. The use of external suppliers involves a number of risks, including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key components, the lack of control over delivery schedules, capacity constraints, manufacturing yields, quality and fabrication costs and misappropriation of our intellectual property. If these vendors processes vary in reliability or quality, they could negatively affect our products and, therefore, our customer relations and results of operations. We generally purchase raw materials on a purchase order basis and we do not have significant long-term supply commitments from our vendors. Where we do have long-term supply commitments, they may result in our being obligated to purchase more material than we need, materially and negatively impacting our operating results. In terms of relative bargaining power, many of our suppliers are larger than we are, with greater resources, and many of their other customers are larger and have greater resources than we do. If these vendors experience shortages or fail to accurately predict customer demand, they may have insufficient capacity to meet our demand, creating a capacity constraint on our business. They may also choose to supply others in preference to us in times of capacity constraint or otherwise, particularly where the other customers purchase in higher volume. Third-party supplier capacity constraints have in the past and may in the future prevent us from supplying customer demand that we otherwise could have fulfilled at attractive prices. If we have a firm commitment to supply our customer but are unable to do so based on inability or unwillingness of one of our suppliers to provide related materials or services, we may be liable for resulting damages and expense incurred by our customer. Based on superior performance features, cost parameters or other factors, we utilize sole source suppliers for certain semiconductor packages and other materials, and it is common for one of our outside semiconductor foundries to be our sole supplier for the particular semiconductor fabrication process technologies manufactured at that suppliers facility. Such supplier concentrations involve the risk of a potential future business interruption if the supplier becomes unable or unwilling to supply us at any point. While in some cases alternate suppliers may exist, because there are limited numbers of third-party wafer suppliers that use the process technologies we select for our products and that have sufficient capacity to meet our needs, it may not be possible or may be expensive to find an alternative source of supply. Even if we are able to find an alternative source, moving production to an alternative supplier requires an extensive qualification or re-qualification process that could prevent or delay product shipments, or disrupt customers production schedules, which could harm our business. In addition, some of our external foundry suppliers compete against us in the market in addition to being our supplier. The loss of a supplier can also significantly harm our business and operating results. A supplier may discontinue supplying us if its business is not sufficiently profitable, for competitive reasons or otherwise. We have in the past and may in the future have our supply relationship discontinued by an external foundry, causing us to experience supply chain disruption, customer dissatisfaction, loss of business and increased cost. If we lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain key personnel, we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products. We believe our continued ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate highly-skilled engineering, operations, sales, administrative and managerial personnel is key to our future success. Competition for these employees is intense, particularly with respect to qualified engineers. Our failure to retain our present employees and hire additional qualified personnel in a timely manner and on reasonable terms could harm our competitiveness and results of operations. In addition, from time to time, we may recruit and hire employees from our competitors, customers, suppliers and distributors, which could result in liability to us, and has in the past and could in the 23 Table of Contents future, damage our business relationship with these parties. None of our senior management team is contractually bound to remain with us for a specified period, and we generally do not maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management. The loss of any member of our senior management team could strengthen a competitor or harm our ability to implement our business strategy. Sources for certain components and materials are limited, which could result in interruptions, delays, or reductions in product shipments. Our industry may be affected from time to time by limited supplies of certain key components and materials. We have in the past and may in the future, experience delays or reductions in supply shipments, which could reduce our revenue and profitability. If key components or materials are unavailable, our costs could increase and our revenue could decline. In particular, our manufacturing headquarters, design facilities, assembly and test facilities, and supply chain, and those of our contract manufacturers, are subject to risk of catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, or other natural or man-made disasters. The majority of our semiconductor products are fabricated in our Lowell, Massachusetts headquarters, where our only internal wafer fab is located. The majority of the internal and outsourced assembly and test facilities we utilize are located in the Pacific Rim, and some of our internal design, assembly and test facilities are located in California regions with above average seismic and severe weather activity. In addition, our research and development personnel are concentrated in a few locations, primarily our headquarters, Santa Clara, California, Sydney, Australia, Belfast, Northern Ireland and Cork, Ireland locations, with the expertise of the personnel at each such location generally focused on one or two specific areas. Any catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of these facilities would likely disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the facility, and in some instances, could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or primary market, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. For example, in October 2011, heavy monsoon rains in Thailand caused widespread flooding affecting major cities and industrial parks where there is a concentration of semiconductor manufacturing, assembly and test sites. One of our contract manufacturing suppliers located in Thailand was affected by the flooding and, as a result of the flooding of our affected contract manufacturer, $2.7 million of orders that were scheduled for shipment to our customers in the three months ended December 30, 2011 were delayed into the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, or were canceled. In particular, any catastrophic loss at our headquarters facility would materially and adversely affect our business and financial results, revenue and profitability. Our failure to continue to keep pace with new or improved semiconductor process technologies could impair our competitive position. Semiconductor manufacturers constantly seek to develop new and improved semiconductor process technologies. Our future success depends in part upon our ability to continue to gain access to these semiconductor process technologies, internally or externally, in order to adapt to emerging customer requirements and competitive market conditions. We may be unable to internally develop such technologies successfully, and may be unable to gain access to them from merchant foundries or other sources on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail for any reason to remain abreast of new and improved semiconductor process technologies as they emerge, we may lose market share and our revenue and gross margin may decline, which could adversely affect our operating results. Minor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss or even cause halts in production, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margin. Our products involve complexities in both their design and the semiconductor process technology employed in their fabrication. In many cases, the products are also assembled in customized packages or feature high levels of integration. Our products must meet exacting customer specifications for quality, performance and reliability. 24 Table of Contents Our manufacturing yield, or the percentage of units of a given product in a given period that is usable relative to all such units produced, is a combination of yields including wafer fabrication, assembly, and test yields. Due to the complexity of our products, we periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields as even minor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss or even cause halts in production. Our customers may also test our components once they have been assembled into their products. The number of usable products that result from our production process can fluctuate as a result of many factors, including the following:  design errors;  defects in photomasks, which are used to print circuits on wafers;  minute impurities in materials used;  contamination of the manufacturing environment;  equipment failure or variations in the manufacturing processes;  losses from broken wafers or other human error;  defects in packaging; and  issues and errors in testing. Typically, for a given level of sales, when our yields improve, our gross margin improves. When our yields decrease, our unit costs are typically higher, our gross margin is lower and our profitability is adversely affected, any or all of which can harm our results of operations and lower our stock price. We depend on third-party sales representatives and distributors for a material portion of our revenues. We sell many of our products to customers through independent sales representatives and distributors, as well as through our direct sales force. We are unable to predict the extent to which our independent sales representatives and distributors will be successful in marketing and selling our products. Moreover, many of our independent sales representatives and distributors also market and sell competing products. Our relationships with our representatives and distributors typically may be terminated by either party at any time, and do not require them to buy any of our products. Sales to distributors accounted for 22.5% of our revenue in fiscal year 2014, and sales to our largest distributor, Richardson, represented 15.0% of our revenue in the same period. If our distributors cease doing business with us or fail to successfully market and sell our products, our ability to sustain and grow our revenue could be materially adversely affected. Our internal and external manufacturing, assembly and test model subjects us to various manufacturing and supply risks. We operate a semiconductor wafer processing and manufacturing facility at our headquarters in Lowell, Massachusetts. This facility is also our primary internal design and assembly and test facility. We maintain other internal assembly and test operation facilities as well, including leased sites in Long Beach, California and Hsinchu, Taiwan. We also use multiple external foundries for outsourced semiconductor wafer supply, as well as multiple domestic and Asian assembly and test suppliers to assemble and test our products. A number of factors will affect the future success of these internal manufacturing facilities and outsourced supply and service arrangements, including the following:  the level of demand for our products;  our ability to expand and contract our facilities and purchase commitments in a timely and cost-effective manner in response to changes in demand for our products;  our ability to generate revenue in amounts that cover the significant fixed costs of operating our facilities; 25 Table of Contents  our ability to qualify our facilities for new products in a timely manner;  the availability of raw materials, including GaAs, SiGe and InP substrates and high purity source materials such as gallium, aluminum, arsenic, carbon, nitrite, indium and silicon;  our manufacturing cycle times and yields;  the political and economic risks associated with our reliance on outsourced Asian assembly and test suppliers;  the location of our facilities and those of our outsourced suppliers;  natural disasters impacting our facilities and those of our outsourced suppliers;  our ability to hire, train, manage and retain qualified production personnel;  our compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations; and  our ability to avoid prolonged periods of downtime or high levels of scrap in our and our suppliers facilities for any reason. We may experience difficulties in managing any future growth. To successfully conduct business in a rapidly evolving market, we must effectively plan and manage any current and future growth. Our ability to do so will be dependent on a number of factors, including:  maintaining access to sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demands;  arranging for sufficient supply of key raw materials and services to avoid shortages or supply bottlenecks;  building out our administrative infrastructure at the proper pace to support any current and future sales growth while maintaining operating efficiencies;  adhering to our high quality and process execution standards, particularly as we hire and train new employees and during periods of high volume;  managing the various components of our working capital effectively;  upgrading our operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, including improvement of our accounting and internal management systems; and  maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction. If we do not effectively manage any future growth, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive market opportunities, our operations may be impacted, and we may experience delays in delivering products to our customers or damaged customer relationships, and achieve lower than anticipated revenue and decreased profitability. We may not realize the expected benefits of our recent restructuring activities and other initiatives designed to reduce costs and increase revenue across our operations. We have pursued a number of restructuring initiatives designed to reduce costs and increase revenue across our operations. These initiatives included reductions in our number of manufacturing facilities and significant workforce reductions in certain areas as we realigned our business. Additional initiatives included establishing certain operations closer in location to our global customers and evaluating functions that may be more efficiently performed through outsourcing arrangements. These initiatives have been substantial in scope and disruptive to some of our historical operations. We may not realize the expected benefits of these new initiatives. 26 Table of Contents As a result of these initiatives, we have incurred restructuring or other charges and we may in the future experience disruptions in our operations, loss of personnel and difficulties in delivering products in a timely fashion. In fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred restructuring charges of $14.8 million, $1.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, consisting primarily of employee severance and related costs resulting from reductions in our workforce. Our business could be harmed if systems manufacturers choose not to use components made of compound semiconductor materials we utilize. Silicon semiconductor technologies are the dominant process technologies for the manufacture of ICs in high-volume, commercial markets, and the performance of silicon ICs continues to improve. While we use silicon for some applications, we also often use compound semiconductor technologies such as GaAs, InP, SiGe, or GaN to deliver reliable operation at higher power, higher frequency, or smaller form factor than a silicon solution has historically allowed. While these compound semiconductor materials offer high-performance features, it is generally more difficult to design and manufacture products with reliability and in volume using them. GaN and InP, in particular, are newer process technologies that do not have as extensive a track record of reliable performance in the field as many of the competing process technologies. Compound semiconductor technology tends to be more expensive than silicon technology due to its above-described challenges, and the generally lower volumes at which parts in those processes tend to be manufactured relative to silicon parts for high-volume consumer applications. System designers in some markets may be reluctant to adopt our non-silicon products or may be likely to adopt silicon products in lieu of our products if silicon products meeting their demanding performance requirements are available, because of:  their unfamiliarity with designing systems using our products;  their concerns related to manufacturing costs and yields;  their unfamiliarity with our design and manufacturing processes; or  the uncertainties about the relative cost effectiveness of our products compared to high-performance silicon components. We cannot be certain that additional systems manufacturers will design our compound semiconductor products into their systems or that the companies that have utilized our products will continue to do so in the future. Improvements in the performance of available silicon process technologies and solutions could result in a loss of market share on our part. If our products fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance for any of the above reasons, our results of operations will suffer. We may incur material costs and our business may be interrupted in connection with consolidation and outsourcing initiatives. We have a number of ongoing strategic initiatives aimed at reducing our long-term operating cost model, including the outsourcing of various manufacturing functions to third party suppliers and consolidation of our operations within existing facilities. While the goal of these actions is to reduce recurring fixed cost, there are associated restructuring charges and execution risks associated with these initiatives. Exiting a leased site may involve contractual or negotiated exit payments with the landlord, temporary holding over at an increased lease rate, costs to perform restoration work required by the lease, or associated environmental liability, any of which may be material in amount. Consolidation of operations and outsourcing may involve substantial capital expenses and the transfer of manufacturing processes and personnel from one site to another, with resultant startup issues at the receiving site and need for re-qualification of the transitioned operations with major customers and for ISO or other certifications. We may experience shortages of affected products, delays and higher than expected expenses. Affected employees may be distracted by the transition or may seek other employment, which could cause our overall operational efficiency to suffer. 27 Table of Contents We are subject to risks from our international sales and operations. We have operations in Europe, Asia and Australia, and customers around the world. As a result, we are subject to regulatory, geopolitical and other risks associated with doing business outside the U.S. Global operations involve inherent risks, including currency controls, currency exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, required import and export licenses, associated delays and other related international trade restrictions and regulations. The legal system in many of the regions where we conduct business can lack transparency in certain respects relative to that of the U.S. and can accord local government authorities a higher degree of control and discretion over business than is customary in the U.S. This makes the process of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and maintaining compliance inherently more difficult and unpredictable. In addition, the protection accorded to proprietary technology and know-how under these legal systems may not be as strong as in the U.S., and, as a result, we may lose valuable trade secrets and competitive advantages. The cost of doing business in European jurisdictions can also be higher than in the U.S. due to exchange rates, local collective bargaining regimes, and local legal requirements and norms regarding employee benefits and employer-employee relations, in particular. We are also subject to U.S. legal requirements related to our foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Sales to customers located outside the U.S. accounted for 49.1%, 41.3% and 47.1% of our revenue for the fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We expect that revenue from international sales will continue to be a significant part of our total revenue. Because the majority of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, our products become less price-competitive in countries with currencies that are low or are declining in value against the U.S. dollar. Also, we cannot be sure that our international customers will continue to accept orders denominated in U.S. dollars. If they do not, our reported revenue and earnings will become more directly subject to foreign exchange fluctuations. Some of our customer purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws, which may differ significantly from U.S. laws. We may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under such agreements and to collect amounts owed to us. The majority of our assembly, packaging, and test vendors are located in Asia. We generally do business with our foreign assemblers in U.S. dollars. Our manufacturing costs could increase in countries with currencies that are increasing in value against the U.S. dollar. Also, our international manufacturing suppliers may not continue to accept orders denominated in U.S. dollars. If they do not, our costs will become more directly subject to foreign exchange fluctuations. From time to time we may attempt to hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk by buying currency contracts or otherwise, and any such efforts involve expense and associated risk that the currencies involved may not behave as we expect, and we may lose money on such hedging strategies or not properly hedge our risk. In addition, if terrorist activity, armed conflict, civil, economic or military unrest or political instability occurs in the U.S. or other locations, such events may disrupt our manufacturing, assembly, logistics, security and communications, and could also result in reduced demand for our products. We have in the past and, may again in the future, experience difficulties relating to employees traveling in and out of countries facing civil unrest or political instability, and with obtaining travel visas for our employees. Major health pandemics could also adversely affect our business and our customer order patterns. We could also be affected if labor issues disrupt our transportation arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers. There can be no assurance that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our business could be adversely affected if we experience product returns, product liability and defects claims. Our products are complex and frequently operate in high-performance, challenging environments. We may not be able to anticipate all of the possible performance or reliability problems that could arise with our products after they are released to the market. If such problems occur or become significant, we may experience reduced 28 Table of Contents revenue and increased costs related to product recalls, inventory write-offs, warranty or damage claims, delays in, cancellations of, or returns of product orders and other expenses. The many materials and vendors used in the manufacture of our products increase the risk that some defects may escape detection in our manufacturing process and subsequently affect our customers, even in the case of long-standing product designs. Our use of newly-developed or less mature semiconductor process technologies, such as GaN and InP, which have a less extensive track record of reliability in the field than other more mature process technologies, also increases the risk of performance and reliability problems. These matters have arisen in our operations from time to time in the past, have resulted in significant expense to us per occurrence, and will likely occur again in the future. The occurrence of defects could result in product returns and liability claims, reduced product shipments, the loss of customers, the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, harm to our reputation, diversion of managements time and resources, lower revenue, higher expenses and reduced profitability. Any warranty or other rights we may have against our suppliers for quality issues caused by them may be more limited than those our customers have against us, based on our relative size, bargaining power, or otherwise. In addition, even if we ultimately prevail, such claims could result in costly litigation, divert managements time and resources and damage our customer relationships. We also face exposure to potential liability resulting from the fact that some of our customers integrate our products into consumer products such as automobiles or mobile communication devices, which are then sold to consumers in the marketplace. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused a loss. Product liability claims could result in significant expenses in connection with the defense of such claims and possible damages. In addition, we may be required to participate in a recall if our products prove to be defective. Any product recall or product liability claim brought against us, particularly in high-volume consumer markets, could have a material negative impact on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. The outcome of litigation in which we are involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could subject us to damage awards and lower the market price of our stock. From time to time we are a party to litigation matters such as those described in Part II. Item 1, Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report. These and any other future disputes, litigations, investigations, administrative proceedings or enforcement actions we may be involved in may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations, result in negative publicity and harm our customer or supplier relationships. Although we intend to contest such matters vigorously, we cannot assure you that their outcome will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any such matter in the future, including the results of any amicable settlement, could subject us to material damage awards or settlement payments or otherwise materially harm our business. Our financial results may be adversely affected by increased tax rates and exposure to additional tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of our worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region, each of which can change from period to period. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate as well as the actual tax ultimately payable could be adversely affected by changes in the amount of our earnings attributable to countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or tax rates (particularly in the U.S. or Ireland), increases in non-deductible expenses, the availability of tax credits, material audit assessments, or repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, each of which could materially affect our profitability. Any significant increase in our effective tax rates could materially reduce our net income in future periods and decrease the value of your investment in our common stock. Changes in tax laws are introduced from time to time to reform U.S. taxation of international business activities. Depending on the final form of legislation enacted, if any, these consequences may be significant for 29 Table of Contents us due to the large scale of our international business activities. If any of these proposals are enacted into legislation, they could have material adverse consequences on the amount of tax we pay and, thereby, on our financial position and results of operations. Our limited ability to protect our proprietary information and technology may adversely affect our ability to compete. Our future success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our protection of our proprietary information and technology through patent filings and otherwise. We cannot be certain that any patents we apply for will be issued or that any claims allowed from pending applications will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage. Our competitors may also be able to design around our patents. The laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured, or sold, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws, increasing the possibility of piracy of our technology and products. Although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or may need to expend significant financial and other resources in defending our rights. In addition, we rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities. We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. We cannot be sure that these agreements will be adequate and will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets and proprietary know-how will not otherwise become known or independently discovered by others. Additionally, our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy, or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology. Patent litigation is expensive, and our ability to enforce our patents and other intellectual property, is limited by our financial resources and is subject to general litigation risks. If we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that the intellectual property rights are invalid, are otherwise not enforceable, or are licensed to the party against whom we assert a claim. In addition, our assertion of intellectual property rights could result in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us, which is a frequent occurrence in such litigations. If we fail to comply with export control regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or other sanctions, including loss of export privileges. Certain of our products are subject to the Export Administration Regulations, administered by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry Security, which require that we obtain an export license before we can export products or technology to specified countries. Other products are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which restrict the export of information and material that may be used for military or intelligence applications by a foreign person. U.S. regulators have announced export control reform that is expected to change many of the rules applicable to us in this area in the future in ways we do not yet fully understand, and we could experience challenges in complying with the new rules as they become effective, or face difficulties or an inability to ship products to certain countries and customers. We are also subject to U.S. import regulations and the import and export regimes of other countries in which we operate. Failure to comply with these laws could result in sanctions by the government, including substantial monetary penalties, denial of export privileges and debarment from government contracts. Export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, or prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries or customers altogether. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach by regulators to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, changes in the interpretation of existing regulations by regulators or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could harm our business by resulting in decreased use of our products by, or our 30 Table of Contents decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. In addition, our sale of our products to or through third-party distributors, resellers and sales representatives creates the risk that any violation of these laws they may engage in may cause disruption in our markets or otherwise bring liability on us. We face risks associated with government contracting. Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. government or subcontracts with its prime contractors. Under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. If we were unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were to lose their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue. We may need to modify our activities or incur substantial costs to comply with environmental laws, and if we fail to comply with environmental laws, we could be subject to substantial fines or be required to change our operations. We are subject to a variety of international, federal, state and local governmental regulations directed at preventing or mitigating climate change and other environmental harms, as well as to the storage, discharge, handling, generation, disposal and labeling of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. If we fail to comply with these regulations, substantial fines could be imposed on us, and we could be required to suspend production, alter manufacturing processes, cease operations or remediate polluted land, air or groundwater, any of which could have a negative effect on our revenue, results of operations and business. Failure to comply with environmental regulations could subject us to civil or criminal sanctions and property damage or personal injury claims. Compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or build new facilities, or require us to acquire additional expensive equipment, modify our manufacturing processes, or incur other substantial expenses which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, under some of these laws and regulations, we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our properties or, those nearby are contaminated, even if we did not cause the contamination. We have incurred in the past and may in the future incur environmental liability based on the actions of prior owners, lessees or neighbors of sites we have leased or may lease in the future, or sites we become associated with due to acquisitions. We cannot predict:  changes in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations;  the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted;  our ability to enforce and collect under any indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities; or  the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims, including the cost of clean-up of currently unknown environmental conditions. In addition to the costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements, we may in the future incur costs defending against environmental litigation brought by government agencies, lessors at sites we currently lease or have been associated with in the past and other private parties. We may be defendants in lawsuits brought by parties in the future alleging environmental damage, personal injury or property damage. A significant judgment or fine levied against us, or agreed settlement payment, could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 31 Table of Contents Environmental regulations such as the WEEE and RoHS directives limit our flexibility and may require us to incur material expense. Various countries require companies selling a broad range of electrical equipment to conform to regulations such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and the European Directive 2002/95/Ec on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS). New environmental standards such as these could require us to redesign our products in order to comply with the standards, require the development of compliance administration systems or otherwise limit our flexibility in running our business or require us to incur substantial compliance costs. For example, RoHS requires that certain substances be removed from most electronic components. The WEEE directive makes producers of electrical and electronic equipment financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. We have already invested significant resources into complying with these regimes, and further investments may be required. Alternative designs implemented in response to regulation may be more costly to produce, resulting in an adverse effect on our gross profit margin. If we cannot develop compliant products in a timely fashion or properly administer our compliance programs, our revenue may also decline due to lower sales, which would adversely affect our operating results. Further, if we were found to be non-compliant with any rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results. Customer demands and new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and liabilities. In August 2012, the SEC adopted its final rule to implement Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding disclosure and reporting requirements for companies who use conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products. In the semiconductor industry, these minerals are most commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices and related assemblies. These new requirements could adversely affect our ability to source related minerals and metals and increase our related cost. We will face difficulties and increased expense associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Continued timely reporting is dependent upon the improvement and implementation of new systems and processes and information supplied by our suppliers of products that contain, or potentially contain, conflict minerals. Also, our supply chain is complex, and some suppliers may be unwilling to share related confidential information regarding the source of their products, or may provide us information that is inaccurate or inadequate. If those risks arise, or if our processes in obtaining that information do not fulfill the SECs requirements, we may face both reputational challenges and SEC enforcement risks based on our inability to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals and metals or otherwise. More recently, Executive Orders issued by the President of the U.S. have increased sanctions in this area as well, which may impact us in the scenarios described above. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy any related requirements of our customers, which may be different from or more onerous than the requirements of the related SEC rules and Executive Orders. If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitors products or may choose to disqualify us as a supplier, and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it becomes unsalable as a result of these regulations. 32 Table of Contents Our term loan and revolving credit facility could result in outstanding debt with a claim to our assets that is senior to that of our stockholders, and may have other adverse effects on our results of operations. As of October 3, 2014, we have a term loan outstanding of $349.1 million and revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders with a potential future borrowing availability of up to $100.0 million, subject to compliance with financial and other covenants. As of October 3, 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. However, we currently intend to draw approximately $100 million on the revolving credit facility to partially fund the BinOptics Acquisition. The facility is secured by a first priority lien on all domestic subsidiaries. The amount of our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may be limited;  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in a sale or liquidation until any balance on the line is repaid in full;  we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions;  our cash flow from operations will be allocated to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, any outstanding indebtedness; and  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or other sources to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the facility and to fund other liquidity needs. Our credit facility also contains certain restrictive covenants that may limit or eliminate our ability to incur additional debt, sell, lease or transfer our assets, pay dividends, make capital expenditures, investments and loans, make acquisitions, guarantee debt or obligations, create liens, enter into transactions with our affiliates, enter into new lines of business and enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganizations transactions. These restrictions could limit our ability to withstand downturns in our business or the economy in general or to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, any of which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that are not subject to such restrictions. If we breach a loan covenant, the lenders could either refuse to lend funds to us or accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. We might not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness upon a default. If we are unable to repay the indebtedness, the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding against us or collection proceedings with respect to our subsidiaries securing the facility, which could materially decrease the value of our common stock. We are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. As a holding company, we derive substantially all of our cash flow from our subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments or distributions to meet our operating needs. Legal and contractual restrictions in any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. The deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. Variability in self-insurance liability estimates could adversely impact our results of operations. We self-insure for employee health insurance and workers compensation insurance coverage up to a predetermined level, beyond which we maintain stop-loss insurance from a third-party insurer. Our aggregate exposure varies from year to year based upon the number of participants in our insurance plans. We estimate our 33 Table of Contents self-insurance liabilities using an analysis provided by our claims administrator and our historical claims experience. Our accruals for insurance reserves reflect these estimates and other management judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability. If the number or severity of claims for which we self-insure increases, it could cause a material and adverse change to our reserves for self-insurance liabilities, as well as to our earnings. We may be subject to liabilities based on alleged links between the semiconductor manufacturing process and certain illnesses and birth defects. In recent years, there has been increased media scrutiny and associated reports regarding a potential link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments and birth defects and certain illnesses, primarily cancer. Regulatory agencies and industry associations have begun to study the issue to determine if any actual correlation exists. Because we utilize clean rooms, we may become subject to liability claims alleging personal injury. In addition, these reports may also affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. A significant judgment against us or material defense costs could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third parties to provide corporate infrastructure services necessary for the operation of our business. Any failure of one or more of our vendors to provide these services could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on third-party vendors to provide critical corporate infrastructure services, including, among other things, certain services related to information technology and network development and monitoring. We depend on these vendors to ensure that our corporate infrastructure will consistently meet our business requirements. The ability of these third-party vendors to successfully provide reliable, high quality services is subject to technical and operational uncertainties that are beyond our control. While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, our agreements with these vendors limit the amount of damages we may receive. In addition, we do not know whether we will be able to collect on any award of damages or that any such damages would be sufficient to cover the actual costs we would incur as a result of any vendors failure to perform under its agreement with us. Any failure of our corporate infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete. Risks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock The market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors. You should consider an investment in our common stock risky and invest only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the market value of your investment. In addition to the risks described in this report, other factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:  changes in general economic, industry and market conditions;  domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;  changes in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance, as was the case in August 2012 when the trading price of our common stock declined approximately 21% on the day following our public announcement of lower than expected revenue, gross margin and business outlook figures; 34 Table of Contents  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;  changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;  addition or loss of significant customers;  announcements by us or our competitors, customers or suppliers of significant products, contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or other events;  developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including any injunction issued or material sums paid for damage awards, settlement payments, license fees, attorneys fees or other litigation expenses associated with intellectual property lawsuits we may initiate, or in which we may be named as defendants;  failure to complete significant sales;  developments concerning current or future strategic alliances or acquisitions;  any future sales of our common stock or other securities; and  additions or departures of directors, executives or key personnel. Furthermore, the stock markets recently have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or change their opinion of our common stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease their coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Our common stock price may decline if a substantial number of shares are sold in the market by our stockholders. Future sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Increased sales of our common stock in the market for any reason could exert significant downward pressure on our stock price. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price we deem appropriate. Some of our stockholders can exert control over us, and they may not make decisions that reflect our interests or those of other stockholders. Our largest stockholders control a significant amount of our outstanding common stock. As of October 3, 2014, John and Susan Ocampo beneficially owned 52.6% of our common stock and certain investment funds affiliated with Summit Partners, L.P. owned 19.9% of our common stock on an as-converted basis. As a result, 35 Table of Contents these stockholders will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and control over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of us and might affect the market price of our securities. In addition, the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders. We may engage in future capital-raising transactions that dilute our stockholders or cause us to incur debt. We may issue additional equity, debt or convertible securities to raise capital in the future. If we do, existing stockholders may experience significant further dilution. In addition, new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges that differ from, or are senior to, those of our existing stockholders. Our incurrence of indebtedness could limit our operating flexibility and be detrimental to our results of operations. We are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. Such a report will contain, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. If our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during this process, we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. We cannot assure you that we will not have deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. We may also rely on external consultants to supplement our internal controls. For example, we may rely on external consultants to supplement our financial reporting in connection with our accounting for income taxes and other complex accounting and financial matters, some of which require significant technical accounting expertise or require significant judgment. Use of external consultants involves additional risk that our external consultants may not perform as expected, or that coordination between our internal and external resources may not be adequate, resulting in one or more procedures not being performed or reviewed as planned, or one or more errors not being identified and corrected. If we do not effectively manage our external consultants or if they fail to perform as expected or fail to provide an adequate level of expertise in certain areas, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired and the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports could be compromised, which could adversely affect our stock price. As an emerging growth company, we have elected to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and thus our financial statements may not be comparable to those of most other companies. In addition, we are entitled to utilize other reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies. Pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), as an emerging growth company, we have elected to take advantage of an extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or the SEC, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can delay adoption of the standard until it applies to private companies. This may make a 36 Table of Contents comparison of our financial statements with any other public company that is not an emerging growth company difficult, as they may be applying different standards. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and could decline. As an emerging growth company, we also intend to utilize certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to provide the auditor attestation report otherwise required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We may utilize these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, subject to certain conditions. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company that stockholders may consider beneficial and may adversely affect the price of our stock. Provisions of our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or change of control that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock, staggered elections of directors, and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters to be submitted to a stockholder vote. Provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with our company or obtaining control of our company. Specifically, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law may prohibit business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and could reduce our value. We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of cash dividends is restricted under the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness. In addition, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends may be limited by restrictions on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries, including restrictions under the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. We are a controlled company within the meaning of the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, and, as a result, will qualify for, and will rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements. John and Susan Ocampo control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. We are a controlled company within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Under these rules, a listed company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:  the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;  the requirement that the listed company have a nominating and governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities; 37 Table of Contents  the requirement that the listed company have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities; and,  the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance and compensation committees. We currently are a controlled company, currently plan to rely on the exemption regarding the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors in the future, and may utilize any or all of these exemptions from time to time in the future. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market. ITEM 1B.
