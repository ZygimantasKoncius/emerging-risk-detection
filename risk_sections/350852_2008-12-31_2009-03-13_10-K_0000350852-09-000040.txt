Item 1A. Risk Factors Enterprise Risk Management Risk is an inherent component of CTBI’s business activities. The ability to effectively identify, assess, measure, respond, monitor, and report on risk in our business activities is critical to the achievement of CTBI’s mission and strategic objectives. CTBI utilizes an enterprise wide risk management (EWRM) process designed to provide the Board and management with the capabilities needed to identify, assess, and manage the full spectrum of risks inherent to our industry. While business unit managers are primarily responsible for managing risk inherent in their areas of responsibility, CTBI has established a risk management governance structure to establish policies, monitor adherence to the policies, and manage the overall risk profile of the company. CTBI’s EWRM program is not intended to replace normal risk management activities conducted by the business unit managers. The EWRM program is designed to provide a portfolio view of risks across the entire enterprise. As an integral part of the risk management process, management has established various committees consisting of senior executives and others within CTBI. The purpose of these committees is to closely monitor risks and ensure that adequate risk management practices exist within their respective areas of authority. Some of the principal committees include the Asset/Liability Management (ALCO) Committee, the Loan Portfolio Risk Management Committee, the Senior Credit Committee, the Information Technology Steering Committee, and various compliance-related committees. Overlapping membership of these committees by senior executives and others helps provide a unified view of risk on an enterprise-wide basis. To facilitate an enterprise-wide view of CTBI’s risk profile and coordinate the enterprise risk management governance process, a Chief Risk Officer has been appointed, who oversees the process and reports on CTBI’s risk profile. Additionally, risk champions are assigned for various areas. The risk champions facilitate implementation of the enterprise risk management and governance process across the company. An Enterprise Risk Management Committee has been established consisting of senior executives and others within CTBI, which oversees and supports the EWRM process. The Board of Directors, through its Risk and Compliance Committee, has overall responsibility for oversight of CTBI’s enterprise risk management governance process. Economic Risk CTBI may continue to be adversely affected by current economic and market conditions. The national and global economic downturn has recently resulted in unprecedented levels of financial market volatility and has in general adversely impacted the market value of financial institutions, limited access to capital and had an adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of banking companies in general, including CTBI. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength. During this time, CTBI has experienced challenges, credit quality has deteriorated and net income and results of operations have been adversely impacted. Although CTBI operated at a profit last year, CTBI is a part of the financial system and a continuation of the systemic lack of available credit, lack of confidence in the financial sector, increased volatility in the financial markets, and reduced business activity could materially and adversely impact CTBI’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the possible duration and severity of the adverse economic cycle is unknown and may exacerbate financial service providers’, including CTBI’s, exposure to credit risk. Actions by Congress, Treasury, the FDIC and other governmental agencies and regulators have been initiated to address economic stabilization, yet the efficacy of these programs in stabilizing the economy and the banking system is uncertain. There can be no assurance that these actions will not have an adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of financial service providers including CTBI. Economy of Our Markets Our business may continue to be adversely affected by downturns in the local economies on which we depend. Our loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in eastern, northeastern, central, and south central Kentucky and southern West Virginia. Our profits depend on providing products and services to clients in these local regions. These regions have recently experienced an increase in unemployment and a decrease in real estate values. Further increases in unemployment, additional decreases in real estate values, or increases in interest rates could weaken the local economies in which we operate. Weakness in our market area could depress our earnings and consequently our financial condition because: · Clients may not want or need our products and services; · Borrowers may not be able to repay their loans; · The value of the collateral securing our loans to borrowers may decline; and · The quality of our loan portfolio may decline. Interest Rate Risk Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. Our earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest-rate spreads, meaning the difference between the interest rates earned on loans and investments and the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings, could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including: · The rate of inflation; · The rate of economic growth; · Employment levels; · Monetary policies; and · Instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Changes in market interest rates will also affect the level of voluntary prepayments on our loans and the receipt of payments on our mortgage-backed securities resulting in the receipt of proceeds that may be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage-backed security being prepaid. We originate residential loans for sale and for our portfolio. The origination of loans for sale is designed to meet client financing needs and earn fee income. The origination of loans for sale is highly dependent upon the local real estate market and the level and trend of interest rates. Increasing interest rates may reduce the origination of loans for sale and consequently the fee income we earn. While our commercial banking, construction, and income property business lines remain a significant portion of our activities, high interest rates may reduce our mortgage-banking activities and thereby our income. In contrast, decreasing interest rates have the effect of causing clients to refinance mortgage loans faster than anticipated. This causes the value of assets related to the servicing rights on loans sold to be lower than originally anticipated. If this happens, we may need to write down our servicing assets faster, which would accelerate our expense and lower our earnings. We consider interest rate risk one of our most significant market risks. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates. Consistency of our net interest revenue is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. We employ a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage our interest rate risk including the use of an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates. The model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off-balance sheet instruments and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities. Assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model. These assumptions are inherently uncertain, and as a result, the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies. Federal Deposit Insurance Increases Our results of operations may be adversely impacted by increased FDIC insurance assessments. As a result of the weakness of certain financial institutions, the FDIC has taken action that will result in increased FDIC insurance assessments for United States FDIC-insured financial institutions, including CTBI. Under the deposit insurance restoration plan approved by the FDIC in October 2008, the Board set a rate schedule to raise the insurance reserve ratio to 1.15 percent within five years. On February 27, 2009, the FDIC announced that the restoration plan horizon has been extended to seven years in light of the current significant strains on banks and the financial system and the likelihood of a severe recession. In addition, the FDIC announced a special assessment of up to 20 basis points to be collected on September 30, 2009. The FDIC may also impose an emergency special assessment after June 30, 2009 of up to 10 basis points if the FDIC deems that an additional special assessment is necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance. The special assessment of up to 20 basis points, the increase in regular quarterly assessments, and a possible 10 basis point emergency assessment will significantly increase insurance assessments for FDIC-insured institutions in general, including CTBI. Government Policies Our business may be adversely affected by changes in government policies. The earnings of banks and bank holding companies such as ours are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the money supply. Among the methods employed by the Federal Reserve Board are open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial and savings banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The banking industry is highly regulated and changes in federal and state banking regulations as well as policies and administration guidelines may affect our practices, growth prospects, and earnings. In particular, there is no assurance that recent governmental actions designed to stabilize the economy and banking system will not adversely affect the financial position or results of operations of CTBI. Proposed legislation may create an environment that will unreasonably delay the collection of past due amounts, result in restructurings and collection of less than the full amount due to CTBI and impede our ability to make new residential loans. In addition, the recently announced special FDIC deposit insurance assessment of up to 20 basis points, the increase in regular quarterly deposit insurance assessments, the possible 10 basis point emergency assessment, and possible future increases in regular quarterly deposit insurance assessments will significantly increase insurance assessments for FDIC-insured institutions in general, including CTBI. Credit Risk Our earnings and reputation may be adversely affected if we fail to effectively manage our credit risk. Originating and underwriting loans are integral to the success of our business. This business requires us to take “credit risk,” which is the risk of losing principal and interest income because borrowers fail to repay loans. Collateral values and the ability of borrowers to repay their loans may be affected at any time by factors such as: · The length and severity of downturns in the local economies in which we operate or the national economy; · The length and severity of downturns in one or more of the business sectors in which our customers operate, particularly the automobile, hotel/motel, coal, and residential development industries; or · A rapid increase in interest rates. Although we do not have a subprime lending program, the current subprime lending crisis may have an adverse effect on our residential loan portfolio as proposed legislation may create an environment that will unreasonably delay the collection of past due amounts, result in restructurings and collection of less than the full amounts due to CTBI, and impede our ability to make new residential loans. Competition Strong competition within our market area may reduce our ability to attract and retain deposits and originate loans. We face competition both in originating loans and in attracting deposits. Competition in the financial services industry is intense. We compete for clients by offering excellent service and competitive rates on our loans and deposit products. The type of institutions we compete with include commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms. Competition arises from institutions located within and outside our market areas. As a result of their size and ability to achieve economies of scale, certain of our competitors offer a broader range of products and services than we offer. The recent economic crisis is likely to result in increased consolidation in the financial industry and larger financial institutions, some of whom may benefit from partial nationalization, may strengthen their competitive positions. In addition, to stay competitive in our markets we may need to adjust the interest rates on our products to match the rates offered by our competitors, which could adversely affect our net interest margin. As a result, our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas while achieving our investment objectives. Acquisition Risk We may have difficulty in the future continuing to grow through acquisitions. Due to consolidation within the banking industry, the number of suitable acquisition targets has decreased and there is intense competition for attractive acquisitions. As a result, we may experience difficulty in making acquisitions on acceptable terms. Any future acquisitions or mergers by CTBI or its banking subsidiary are subject to approval by the appropriate federal and state banking regulators. The banking regulators evaluate a number of criteria in making their approval decisions, such as: · Safety and soundness guidelines; · Compliance with all laws including the USA Patriot Act, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations promulgated under such Act or the Exchange Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and all other applicable fair lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory business practices; and · Anti-competitive concerns with the proposed transaction. If the banking regulators or a commenter on our regulatory application raise concerns about any of these criteria at the time a regulatory application is filed, the banking regulators may deny, delay, or condition their approval of a proposed transaction. We have grown, and intend to continue to grow, through acquisitions of banks and other financial institutions. After these acquisitions, we may experience adverse changes in results of operations of acquired entities, unforeseen liabilities, asset quality problems of acquired entities, loss of key personnel, loss of clients because of change of identity, difficulties in integrating data processing and operational procedures, and deterioration in local economic conditions. These various acquisition risks can be heightened in larger transactions. Integration Risk We may not be able to achieve the expected integration and cost savings from our ongoing bank acquisition activities. We have a long history of acquiring financial institutions and we expect this acquisition activity to continue in the future. Difficulties may arise in the integration of the business and operations of the financial institutions that agree to merge with and into CTBI and, as a result, we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and synergies that we expect will result from the merger activities. Achieving cost savings is dependent on consolidating certain operational and functional areas, eliminating duplicative positions and terminating certain agreements for outside services. Additional operational savings are dependent upon the integration of the banking businesses of the acquired financial institution with that of CTBI, including the conversion of the acquired entity’s core operating systems, data systems and products to those of CTBI and the standardization of business practices. Complications or difficulties in the conversion of the core operating systems, data systems, and products of these other banks to those of CTBI may result in the loss of clients, damage to our reputation within the financial services industry, operational problems, one-time costs currently not anticipated by us, and/or reduced cost savings resulting from the merger activities. Operational Risk An extended disruption of vital infrastructure or a security breach could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our operations depend upon, among other things, our infrastructure, including equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, computer hacking or viruses, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such activity, or other events outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition in particular. Our business recovery plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruption of our operations. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. Market Risk Community Trust Bancorp, Inc.'s stock price is volatile. Our stock price has been volatile in the past, and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include: · Actual or anticipated variations in earnings; · Changes in analysts' recommendations or projections; · CTBI's announcements of developments related to our businesses; · Operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers; · New technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors; and · News reports of trends, concerns, and other issues related to the financial services industry. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to CTBI's performance. The recent financial crisis has resulted in a lack of investor confidence in the financial institutions sector. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. Technology Risk CTBI continually encounters technological change. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. Counterparty Risk The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect CTBI. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional counterparties. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, or results of operations. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.

Interest income actually received and included in net income for the period was $0.7 million, leaving $2.8 million of interest income not recognized during the period. Discussion of the Nonaccrual Policy The accrual of interest income on loans is discontinued when the collection of interest and principal in full is not expected. When interest accruals are discontinued, interest income accrued in the current period is reversed and interest income accrued in prior periods is charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Any loans past due 90 days or more must be well secured and in the process of collection to continue accruing interest. Potential Problem Loans Interest accrual is discontinued when we believe, after considering economic and business conditions, collateral value, and collection efforts, that the borrower’s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful. Foreign Outstandings None Loan Concentrations We had no concentration of loans exceeding 10% of total loans at December 31, 2008.
