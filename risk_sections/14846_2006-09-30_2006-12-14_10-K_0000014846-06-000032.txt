Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, readers should carefully consider the following risk factors: Risks Related to Our Business If borrowers default on loans, we will experience a decrease in income and any recovery may be limited by the value of the underlying property Loan defaults will result in a decrease in interest income and may require an increase in loan loss reserves. The decrease in interest income resulting from loan defaults may be for a prolonged period of time as we seek to recover primarily through legal proceedings, the outstanding principal balance, accrued interest, default interest and our legal costs. These legal proceedings, which may include foreclosure actions and bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings, are expensive and time consuming. The decrease in interest income and the costs involved in seeking to recover the outstanding amounts will reduce the amount of cash available to meet our expenses. In addition, the decrease in interest income and increases in loan loss reserves will have an adverse impact on our net income, taxable income and shareholders' equity. The decrease in interest income and the costs involved in seeking to recover the outstanding amounts could have an adverse impact on the cash distributions paid by us to our shareholders and our ability to continue to pay cash distributions in the future. Our primary source of recovery in the event of a loan default is the real property underlying a defaulted loan and, therefore, the value of our loan depends upon the value of the underlying real property. The value of the underlying property is dependent on numerous factors outside of our control, including national, regional and local business and economic conditions, government economic policies, the level of interest rates and non-performance of lease obligations by tenants occupying space at the underlying real property. The loan to value ratio is the ratio of the amount of the loan, plus any senior indebtedness, to the value of the real property underlying the loan as determined by our own in-house procedures. The higher the loan to value ratio, the greater the risk that the amount obtainable from a foreclosure or bankruptcy sale may be insufficient to repay the loan in full upon default. The loan to value ratio of certain of our loans exceeds 80%. In addition, we may find it necessary to acquire the property at a foreclosure sale or bankruptcy auction, in which event we assume the risks that may result from ownership of the property. If a significant number of our mortgage loans are in default or we otherwise must write down our loans, a breach of our revolving credit facility could occur Our revolving credit facility with North Fork Bank, VNB New York Corp., Signature Bank and Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company includes financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including a debt service ratio and an equity to indebtedness ratio. If a significant number of our mortgage loans are in default or if a recessionary environment exists under which generally accepted accounting principles require us to take provisions against our loans or against our real estate assets, our financial position could be materially adversely affected causing us to be in breach of the financial covenants. A breach by us of the covenants to maintain the financial ratios would place us in default under our revolving credit facility, and, if the banks called a default and required us to repay the full amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility, we might be required to dispose of assets in a rapid fashion, which could have an adverse impact on the amounts we would receive on such disposition. If we are unable to dispose of assets in a timely fashion to the satisfaction of the banks, the banks could foreclose on all, or any portion of, our loan portfolio pledged to the banks as collateral, which could result in the disposition of loans at below market values. The disposition of loans at below our carrying value would adversely affect our net income, reduce our net worth and adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our shareholders. The inability of our borrowers to refinance or sell underlying real property may lead to defaults on our loans A substantial majority of our mortgage portfolio is short term and due within five years. In addition, our borrowers are required to pay all or substantially all of the principal balance of our loans at maturity, in most cases with little or no amortization of principal over the term of the loan. Accordingly, in order to satisfy this obligation, at the maturity of a loan, a borrower will be required to refinance or sell the property or otherwise raise a substantial amount of cash. The ability to refinance or sell or otherwise raise a substantial amount of cash is dependent upon certain factors which neither we nor our borrowers control, such as national, local and regional business and economic conditions, government economic policies and the level of interest rates. If a borrower is unable to pay the balance due at maturity, and we are not willing to extend or restructure the loan, in most cases we will be required to foreclose on the property, which can be expensive and time consuming and could adversely affect our net income, shareholders' equity and cash distributions to shareholders. A portion of our loans are subordinate loans which carry a greater risk of loss than senior loans We also loan funds to our borrowers in the form of junior mortgage loans or junior participations in mortgage loans. Because of their subordinate position, junior liens carry a greater risk than senior liens, including a substantially greater risk of non-payment of interest or principal. A decline in real estate values in the region in which the underlying property is located could adversely affect the value of our collateral, so that the outstanding balance of senior liens may exceed the value of the underlying property. In the event of a default on a junior lien, if permitted, we may elect to make payments to the senior mortgage holder in order to prevent foreclosure of the senior lien holder. However, in certain situations, we may not have the right to make payments to the senior lien holder, or may choose not to make such payments despite having the right to do so. In such cases, the senior lien holder may foreclose and we will be entitled to share in the proceeds of the foreclosure sale only after amounts due to senior lien holders have been paid in full. This can result in the loss of all or part of our investment, adversely affecting our net income, shareholders' equity and cash distributions to our shareholders. We may suffer a loss if a borrower defaults on a loan that is secured by undeveloped land We provide loans that are secured by undeveloped land. These loans are subject to a higher risk of default because such properties generally are not income-producing properties. Following a borrower's default, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a lender and may incur costs in protecting our investment. In addition, the market value of such properties may be volatile. Consequently, in the event of a default and foreclosure, we may not be able to sell such a property for an amount equal to our investment or at all. As a result, we may lose all or part of our investment, adversely affecting our net income, shareholders' equity and cash distributions to our shareholders. We may suffer a loss if a borrower defaults on a loan that is not secured by underlying real estate We occasionally provide loans that are secured by equity interests in the borrowing entities. These loans are subject to the risk that other lenders may be directly secured by the real estate assets of the borrower. In the event of a default and foreclosure or bankruptcy sale, those secured lenders would have priority over us with respect to the proceeds of a sale of the underlying real estate. As a result, we may lose all or part of our investment, adversely affecting our net income, shareholders' equity and cash distributions to our shareholders. We are subject to the risks associated with loan participations, such as lack of full control rights Some of our investments are participating interests in loans in which we share the rights, obligations and benefits of the loan with other participating lenders. We may need the consent of these parties to exercise our rights under such loans, including rights with respect to amendment of loan documentation, enforcement proceeding and the institution of, and control over, foreclosure proceedings. In addition, to the extent our participation represents a minority interest, a majority of the participants may be able to take actions which are not consistent with our objectives. We may have less control of our investment when we invest in joint ventures We have made loans to, and acquired equity interests in, joint ventures that own income producing real property. Our co-venturers may have different interests or goals than we do or our co-venturers may not be able or willing to take an action that is desired by us. A disagreement with respect to the activities of the joint venture could result in a substantial diversion of time and effort by our management and could result in our exercise, or one of our co-venturers exercise, of the buy/sell provision typically contained in our joint venture organizational documents. In addition, there is no limitation under our charter documents as to the amount of funds that we may invest in joint ventures. Accordingly, we may invest a substantial amount of our funds in joint ventures which ultimately may not be profitable as a result of disagreements with and among our co-venturers. The accounting treatment of the assets held by our CIT joint venture could make it difficult to analyze our future financial statements and to compare them with our prior period financial statements We presently are a 25% joint venture partner with CIT Capital USA, Inc. in a joint venture that was established in November 2006 to originate bridge loans similar to those which we generally originate. Because our share of earnings from the joint venture will be shown on our financial statements under the equity method of accounting, it will be more difficult to analyze our earnings. In addition, it may be difficult to compare our investment in the joint venture, as reflected in our financial statements, with our financial statements from prior periods. Our inability to control our joint venture with CIT could result in diversion of time and effort by our management and the inability to achieve the goals of the joint venture Our investment in the joint venture with CIT Capital USA, Inc. may involve risks not otherwise present in investments made solely by us, including that our co-investor may have different interests or goals than we do, and that our co-investor may not be willing to take an action that is desired by us. Disagreements with our co-investor could result in the inability of the joint venture to successfully fund, finance or otherwise manage loans as intended by the joint venture agreement. In addition, under the joint venture agreement, we have agreed to present loan proposals received by us to the joint venture, for its consideration on a right of first refusal basis, until the joint venture originates loans with an aggregate principal amount of $100 million (or $150 million if the joint venture obtains a line of credit of $50 million). As a result, we will be required to share in the income of all loans we originate that the joint venture accepts, until the joint venture's portfolio reaches $100 million (or $150 million if the joint venture obtains a line of credit of $50 million). The BRT member of the joint venture has also agreed to reimburse the CIT member, on a limited basis, for certain losses, if any, incurred by the joint venture on foreclosed property. Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses A significant source of risk arises from the possibility that losses could be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. We maintain an allowance for loan losses to manage the risk associated with loan defaults and non-performance by assessing the likelihood of non-performance, tracking loan performance and diversifying our portfolio. However, unexpected losses may occur that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unexpected losses may arise from a wide variety of specific or systemic factors, many of which are beyond our ability to predict, influence or control. The allowance for loan losses reflects our estimate of the probable losses in our loan portfolio at the relevant balance sheet date. Our allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the known risks in the current portfolio and economic factors. The determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond our control and these losses may exceed current estimates. Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title In the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to governmental entities or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination associated with the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The geographic concentration of our portfolio may make our revenues and the value of our portfolio vulnerable to adverse changes in local economic conditions A substantial amount of our outstanding loans are secured by properties located in the New York metropolitan area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, and in Florida, although we originate and hold for investment loans secured by real property located anywhere in the United States and Puerto Rico. A lack of geographical diversification may make our mortgage portfolio more sensitive to local or regional economic conditions, which may result in higher default rates than might be incurred if our portfolio were more geographically diverse. We face intense competition in acquiring desirable mortgage investments We encounter significant competition from other mortgage REITs, commercial banks, savings and loan associations, specialty finance companies, conduits, pension funds, public and private lending companies and mortgage bankers. Many of our competitors are larger than us, may have greater access to capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us in providing certain services to borrowers. Competition may result in higher prices for mortgage assets, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over borrowing costs. In addition, an increase in funds available to lenders, or a decrease in borrowing activity, may increase competition for making loans and may result in loans available to us having a greater risk. Our revenues and the value of our portfolio are affected by a number of factors that affect investments in real estate generally We are subject to the general risks of the real estate market. These include adverse changes in general and local economic conditions, demographics, retailing trends and traffic patterns, competitive overbuilding, casualty losses and other factors beyond our control. The value of the collateral underlying our loans, as well as the real estate owned by us and by joint ventures in which we are an equity participant, also may be negatively affected by factors such as the cost of complying with environmental regulations and liability under applicable environmental laws, interest rate changes and the availability of financing. Income from a commercial or multifamily residential property will also be adversely affected if a significant number of tenants are unable to pay rent, if tenants terminate or cancel leases or if available space cannot be rented on favorable terms. Operating and other expenses of properties, particularly significant expenses such as real estate taxes, maintenance costs and casualty and liability insurance costs, generally do not decrease when income decreases and even if revenues increase, operating and other expenses may increase faster than revenues. Changes in interest rates may harm our results of operations Our results of operations are likely to be harmed during any period of unexpected or rapid changes in interest rates. A substantial or sustained increase in interest rates could harm our ability to originate mortgage loans or acquire participations in mortgage loans. Interest rate fluctuations may also harm our earnings by causing an increase in mortgage prepayments or by changing the spread between the interest rates on our borrowings and the interest rates on our mortgage assets. Our revenues and the value of our portfolio may be negatively affected by casualty events occurring on properties securing our loans We require our borrowers to obtain, for our benefit, comprehensive insurance covering the property and any improvements to the property collateralizing our loan in an amount intended to be sufficient to provide for the costs of replacement in the event of casualty. In addition, joint ventures in which we are an equity participant carry comprehensive insurance covering the property and any improvements to the property owned by the joint venture for the costs of replacement in the event of a casualty. Further, we carry insurance for such purpose on properties owned by us. However, the amount of insurance coverage maintained for any property may not be sufficient to pay the full replacement cost following a casualty event. In addition, the rent loss coverage under a policy may not extend for the full period of time that a tenant may be entitled to a rent abatement that is a result of, or that may be required to complete restoration following, a casualty event. In addition, there are certain types of losses, such as those arising from earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and terrorist attacks, that may be uninsurable or that may not be economically insurable. Changes in zoning, building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors may make it impossible for our borrower, a joint venture or us, as the case may be, to use insurance proceeds to replace damaged or destroyed improvements at a property. If any of these or similar events occur, the amount of coverage may not be sufficient to replace a damaged or destroyed property and/or to repay in full the amount due on all loans collateralized by such property. As a result, our returns and the value of our investment may be reduced. An SEC investigation involving our affiliate could adversely affect our stock price On June 21, 2006, One Liberty Properties, Inc., a company affiliated with us, announced that it received a formal order of investigation from the SEC. One Liberty has disclosed that the SEC has requested information regarding "related party" transactions between One Liberty and entities affiliated with it and with certain of One Liberty's officers and directors and compensation paid to certain of One Liberty's executive officers by those affiliates. In connection with such investigation, the SEC served a subpoena on us requesting that the we produce certain documents, relating to, among other things, related party transactions between us and certain affiliates of ours and our executive officers. One Liberty and BRT have several executive officers and directors in common. Moreover, we have engaged in the past in related party transactions with some of the same affiliated entities as One Liberty and others and continue to do so. We are complying with the SEC's subpoena. We are not aware of the scope of the SEC's investigation of One Liberty. We cannot predict what the outcome of the SEC's investigation or document request will be. Senior management and other key personnel are critical to our business and our future success may depend on our ability to retain them We depend on the services of Fredric H. Gould, chairman of our board of trustees, Jeffrey A. Gould, our president and chief executive officer, and other members of our senior management to carry out business and investment strategies. In addition to Jeffrey A. Gould, only three other executive officers, our vice presidents, David Heiden and Mitchell Gould, and our vice president and chief financial officer, George Zweier, devote substantially all of their business time to our company. The remainder of our executive management personnel share their services on a part-time basis with entities affiliated with us and located in the same executive offices. In addition, Jeffrey A. Gould devotes a limited amount of his business time to entities affiliated with us. As we grow our business, we will need to attract and retain qualified senior management and other key personnel, both on a full-time and part-time basis. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could impair our ability to carry out our business and our investment strategies. We do not carry key man life insurance on members of our senior management. Our transactions with affiliated entities involve conflicts of interest Entities affiliated with us and with certain of our officers provide services to us and on our behalf and we intend to continue the relationships with such entities in the future. Although our policy is to ensure that we receive terms in transactions with affiliates that are at least as favorable as those that we would receive if the transactions were entered into with unaffiliated entities, these transactions raise the potential that we may not receive terms as favorable as those that we would receive if the transactions were entered into with unaffiliated entities. We will be adversely affected by a decrease in the market value of, or cash distributions paid on, shares of Entertainment Properties Trust The closing market value of the shares of EPR owned by us at September 30, 2006 and November 30, 2006 were $49.8 million and $61.3 million, respectively, while our cost basis was $13.3 million. At September 30, 2006, our balance sheet reflects as an asset $53.3 million of available-for-sale securities, of which $49.8 million represents the market value of the shares of EPR owned by us on September 30, 2006 and $36.5 million, or 24% of our shareholders' equity, represents the difference between our cost basis for such shares and the market value for such shares. We have no business relationship, affiliation with or influence over the business or operations of EPR. Any substantial decrease in the market value of EPR shares, whether resulting from activities of EPR, its management, market forces or otherwise, could result in a material decrease in our total assets and our shareholders' equity. Our ownership of shares of EPR resulted in the receipt by us for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 of cash dividends of $2.7 million. If there is a decrease in the EPR dividend for any reason, it could reduce the amount of cash distributions available for our shareholders. In addition, if the stock price of EPR were to decline, our profit from the sale of these shares would decline or could be eliminated. We have established two margin lines of credit collateralized primarily by the EPR shares owned by us. At September 30, 2006, $26.5 million was available under these margin lines of credit, of which $19.5 million was outstanding, and at November 30, 2006, $31.5 million was available under these margin lines of credit, of which $19.0 million was outstanding. Our margin lines of credit were paid in full on December 11, 2006 from the proceeds we received from our underwritten public offering completed on December 11, 2006. When we have amounts outstanding under these margin lines of credit, a significant decrease in the value of the EPR shares could result in a margin call and, if cash is not available from other sources, a sale of EPR shares may be required at a time when we would prefer not to sell EPR shares, resulting in the possibility that such shares could be sold at a loss. Risks Related to the REIT Industry Failure to qualify as a REIT would result in material adverse tax consequences and would significantly reduce cash available for distributions We believe that we operate so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, also known as the Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of technical and complex legal provisions for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. In addition, no assurance can be given that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT or the Federal income tax consequences of such qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to Federal, state and local income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for amounts distributed to shareholders. In addition, unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost. The additional tax would reduce significantly our net income and the cash available for distributions to shareholders. We are subject to certain distribution requirements that may result in our having to borrow funds at unfavorable rates To obtain the favorable tax treatment associated with being a REIT, we are required, among other things, to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) each year. To the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to Federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which certain distributions paid by us with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. As a result of differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses, and the inclusion of such income and the deduction of such expenses in arriving at taxable income, and the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves and the timing of required debt service (including amortization) payments, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis in order to make the distributions to our shareholders necessary to retain the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT, even if we believe that then prevailing market conditions are not generally favorable for such borrowings. Such borrowings could reduce our net income and the cash available for distributions to holders of our shares. Compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to maximize profits In order to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things, our sources of income, the amounts we distribute to our shareholders and the ownership of securities. We may also be required to make distributions to shareholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Accordingly, compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of such issuer. In addition, no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer, other than a qualified REIT security. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we must dispose of the portion of our assets in excess of such amounts within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our REIT status and suffering adverse tax consequences. This requirement could cause us to dispose of assets for consideration of less than their true value and could lead to a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you of our ability to pay dividends in the future We intend to pay quarterly dividends and to make distributions to our shareholders in amounts such that all or substantially all of our taxable income in each year, subject to certain adjustments, is distributed. This, along with other factors, should enable us to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to a REIT under the Code. We have not established a minimum dividend payment level and our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, maintenance of our REIT status and such other factors as our board of trustees may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends in the future. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K, together with other statements and information publicly disseminated by us contains certain-forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
