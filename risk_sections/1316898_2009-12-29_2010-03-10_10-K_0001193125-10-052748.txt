risk factors above). As a result, the shares of Series B Preferred represent, in the aggregate, more than 36% of the voting power of our equity securities and may therefore have considerable influence in determining the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. The holders of the Series B Preferred also have significant control over the composition of our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and the Securities Purchase Agreement confer significant power upon the holders of the Series B Preferred in the election or nomination of members of our Board. Currently, the holders of Series B-1 Preferred have the right to elect two members of our Board and the holders of the Series B-2 Preferred have the right to elect one member of our Board. Under certain circumstances, the holders of Series B Preferred may be entitled to elect additional directors. Upon conversion of the Series B Preferred into common stock, assuming certain ownership thresholds continue to be met, the holders of Series B Preferred will have contractual rights to nominate members to our Board. Because the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred will have the right to designate these members to our Board, they have considerable influence on the composition of our Board and, therefore, the conduct of our business. The Series B Preferred is redeemable at the option of the holders under certain circumstances. On or after June 16, 2016, the holders of at least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series B Preferred may require us to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred. The redemption price per share of the Series B Preferred is equal to the greater of (i) the sum of (A) the liquidation preference per share of the Series B Preferred (which initially is $115 per share, subject to adjustment, plus all Dividend Arrearages), plus (B) an amount per share of the Series B Preferred equal to accrued but unpaid dividends not previously added to the liquidation preference from and including the immediately preceding dividend payment date up to, but excluding, the date proposed for such redemption, whether or not declared, in cash, or (ii) the amount of all cash and other property to be distributed in respect of our common stock the holder of a share of the Series B Preferred would have been entitled to had it converted such share (without regard to any limits on conversion) immediately prior to the date proposed for such redemption. Depending on our cash resources at the time that this redemption right is exercised, we may or may not be able to fund the redemption from our available cash resources. If we were unable to fund the redemption from available cash resources we would need to find an alternative source of financing to do so. There can be no assurances that we would be able to raise such funds on favorable terms or at all if they are required. 28 Table of Contents We have agreed to give the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred the right to participate in subsequent stock issuances. We agreed that if we issue and sell any new equity securities after June 16, 2009, subject to certain exceptions, we will give the Series B Purchasers the right to purchase a portion of those new securities so as to permit each of them to maintain their proportional ownership in our stock as long as such purchaser beneficially owns at least 25% of the shares such purchaser originally purchased on June 16, 2009. The existence of this right may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing from third parties that do not wish to have Series B Purchasers participating in their financing. The Series B Preferred private placement could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient determined by dividing $115 (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares) by the then applicable conversion price. The initial conversion price of the Series B Preferred is $1.15 per share. Upon such conversion, the Company must pay the Dividend Arrearage, if any, on each share of Series B Preferred, plus an amount per share of Series B Preferred equal to accrued but unpaid dividends not previously added to the liquidation preference from and including the immediately preceding dividend payment date up to, but excluding, the applicable date of conversion, whether or not declared. The holder of a share of Series B Preferred may elect to convert that holderÂ’s share at any time. In addition, after June 16, 2011, we have the right to force conversion of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred upon certain conditions being met. Sales in the public market of the shares of common stock acquired upon conversion of shares of the Series B Preferred or exercise of the Advisor Warrant, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise funds in additional stock financings.
