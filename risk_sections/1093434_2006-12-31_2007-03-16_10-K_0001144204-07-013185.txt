RISK FACTORS Investing on our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider these risks as well as information we include or incorporate by reference in this prospectus. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and you may lose some or all of your investment. Risks of Our Current Business We have incurred significant losses throughout our history and may not be profitable in the future. Since our inception, we have incurred net losses of approximately $2.5 billion. We only recently began to implement our new IP-centric business strategy. There is no assurance that we will be able to operate this new IP business profitably or to report net income in the future and realize the value of our substantial tax loss carryforwards. Our IP-centric business is new, and we may not be successful in operating or expanding it. We do not have an established history of acquiring IP, or IP-centric businesses, and managing IP assets and businesses. We began to implement our IP-centric business in June 2006, when we acquired UCC. Upon the closing of that acquisition, Mr. D’Loren, who was the president and chief executive officer of UCC, became our president and chief executive officer. During their tenure with UCC, Mr. D’Loren and the other members of our senior management team were involved primarily in providing banking, finance, consulting and other advisory services to IP-centric businesses. They did not own or manage an IP-centric business directly. As a result, we may encounter unanticipated difficulties or challenges as we work to implement our new business strategy. If we are unable to address and overcome such difficulties or challenges, we may not be successful with our new business strategy. We are dependent upon our president and chief executive officer, Robert W. D’Loren. If we lose Mr. D’Loren’s services, we may not be able to successfully implement our IP business strategy. The successful implementation of our IP business strategy will depend primarily upon the efforts of Mr. D’Loren, our president and chief executive officer. Mr. D’Loren is the person primarily responsible for conceiving of and implementing our IP business strategy. Although we have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. D’Loren that runs through June 2009, there is no guarantee that he will remain employed by us throughout the period. If he ceases to work with us, or if his services are reduced, we will need to identify and hire other qualified executives, and we may not be successful in finding or hiring adequate replacements. This could impede our ability to fully implement our IP business strategy, which would harm our business and prospects. The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which could reduce the market price of our common stock and, among other things, make it more expensive for us to complete acquisitions using our stock as consideration. Since we announced the acquisition of UCC and the hiring of Mr. D’Loren, the trading price of our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility could reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could change significantly over short periods of time in response to actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results, announcements by us or by third parties on whom we rely or against whom we compete, factors affecting the markets in which we do business or changes in national or regional economic conditions. If our stock price declines, we may be required to issue additional shares to complete acquisitions, which would make them more dilutive to our stockholders. The market price of our common stock also could be reduced by general market price declines or market volatility in the future or future declines or volatility in the prices of stocks for companies against whom we compete or companies in the industries in which our licensees compete. 9 We are unlikely to become profitable unless we can identify and acquire IP and IP-centric businesses on favorable terms. Our ability to achieve our business objective of becoming profitable will depend on our ability to identify and acquire suitable acquisitions on favorable terms, so that we can increase our revenues and generate net income. If we are unable to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, our new IP business will be very limited and may not generate sufficient revenues to cover our expenses. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete any future acquisitions or that such transactions, if completed, will contribute positively to our operations and financial results and condition. We are involved in litigation with respect to a business that we sold in 2005. In 2005, we sold our mobile transportation business to Geologic Solutions, Inc. Since that time, Geologic has notified us of, and we have responded to, various indemnification claims for alleged breaches of representations and warranties under the asset purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold the transportation business to Geologic. We were unable to resolve these claims with Geologic, and in March 2006, Geologic filed a lawsuit against us in state court in New York. Geologic’s claims primarily involve allegations that we did not fully disclose certain aspects of our transportation business’ relationships with one of its major customers and two of its major suppliers that allegedly resulted in the devaluation of inventory and other adverse effects to the business. Geologic contends that it has suffered damages in excess of $30 million as a result of these alleged breaches. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to Geologic’s claims and is vigorously defending against them. However, we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation, and an adverse resolution of such claims could require us to make a significant cash payment to Geologic. In such event, we would record a charge against earnings, further increasing the loss on the sale of the transportation business, and decreasing the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions and operations. Any failure to meet our debt obligations would adversely affect our business and financial condition. On March 12, 2007, we entered into a new $150 million master loan agreement with BTMU Capital Corporation. As of March 14, 2007, we have approximately $26.5 million of long-term debt outstanding, and expect to draw an additional $46 million shortly to refinance the acquisitions of Bill Blass, MaggieMoo’s and Marble Slab. Interest rates for our master loan agreement vary based upon utilization and whether the borrowings are at the base rate or the London Interbank Offering Rate ("LIBOR"). Our master loan agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for senior secured credit facilities, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, loans, acquisitions, capital expenditures, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, common stock repurchases, dividends and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries and sale leaseback transactions. Our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in a default under the indebtedness, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These restrictions may also limit our ability to operate our businesses and may prohibit or limit our ability to enhance our operations or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. As a result of our indebtedness, we will need to use a portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest, which will reduce the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business. The master loan agreement may also limit our ability to obtain future financings which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth. The amount of our debt may also cause us to be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Risks of Our Acquisition Strategy Competition may negatively affect our ability to complete suitable acquisitions. We believe that there are a limited number of other companies competing for acquisitions of the type that we are seeking. However, we will face competition for acquisitions, and competition may increase as the business strategy we are pursuing continues to receive publicity. Existing and future competitors may be larger than us and have access to greater financial and other resources. As a result, acquisitions may become more expensive, and we may face greater difficulty in identifying suitable acquisition candidates on terms that we believe will make sense. If we are unable to expand our business by completing acquisitions on favorable terms, our financial results may be negatively affected. 10 Acquisitions involve numerous risks that we may not be able to address or overcome, and could result in acquisitions that negatively affect our business and financial results. Even if we are successful in completing IP-centric acquisitions, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability levels that will justify our investments in those acquisitions. Among other things, we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions, including various synergies and economies of scope and scale. Each acquisition involves numerous risks, any of which could have a detrimental effect on our results of operations and/or the value of our equity. These risks include, among others: · overpaying for acquired assets or businesses; · being unable to license, market or otherwise exploit IP that we acquire on anticipated terms or at all; · negative effects on reported results of operations from acquisition-related expenses and amortization or impairment of acquired intangibles; · diversion of management's attention from management of day-to-day operational issues; · failing to maintain focus on, or ceasing to execute, core strategies and business plans as our IP portfolio grows and becomes more diversified; · failing to acquire or hire additional successful managers, or being unable to retain critical acquired managers; · potential adverse effects of a new acquisition on an existing business or business relationship; and · underlying risks of the businesses that we acquire, which may differ from one acquisition to the next, including those related to entering new lines of business or markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Our ability to grow through the acquisition of additional IP assets and business will depend on the availability of capital to complete acquisitions. We financed the acquisitions of The Athlete’s Foot, Bill Blass, MaggieMoo’s and Marble Slab with a combination of cash and equity, and we intend to finance our future IP acquisitions through a combination of available cash, bank or other institutional financing, and issuances of equity and possibly debt securities. As of March 14, 2007, we had approximately $39 million of cash on hand after borrowing $26.5 million under the new senior credit facility we entered into on March 12, 2007. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure borrowings in the future to fund acquisitions, either on terms that we consider reasonable or at all. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, we face limitations on the number of shares of equity that we can issue without triggering limitations on our future ability to use our substantial accumulated tax loss carry forwards. Under certain circumstances, these limitations (if triggered) could significantly or, under certain circumstances, totally reduce the future value of our tax loss carry forwards (assuming we are able to generate taxable income that would benefit from the use of the tax loss carry forwards). As a result of these factors, we may lack access to sufficient capital to complete acquisitions that we identify and want to complete. In such a case, our inability to complete acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial results and the trading price of our stock. We operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our Athlete’s Foot franchisees operate in over 40 countries. In addition, the brands and other IP assets that we acquire and manage are currently used, and in the future are expected to be used, for products and services that will be advertised and sold in many different countries. As a result. we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities for our IP business outside the United States, which could expose us to greater risks. The risks associated with our IP business outside the United States include: 11 · Political and economic instability or civil unrest; · Armed conflict, natural disasters or terrorism; · Health concerns or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic; · Multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that differ between jurisdictions; · Changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements effecting trade and investment; · Differences from one country to the next in legal protections applicable to IP assets, including trademarks and similar assets, enforcement of such protections and remedies available for infringements; · Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; and · Adverse consequences from changes in tax laws. The effects of these risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse impact on our IP business. Risks of Businesses We Acquire Our business will depend on market acceptance of the IP that we intend to acquire such as trademarks, brands and franchise rights. We expect these markets to be highly competitive. Continued market acceptance of the IP that we intend to acquire, such as trademarks, brands and franchise rights is critical to our future success and subject to great uncertainty. The consumer branded products industries on which we expect to focus our acquisition activities are extremely competitive, both in the United States and overseas. Accordingly, we expect that we and our future licensees and other business partners (including franchisees) will face intense and substantial competition with respect to marketing and expanding products and services under acquired IP. As a result, we may not be able to attract licensees, franchisees and other business partners on favorable terms or at all. In addition, licensees and other third parties with whom we deal may not be successful in selling products and services that make use of our acquired IP. They (and we) also may not be able to expand the distribution of such products and services into new markets. In general, competitive factors include quality, price, style, name recognition and service. In addition, the presence in the marketplace of short-lived “fads” and the limited availability of shelf space can affect competition for many consumer products. Changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing products and outlets also can affect market results. Competing trademarks and brands may have the backing of companies with greater financial, distribution, marketing, capital and other resources than do us or our licensees and other business partners. This may increase the obstacles that we and they face in competing successfully. Among other things, we may have to spend more on advertising and marketing or may need to reduce the amounts that we charge licensees and other business partners. This could have a negative impact on our business and financial results. Because we expect to rely on unaffiliated third parties to market, distribute, sell and in some cases design products and services using IP such as trademarks and brands that we license, the success of our business may depend upon various factors that are beyond our control. We expect to have limited personnel and operations. Substantially all of our earnings are expected to come from royalties generated from licensees, franchisees and similar contractual relationships involving IP that we acquire. Licensees, franchisees and other business partners are independent operators, and we will not exercise day-to-day control over any of them. As a result, our business will face a number of risks, including the following: · We expect that products using our IP will be manufactured by third party licensees, either directly or through third-party manufacturers on a subcontract basis. All manufacturers have limited production capacity, and the ones with whom we work (directly or indirectly) may not, in all instances, be able to satisfy manufacturing requirements for our (and our licensees’) products. · We expect to provide limited training and support to franchisees. Consequently, franchisees may not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel. 12 · While we will try to ensure that our licensees and other business partners maintain a high quality of products and services that use our IP, they may take actions that adversely affect the value of our IP or our business reputation. Our failure to protect proprietary rights that we acquire could decrease the value of those assets. We expect to acquire a combination of trademarks, copyrights, franchise rights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights. The success of our IP business strategy will depend in part on our ability to license this intellectual property for use by third parties in selling various products and services and developing brand and product awareness in new geographic and product markets. Although we expect that much of our intellectual property will be protected by registration or other legal rules in the United States, in some cases registration may not be in place or available, particularly outside of the United States. In some cases, third parties may be using similar trademarks or other intellectual property in certain countries, and we may not be able to use certain of our intellectual property in those countries. We intend to monitor on an ongoing basis unauthorized filings of registrations for our trademarks and other intellectual property and to rely primarily upon a combination of trademark, copyright, know-how, trade secrets and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that such measures afford only limited protection and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that actions taken in the past, or that we take in the future, to establish and protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent infringement by others, or prevent a loss of revenue or other damages. In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may be required to spend significant time and money on protecting or defending our intellectual property rights. We may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce legal protections that we believe apply to intellectual property that we acquire, including to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects, regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights. In addition, to the extent that any of the intellectual property we acquire is deemed to violate the proprietary rights of others, we could be prevented from using it, which could cause a termination of licensing and other commercial arrangements. This would adversely affect our revenues and cash flow. We also could be required to defend litigation brought against us, which can be costly and time-consuming. It could also result in a judgment or monetary damages being levied against us. The acquisition of IP assets and IP-centric businesses will result in us recording a material amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are required to write down a portion of this goodwill and other intangible assets, our financial results would be adversely affected. As a result of our acquisition strategy, certain identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives which meet specified accounting criteria will consist of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. We will not amortize goodwill. We may not be able to realize the full fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill from our acquisitions. We will evaluate on at least an annual basis whether all or a portion of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired. Any write-down of intangible assets or goodwill resulting from future periodic evaluations would decrease our net income, and those decreases could be material. Material weaknesses in disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting of the businesses we acquire could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information. The integration of acquisitions includes ensuring that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting effectively apply to and address the operations of newly acquired businesses. While we will make every effort to thoroughly understand any acquired entity’s business processes, our planning for proper integration into our company can give no assurance that we will not encounter operational and financial reporting difficulties impacting our controls and procedures. As a result, we may be required to change our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting to accommodate newly acquired operations, and we may also be required to remediate historic weaknesses or deficiencies at acquired businesses. Our review and evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls of the companies we acquire may take time and require additional expense, and if they are not effective on a timely basis could adversely affect our business and the market’s perception of our company. 13 Risks of Our Tax Loss Carry Forwards We may not be able to realize value from our tax loss carry forwards. As of December 31, 2006, we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $777 million that expire between 2011 and 2026. In addition, we had capital loss carry forwards of approximately $251 million that expire between 2006 and 2011. If we had an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards generated prior to the ownership change would be subject to annual limitations, which could reduce, eliminate, or defer the utilization of these losses. Based upon a review of past changes in our ownership, as of December 31, 2006, we do not believe that we have experienced an ownership change (as defined under section 382) that would result in any limitation on our future ability to use these net operating loss and capital loss carry forwards. However, we can not assure you that the IRS or some other taxing authority may not disagree with our position and contend that we have already experienced such an ownership change, which would severely limit our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income. Generally, an ownership change occurs if one or more stockholders, each of whom owns 5% or more in value of a corporation’s stock, increase or decrease their aggregate percentage ownership by 50% or more as compared to the lowest percentage of stock owned by such stockholders at any time during the preceding three-year period. For example, if a single stockholder owning 10% of our stock acquired an additional 50% of our stock in a three-year period, a change of ownership would occur. Similarly, if ten persons, none of whom owned our stock, each acquired slightly over 5% of our stock within a three-year period (so that such persons own, in the aggregate more than 50%) an ownership change would occur. Ownership of stock is determined by certain constructive ownership rules which can attribute ownership of stock owned by entities (such as estates, trusts, corporations, and partnerships) to the ultimate indirect owner. For purposes of this rule, all holders who each own less than 5% of a corporation’s stock are generally treated together as one (or, in certain cases, more than one) 5% stockholder. Transactions in the public markets among stockholders owning less than 5% of the equity securities generally are not included in the calculation. Special rules can result in the treatment of options (including warrants) or other similar interests as having been exercised if such treatment would result in an ownership change. On July 12, 2005, our stockholders approved a holding company reorganization in which each share of what was then Aether Systems common stock was exchanged for one share of common stock of a new holding company (then called Aether Holdings, and now called NexCen Brands). As a result of this transaction, shares of our common stock are subject to transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation. In general, the transfer restrictions prohibit any person from acquiring more than 5% of our stock without our consent. Persons who owned 5% or more of our stock prior to May 4, 2005 are permitted to sell the shares owned as of May 4, 2005 without regard to the transfer restrictions. Shares acquired by such persons after May 4, 2005 are subject to the transfer restrictions. While we expect that these transfer restrictions will help guard against an ownership change occurring under section 382 and the related rules, because we are using stock as consideration to make acquisitions, and because we may decide (or need) to sell additional shares of our common stock in the future to raise capital for our business and because persons who held more than 5% of our stock prior to these restrictions taking effect can sell (and in some cases have sold) shares of our stock, we cannot guarantee that these restrictions will prevent a change of ownership from occurring. We may not be able to use our tax loss carry forwards because we may not generate taxable income. The use of our net operating loss carry forwards is subject to uncertainty because it is dependent upon the amount of taxable income we generate. Similarly, the extent of our actual use of our capital loss carry forwards is also subject to uncertainty because their use depends on the amount of capital gains we generate. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income (or capital gains) in future years to use the net operating loss carry forwards or capital loss carry forwards before they expire. This is especially true for our capital loss carry forwards, because they expire over a shorter period of time than our net operating loss carry forwards. The IRS could challenge the amount of our tax loss carry forwards. The amount of our net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards has not been audited or otherwise validated by the IRS. The IRS could challenge the amount of our net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards, which could result in an increase in our liability for income taxes. In addition, calculating whether an ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainty, both because of the complexity and ambiguity of section 382 and because of limitations on a publicly traded company’s knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the calculation of the amount of our net loss carry forwards may not be changed as a result of a challenge by a governmental authority or our learning of new information about the ownership of, and transactions in, our securities. 14 We expect to be subject to state, local and foreign taxes, as well as the alternative minimum tax. Our net loss carry forwards would not offset the alternative minimum tax in its entirety. We will continue to be subject to state, local and foreign taxes. As a result of our capital loss carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards, we anticipate our federal income tax liability over the next several years will be reduced substantially. However, we expect to be subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which limits the use of net operating loss carry forwards. These provisions would result, in effect, in 10% of our alternative minimum taxable income being subject to the 20% alternative minimum tax assessed on corporations. This amounts to a 2% effective tax rate on our alternative minimum taxable income. The IRS may seek to impose the accumulated earnings tax on some or all of the taxable income we retain. We expect to retain all or a substantial portion of future earnings over the next several years to finance the development and growth of our IP business. As a result, we may not declare or pay any significant dividends on shares of our common stock for an extended period. If the IRS believed we were accumulating earnings beyond our reasonable business needs, the IRS could seek to impose an accumulated earnings tax, or AET, of 15% on our accumulated taxable income. We do not believe that we will be subject to the AET due to various reasons, including the existence of our large deficit in accumulated earnings and profits. However, the IRS may disagree with us on this point, and the IRS may attempt to impose the AET on all or a portion of our taxable income. In such event, we would expect to challenge any attempt by the IRS to impose the AET on our business, but the outcome of such a challenge is uncertain. If we distributed our accumulated taxable income for each year to our stockholders as dividends, we would not be subject to the AET for the amounts so distributed, but would be subject to the AET only for the amount of earnings retained. If we paid dividends to stockholders out of current earnings, these dividends would, generally speaking, be eligible to be treated as “qualified dividends” for federal income tax purposes, taxed at the current maximum federal rate of 15%, assuming that the recipient stockholder met the various requirements under the Internal Revenue Code for such treatment. The maximum rate for qualified dividends is currently projected to increase to the maximum federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income (currently 35%) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2008 in accordance with the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. Limits on ownership of our common stock could have an adverse consequence to you and could limit your opportunity to receive a premium on our stock. As noted above, it is important that we avoid an ownership change under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, in order to retain the ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards to offset future income. Under transfer restrictions that have been applicable to our common stock since 2005, no one is permitted to acquire 5% or more of our stock without the consent of our Board of Directors. In addition, even if our Board of Directors consented to a significant stock acquisition, a potential buyer might be deterred from acquiring our common stock while we still have significant tax losses being carried forward, because such an acquisition might trigger an ownership change and severely impair our ability to use our tax losses against future income. Thus, this potential tax situation could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could affect adversely our shareholders’ ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for our common stock in connection with a change in control. The transfer restrictions that apply to shares of our common stock, although designed as a protective measure to avoid an ownership change, may have the effect of impeding or discouraging a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, even if such a transaction may be favorable to the interests of some or all of our shareholders. This effect might prevent our stockholders from realizing an opportunity to sell all or a portion of their common stock at a premium to the prevailing market price. ITEM 1B.
