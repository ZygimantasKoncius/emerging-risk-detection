ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Introduction Current and potential investors in the Company should be aware that, as with any publicly traded company, investing in our securities carries risk. Managing risk effectively is paramount to our success, and our organization is built around intelligent risk assumptions and careful risk management, as evidenced by our development of the PartnerRe risk management framework, which provides an integrated approach to risk across the entire organization. We have identified what we believe reflect key significant risks to the organization, and in turn the shareholders. These risks should be read in conjunction with other Risk Factors described in more detail below under the heading Risk Factors. First, in order to achieve our targeted growth in book value per share of 10% a year, we believe we must be able to generate approximately 13% operating ROE. Our ability to do that over a reinsurance cycle is dependent on our individual performance, but also on industry factors that impact the level of competition and the level of cost. The level of competition is determined by supply and demand of capacity. Demand is determined by client buying behavior, which varies based on the clients perception of the amount and volatility of risk, its financial capacity to bear it and the cost of risk transfer. Supply is determined by the existing reinsurance companies level of financial strength and the introduction of capacity from new start-ups or capital markets. Significant new capacity or significant reduction in demand will depress industry profitability until the supply/demand balance is redressed. Extended periods of imbalance could depress industry profitability to a point where we would fail to meet our targets. Second, we knowingly expose ourselves to significant volatility in our quarterly and annual net income. We create shareholder value by assuming risk from the insurance and capital markets. This exposes us to volatile earnings as untoward events happen to our clients and in the capital markets. Examples of potential large loss events include, without limitation:  Natural catastrophes such as hurricane, windstorm, flood, earthquake, etc.  Man-made disasters such as terrorism  Declines in the equity and credit markets  Systemic increases in the frequency or severity of casualty losses  New mass tort actions or reemergence of old mass torts such as asbestosis We manage large loss events through evaluation processes, which are designed to enable proper pricing of these risks over time, but which do little to moderate short-term earnings volatility. The only effective tool to 26 Table of Contents manage earnings volatility is through diversification by building a portfolio of uncorrelated risks. We do not currently buy significant amounts of retrocessional coverage, nor do we use significant capital market hedges or trading strategies in the pursuit of stability in earnings. Third, we expose ourselves to several very significant risks that are of a size that can impact our financial strength as measured by U.S. GAAP or regulatory capital. We believe that the following are categorized as very significant risks:  Catastrophe risk  Casualty reserving risk  Equity investment risk Each of these risks can accumulate to the point that they exceed a years worth of earnings and affect the capital base of the Company (for further information about these risks see Other Key Issues of ManagementRisk Management in Item 7 of Part II of this report). We rely on our internal risk management processes, models and systems to manage these risks at the nominal exposure levels approved by the Companys Board. However, because these models and processes may fail, we also impose limits on our exposure to these risks. In addition to these enumerated risks, we face numerous other strategic and operational risks that could in the aggregate lead to shortfalls to our long-term goals or add to short-term volatility in our earnings. The following review of important risk factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements that are included herein or elsewhere. The words or phrases believe, anticipate, estimate, project, plan, expect, intend, hope, forecast, evaluate, will likely result or will continue or words or phrases of similar import generally involve forward-looking statements. As used in these Risk Factors, the terms we, our or us may, depending upon the context, refer to the Company, to one or more of the Companys consolidated subsidiaries or to all of them taken as a whole. 27 Table of Contents Risk Factors Our profitability is affected by the cyclical nature of the reinsurance industry. Historically, the reinsurance industry has experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition, levels of available capacity, trends in cash flows and losses, general economic conditions and other factors. Demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by underwriting results of primary insurers, including catastrophe losses, and prevailing general economic conditions. The supply of reinsurance is related directly to prevailing prices and levels of capacity that, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being realized in the reinsurance industry. If any of these factors were to result in a decline in the demand for reinsurance or an overall increase in reinsurance capacity, our profitability could be impacted. We operate in a highly competitive environment. The reinsurance industry is highly competitive and we compete with a number of worldwide reinsurance companies, including, but not limited to, Berkshire Hathaways General Re, Everest Re Group Ltd, Hannover Re, Lloyds, Munich Re, Swiss Re, SCOR Group, Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. and reinsurance operations of certain primary insurance companies, such as ACE Limited, Arch Capital, and Axis Capital. Competition in the types of reinsurance that we underwrite is based on many factors, including the perceived financial strength of the reinsurer, pricing, terms and conditions offered, services provided, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment and experience in the lines of reinsurance to be written. If competitive pressures reduce our prices, we would expect to write less business. In addition, competition for customers would become more intense and we could incur additional expenses relating to customer acquisition and retention, further reducing our operating margins. The current state of the economy and capital markets increases the possibility of adverse effects on our financial position and results of operations. Economic downturns could impair our investment portfolio and affect the primary insurance market, which could, in turn, harm our operating results and reduce our volume of new business. During 2008 and continuing into 2009, the capital markets in the United States and abroad experienced a severe economic downturn and certain economies remain in recession. Disruptions in the capital markets have increased the spread between the yields realized on risk-free and higher risk securities. While the increased spreads have reduced during the latter half of 2009, illiquidity remains in certain parts of the debt capital markets. The longer this economic dislocation persists, the greater the probability that these risks could have an adverse effect on our financial results. This may be evidenced in several ways, including but not limited to a potential reduction in our premium income, financial losses in our investment portfolio and decreases in revenue and net income. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could prevent us from increasing our underwriting activities and negatively impact our operating results. In addition, our cedants and other counterparties may be affected by such developments in the financial markets, which could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. Political, regulatory, governmental and industry initiatives could adversely affect our business. Our reinsurance operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental and non-governmental self-regulatory authorities in each of their respective jurisdictions. As a result of the current financial crisis, some of these authorities are or may in the future consider enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or otherwise assure the stability of institutions under their supervision. These authorities may also seek to exercise their supervisory 28 Table of Contents authority in new and more robust ways, and new regulators could become authorized to oversee parts of our business. It is not possible to predict the future impact of these types of changes but if they did occur they could affect the way we conduct our business and manage our capital, and may require us to satisfy increased capital requirements, any of which, in turn, could affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our main subsidiaries regulatory environments are described in detail under the heading Regulation. Regulations relating to each of our main subsidiaries may in effect restrict each of those subsidiaries ability to write new business, to make certain investments and to distribute funds or assets to us. Recent government intervention and the possibility of future government intervention have created uncertainty in the insurance and reinsurance markets. Government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of others, including shareholders of reinsurers. In light of the current financial crisis, we believe it is likely there will be increased regulation of, and other forms of government participation in, our industry in the future, which could adversely affect our business by, among other things:  Providing reinsurance capacity in markets and to clients that we target or requiring our participation in industry pools and guaranty associations;  Further restricting our operational or capital flexibility;  Expanding the scope of coverage under existing policies;  Regulating the terms of reinsurance policies; or  Disproportionately benefiting the companies of one country over those of another. Such a federal initiative was put forward in response to the tightening of supply in certain insurance and reinsurance markets resulting from, among other things, the September 11th tragedy, and consequently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) was enacted to ensure the availability of commercial insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts in the U.S. In December 2007, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) was enacted, which further renewed TRIA for another 7 years ending December 31, 2014. Such a state initiative was put forward by the Florida Legislature in response to the tightening of supply in certain insurance and reinsurance markets in Florida resulting from, among other things, hurricane damage in Florida, which enacted the Hurricane Preparedness and Insurance Act to ensure the availability of catastrophe insurance coverage for catastrophes in the state of Florida. The insurance industry is also affected by political, judicial and legal developments that may create new and expanded theories of liability, which may result in unexpected claim frequency and severity and delays or cancellations of products and services we provide, which could adversely affect our business. If we are downgraded by rating agencies by two notches or more, our standing with brokers and customers could be negatively impacted and may adversely impact our results of operations. Third party rating agencies assess and rate the claims paying ability and financial strength of insurers and reinsurers, such as the Companys subsidiaries. These ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies and have become an important factor in establishing our competitive position in the market. They are not an evaluation directed to investors in our common shares, preferred shares or debt securities, and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our common shares, preferred shares or debt securities. Rating agencies may downgrade or withdraw their ratings at their sole discretion. 29 Table of Contents Our current financial strength ratings are: PartnerRe Standard & Poors AA- Moodys Aa3 A.M. Best A+ Fitch AA Paris Re Standard & Poors A+ A.M. Best A Following the announcement of the Companys proposed acquisition of Paris Re, Moodys and A.M. Best affirmed the Companys ratings, while Standard & Poors (S&P) and Fitch affirmed the Companys ratings but revised their outlook to negative from stable, with S&P citing concerns about potential integration risks (including the Companys ability to integrate the culture and risk management cultures of both organizations) as well as potential earnings dilution, and Fitch citing uncertainty over whether the combined entity will generate returns and stability of returns that are commensurate with those required at the Companys current rating level. Following the completion of the 100% acquisition of Paris Re, both S&P and A.M. Best upgraded Paris Res ratings to one notch below the PartnerRe rating with an outlook of positive on December 3, 2009 and January 21, 2010, respectively. Further upgrades are dependent on the timing and structure of the integration. If our ratings were significantly downgraded, by two notches or more, our competitive position in the reinsurance industry may suffer, and it could result in a reduction in demand for our products, In addition, certain business that we write contains terms that give the ceding company or derivative counterparty the right to terminate cover and/or require collateral if our ratings are downgraded significantly. We may suffer losses due to defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities, reinsurance and derivative counterparties. Issuers or borrowers whose securities we hold, reinsurers, clearing agents, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, fraud or other reasons. Our investment portfolio may include investment securities in the financial services sector that have recently experienced defaults. All or any of these types of default could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The exposure of our investments to interest rate, credit and equity risks may limit our net income and may affect the adequacy of our capital. We invest the net premiums we receive until such time as we pay out losses. Investment results comprise a substantial portion of our income. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we had net investment income of $596 million, which represented approximately 11% of total revenues. In addition, we recorded realized ($81 million) and unrealized ($511 million) gains on investments during 2009, and we record all realized and unrealized gains or losses through net income. While our Management has implemented what it believes to be prudent risk management and investment asset allocation practices, we are exposed to significant financial and capital market risks, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, market volatility, the performance of the economy in general and other factors outside our control. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies of major economies, including the U.S., inflation, economic and political conditions and other factors outside our control. Changes in interest rates can negatively affect us in two ways. In a declining interest rate environment, we will be required to invest our funds at lower rates, which would have a negative impact on investment income. In a rising interest rate environment, the market value of our fixed income portfolio may decline. 30 Table of Contents Our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in high quality, investment grade securities. However, we invest a smaller portion of the portfolio in securities that are below investment grade, including high yield fixed income investments, bank loans, and convertible fixed income investments. These securities pay a higher rate of interest and have a higher degree of credit or default risk. These securities may also be less liquid in times of economic weakness or market disruptions. We invest a portion of our portfolio in preferred and common stocks or equity-like securities. The value of these assets fluctuates with equity markets. In times of economic weakness, the market value and liquidity of these assets may decline, and may impact net income and capital. We use the term equity-like investments to describe our investments that have market risk characteristics similar to equities and are not investment grade fixed income securities. This category includes bank loans, high yield fixed income investments, private equity investments and derivative exposure assumed. Fluctuations in the fair value of our equity-like investments may reduce our income in any period or year and cause a reduction in our capital. Since we rely on a few reinsurance brokers for a large percentage of our business, loss of business provided by these brokers could reduce our premium volume and net income. We produce our business both through brokers and through direct relationships with insurance company clients. For the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 72% of our gross premiums were produced through brokers. In 2009, we had two brokers that accounted for 44% of our gross premiums written. Because broker-produced business is concentrated with a small number of brokers, we are exposed to concentration risk. A significant reduction in the business produced by these brokers would reduce our premium volume and net income. We are exposed to credit risk relating to our reinsurance brokers and cedants. In accordance with industry practice, we may pay amounts owed under our policies to brokers, and they in turn pay these amounts to the ceding insurer. In some jurisdictions, if the broker fails to make such an onward payment, we might remain liable to the ceding insurer for the deficiency. Conversely, the ceding insurer may pay premiums to the broker, for onward payment to us in respect of reinsurance policies issued by us. In certain jurisdictions, these premiums are considered to have been paid to us at the time that payment is made to the broker, and the ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we have actually received the premiums. We may not be able to collect all premiums receivable due from any particular broker at any given time. We also assume credit risk by writing business on a funds withheld basis. Under such arrangements, the cedant retains the premium they would otherwise pay to us to cover future loss payments. We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully, the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, and our ability to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. We may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. Equity financings could be dilutive to our existing shareholders and could result in the issuance of securities that have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our other securities. Financial markets in the U.S. and elsewhere have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent times, resulting in part from financial stresses affecting the liquidity of the banking system. Continued disruption in the financial markets may limit our ability to access capital required to operate our business and we may be forced to delay raising capital or bear a higher cost of capital, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. 31 Table of Contents If actual losses exceed our estimated loss reserves, our net income and capital position will be reduced. Our success depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we reinsure. We establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the contracts that we write. Loss reserves are estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given time to reflect our expectation of the costs of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims. Losses for casualty and liability lines often take a long time to be reported, and frequently can be impacted by lengthy, unpredictable litigation and by the inflation of loss costs over time. As a consequence, actual losses and loss expenses paid may deviate substantially from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements. Although we did not operate prior to 1993, we assumed certain asbestos and environmental exposures through our acquisitions, including Paris Re. Our reserves for losses and loss expenses include an estimate of our ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claims for which we cannot estimate the ultimate value using traditional reserving techniques, and for which there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of our potential losses. We and certain of our subsidiaries have received and continue to receive notices of potential reinsurance claims from ceding insurance companies, which have in turn received claims asserting asbestos and environmental losses under primary insurance policies, in part reinsured by us. Such claims notices are often precautionary in nature and are generally unspecific, and the primary insurers often do not attempt to quantify the amount, timing or nature of the exposure. Given the lack of specificity in some of these notices, and the legal and tort environment that affects the development of claims reserves, the uncertainties inherent in valuing asbestos and environmental claims are not likely to be resolved in the near future. In addition, the reserves that we have established may be inadequate. If ultimate losses and loss expenses exceed the reserves currently established, we will be required to increase loss reserves in the period in which we identify the deficiency to cover any such claims. As a result, even when losses are identified and reserves are established for any line of business, ultimate losses and loss expenses (that is, the administrative costs of managing and settling claims) may deviate, perhaps substantially, from estimates reflected in loss reserves in our financial statements. Variations between our loss reserve estimates and actual emergence of losses could be material and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may be adversely affected if Colisée Re, AXA or their affiliates fail to honor their obligations to Paris Re or its clients. As part of the AXA Acquisition, Paris Re entered into 2006 Acquisition Agreements. See Summary of certain agreements between AXA SA, Colisée Re and Paris Re above. Pursuant to the Quota Share Retrocession Agreement, the benefits and risks of Colisée Res reinsurance agreements, including those entered into following the AXA Acquisition pursuant to the Issuance Agreement entered into between Colisée Re and Paris Re France on December 21, 2006, were ceded to Paris Re, but Colisée Re remains both the legal counterparty for all such reinsurance contracts and the legal holder of the assets relating to such reserves. Under the Run Off Services and Management Agreement, Paris Re has agreed that AXA LM will manage claims arising from all reinsurance and retrocession contracts subject to the Reserve Agreement. 32 Table of Contents If AXA LM does not take into account Paris Res commercial concerns in the context of Paris Res on-going business relations with the relevant ceding companies and retrocessionaires, our ability to renew reinsurance and retrocession contracts with them may be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that our business activities, financial condition, results or future prospects may not be adversely affected in spite of the existence of the 2006 Acquisition Agreements. In general, if AXA or its affiliates breach or do not satisfy their obligations under the 2006 Acquisition Agreements (whether as a result of insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of the 2006 Acquisition Agreements), we could be materially adversely affected. The volatility of the catastrophe business that we underwrite will result in volatility of our earnings. Catastrophe reinsurance comprises approximately 10% of our net premiums written and a larger percentage of our capital at risk. Catastrophe losses result from events such as windstorms, hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, floods, hail, tornadoes, severe winter weather, fires, explosions and other man-made or natural disasters, the incidence and severity of which are inherently unpredictable. Because catastrophe reinsurance accumulates large aggregate exposures to man-made and natural disasters, our loss experience in this line of business could be characterized as low frequency and high severity. This is likely to result in substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year, and may create downward pressure on the market price of our common shares and limit our ability to make dividend payments and payments on our debt securities. Notwithstanding our endeavors to manage our exposure to catastrophic and other large losses, the effect of a single catastrophic event or series of events affecting one or more geographic zones, or changes in the relative frequency or severity of catastrophic or other large loss events, could reduce our earnings and limit the funds available to make payments on future claims. The effect of an increase in frequency of mid-size losses in any one reporting period affecting one or more geographic zones, such as an unusual level of hurricane activity, could also reduce our earnings. Should we incur more than one very large catastrophe loss, our ability to write future business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to replenish our capital. By way of illustration, during the past five calendar years, the Company incurred the following pre-tax large catastrophe losses, net of reinstatement premiums (in millions of U.S. dollars): Calendar year Pre-tax large catastrophe losses 2009 $ 2008 305 2007 50 2006  2005 900 Paris Res pre-tax large catastrophe losses are not reflected in the above table. Subsequent to the completion of the Paris Re acquisition, our exposure to natural and man-made disasters may be different than our historical exposure and may have increased. The loss incurred in 2007 was as the result of one large catastrophe event, whereas the losses in 2008 and 2005 were incurred as the result of multiple large catastrophe events. We believe, and recent scientific studies have indicated, that the frequency of Atlantic basin hurricanes has increased and may change further in the future relative to the historical experience over the past 100 years. As a result of changing climate conditions, such as global warming, there may be increases in the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and the losses that result from them. We monitor and adjust, as we believe appropriate, our risk management models to reflect our judgment of how to interpret current developments and information, such as these studies. 33 Table of Contents We could face unanticipated losses from man-made catastrophic events and these or other unanticipated losses could impair our financial condition, reduce our profitability and decrease the market price of our shares. We may have substantial exposure to unexpected, large losses resulting from future man-made catastrophic events, such as acts of terrorism, acts of war and political instability, or from other perils. Although we may attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverage we write, we may continue to have exposure to such unforeseen or unpredictable events. This may be because, irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of policy language, there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will not limit enforceability of policy language or otherwise issue a ruling adverse to us. It is also difficult to predict the timing of such events with statistical certainty, or estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate. Under U.S. GAAP, we are not permitted to establish reserves for potential losses associated with man-made or other catastrophic events until an event that may give rise to such losses occurs. If such an event were to occur, our reported income would decrease in the affected period. In particular, unforeseen large losses could reduce our profitability or impair our financial condition. Our debt, credit and International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) agreements may limit our financial and operational flexibility, which may affect our ability to conduct our business. We have incurred indebtedness, and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Additionally, we have entered into credit facilities and ISDA agreements with various institutions. Under these credit facilities, the institutions provide revolving lines of credit to us and our major operating subsidiaries and issue letters of credit to our clients in the ordinary course of business. The agreements relating to our debt, credit facilities and ISDA agreements contain various covenants that may limit our ability, among other things, to borrow money, make particular types of investments or other restricted payments, sell assets, merge or consolidate. Some of these agreements also require us to maintain specified ratings and financial ratios, including a minimum net worth covenant. If we fail to comply with these covenants or meet required financial ratios, the lenders or counterparties under these agreements could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them. If we are in default under the terms of these agreements, then we would also be restricted in our ability to declare or pay any dividends, redeem, purchase or acquire any shares or make a liquidation payment. If any one of the financial institutions that we use in our operations, including those that participate in our credit facilities, fails or is otherwise unable to meet their commitments, we could incur substantial losses and reduced liquidity. We maintain cash balances significantly in excess of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits at various depository institutions. We also have funding commitments from a number of banks and financial institutions that participate in our credit facilities. See Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCredit Facilities. Access to funds under these existing credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding requirements. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding requirements if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time, and we might be forced to replace credit sources in a difficult market. There have also been recent consolidations in the banking industry which could lead to increased reliance on and exposure to a limited number of institutions. If we cannot obtain adequate financing or sources of credit on favorable terms, or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted. 34 Table of Contents Changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results. Developments in accounting practices, for example a convergence of U.S. GAAP with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), may require considerable additional expense to comply, particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively. The impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted, but may affect the results of our operations, including among other things, the calculation of net income. Legal and enforcement activities relating to the insurance industry could affect our business and our industry. The insurance industry has experienced substantial volatility as a result of litigation, investigations and regulatory activity by various insurance, governmental and enforcement authorities concerning certain practices within the insurance industry. These practices include the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance or other non-traditional or loss mitigation insurance and reinsurance products. These investigations have resulted in changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets and industry business practices. While at this time, none of these changes have caused an adverse effect on our business, we are unable to predict the potential effects, if any, that future investigations may have upon our industry. Emerging claim and coverage issues could adversely affect our business. Unanticipated developments in the law, as well as changes in social and environmental conditions could potentially result in unexpected claims for coverage under our insurance, reinsurance and other contracts. These developments and changes may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. With respect to our casualty businesses, these legal, social and environmental changes may not become apparent until some time after their occurrence. Our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by an increase in insurance and reinsurance contract disputes, arbitration and litigation. The full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict. As a result, the full extent of our liability under our coverages, and in particular, our casualty reinsurance contracts, may not be known for many years after a contract is issued. If our non-U.S. operations become subject to U.S. income taxation, our net income will decrease. We believe that we and our non-U.S. subsidiaries have operated, and will continue to operate, our respective businesses in a manner that will not cause us to be viewed as engaged in a trade or business in the United States and, on this basis, we do not expect that either we or our non-U.S. subsidiaries will be required to pay U.S. corporate income taxes (other than potential withholding taxes on certain types of U.S.-source passive income). Because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the United States, the IRS may contend that either we or our non-U.S. subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the United States. If either we or our non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to U.S. income tax, our shareholders equity and earnings will be reduced by the amount of such taxes, which might be material. PartnerRe U.S. Corporation and its subsidiaries conduct business in the United States, and are subject to U.S. corporate income taxes. If proposed legislation previously introduced in both Houses of Congress is reintroduced and passed, our individual U.S. shareholders may no longer qualify for current capital gains rates on our dividends. Currently, our individual U.S. shareholders are taxed on dividends paid in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011 at advantageous capital gains rates rather than ordinary income tax rates. Proposed legislation 35 Table of Contents has been introduced in both Houses of Congress that would exclude shareholders of a foreign corporation from this advantageous treatment unless either (i) the corporation is organized or created in a country that has entered into a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S. or (ii) the stock of such corporation is readily tradable on an established securities market in the U.S., and the corporation is organized or created in a country that has a comprehensive income tax system that the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury determines is satisfactory for this purpose. We would not satisfy either of these tests and, accordingly, if this legislation is reproposed and becomes law, individual U.S. shareholders would no longer qualify for the advantageous capital gains rates on our dividends. It is not possible to predict whether similar legislation might be reintroduced and enacted in the future. The impact of Bermudas letter of commitment to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in Bermuda. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has published reports and launched a global initiative among member and non-member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition. These measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world. Bermuda was not listed in the most recent report as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices, to embrace international tax standards for transparency, to exchange information and to eliminate an environment that attracts business with no substantial domestic activity. We are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes. If proposed U.S. legislation is passed, our U.S. reinsurance subsidiary may be subject to higher U.S. taxation and our net income would decrease. Currently, our U.S. reinsurance subsidiary retrocedes or may retrocede a portion of its U.S. business to our Non-U.S. reinsurance subsidiaries and is generally entitled to deductions for premiums paid for such retrocessions. Proposed legislation has been introduced that if enacted would impose a limitation on such deductions, which could result in increased U.S. tax on this business and decreased net income. It is not possible to predict whether this or similar legislation may be enacted in the future. We are a holding company, and if our subsidiaries do not make dividend and other payments to us, we may not be able to pay dividends or make payments on our debt securities and other obligations. We are a holding company with no operations or significant assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries and other intercompany balances. We have cash outflows in the form of operating expenses, interest payments related to our long-term debt, dividends to both common and preferred shareholders and, from time to time, cash outflows for principal repayments related to our long-term debt, and the repurchase of common shares under our share repurchase program. We rely primarily on cash dividends and payments from our subsidiaries to meet our cash outflows. We expect future dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to be the principal source of funds to pay expenses and dividends. The payment of dividends by our reinsurance subsidiaries is limited under Bermuda, Irish, Swiss and French laws and certain statutes of various U.S. states in which our U.S. subsidiaries are licensed to transact business. As of December 31, 2009, there were no significant restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Companys subsidiaries that would limit the Companys ability to pay common and preferred shareholders dividends and its corporate expenses. Because we are a holding company, our right, and hence the right of our creditors and shareholders, to participate in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary of ours, upon our liquidation or reorganization or otherwise, is subject to the prior claims of policyholders and creditors of these subsidiaries. Investors may encounter difficulties in service of process and enforcement of judgments against us in the United States. We are a Bermuda company and some of our directors and officers are residents of various jurisdictions outside the United States. All, or a substantial portion, of the assets of our officers and directors and of our assets 36 Table of Contents are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the United States. Although we have appointed an agent and irrevocably agreed that the agent may be served with process in New York with respect to actions against us arising out of violations of the United States Federal securities laws in any Federal or state court in the United States, it could be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States on our directors and officers who reside outside the United States. It could also be difficult for investors to enforce against us or our directors and officers judgments of a United States court predicated upon civil liability provisions of United States Federal securities laws. There is no treaty in force between the United States and Bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As a result, whether a United States judgment would be enforceable in Bermuda against us or our directors and officers depends on whether the United States court that entered the judgment is recognized by the Bermuda court as having jurisdiction over us or our directors and officers, as determined by reference to Bermuda conflict of law rules. A judgment debt from a United States court that is final and for a sum certain based on United States Federal securities laws will not be enforceable in Bermuda unless the judgment debtor had submitted to the jurisdiction of the United States court, and the issue of submission and jurisdiction is a matter of Bermuda law and not United States law. In addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues, Bermuda courts will not enforce a United States Federal securities law that is either penal or contrary to public policy. An action brought pursuant to a public or penal law, the purpose of which is the enforcement of a sanction, power or right at the instance of the state in its sovereign capacity will not be entered by a Bermuda court. Certain remedies available under the laws of United States jurisdictions, including certain remedies under United States Federal securities laws, would not be available under Bermuda law or enforceable in a Bermuda court, as they would be contrary to Bermuda public policy. Further, no claim can be brought in Bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of United States Federal securities laws because these laws have no extra jurisdictional effect under Bermuda law and do not have force of law in Bermuda. A Bermuda court may, however, impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under Bermuda law. Operational risks, including human or systems failures, are inherent in our business. Operational risks and losses can result from many sources including fraud, errors by employees, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply with regulatory requirements or information technology failures. We believe our modeling, underwriting and information technology and application systems are critical to our business and reputation. Moreover, our technology and applications have been an important part of our underwriting process and our ability to compete successfully. Such technology is and will continue to be a very important part of our underwriting process. We have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties. We cannot be certain that we will have access to these, or comparable service providers, or that our technology or applications will continue to operate as intended. In addition, we cannot be certain that we would be able to replace these service providers or consultants without slowing our underwriting response time. A major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could result in management distraction, harm to our reputation, a loss or delay of revenues or increased expense. The continued integration of Paris Re into our business following the acquisition may present significant challenges and may result in the incurrence of significant costs. We may face significant challenges, including regulatory, technical, accounting and other challenges, in combining Paris Res operations into our operations in a timely and efficient manner and in retaining key personnel. Furthermore, management resources may be diverted for an extended period of time to accomplish this integration. The failure to successfully integrate Paris Re and to successfully manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in our not achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction. In 37 Table of Contents addition, we have been and will continue to incur integration and restructuring costs as we integrate the businesses of Paris Re with our businesses. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental integration and restructuring costs over time, we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, if at all. Foreign currency fluctuations may reduce our net income and our capital levels. Through our multinational reinsurance operations, we conduct business in a variety of foreign (non-U.S.) currencies, the principal exposures being the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Swiss franc and the Singapore dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and exchange rate fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar may materially impact our results and financial position. We employ various strategies (including hedging) to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. To the extent that these exposures are not fully hedged or the hedges are ineffective, our results or equity may be reduced by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Provisions in our bye-laws may restrict the voting rights of our shares and may restrict the transferability of our shares. Our bye-laws generally provide that if any person owns, directly, indirectly or by attribution, more than 9.9% of our outstanding shares (including our common and preferred shares), the voting rights attached to such shares will be reduced so that such person may not exercise and is not attributed more than 9.9% of the total voting rights. In addition, our board of directors may limit a shareholders exercise of voting rights where it deems it necessary to do so to avoid non-de minimis adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequences to us, any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders. Under our bye-laws, subject to waiver by our board of directors, no transfer of our shares is permitted if such transfer would result in a shareholder controlling more than 9.9% of our outstanding shares. Our bye-laws also provide that if our board of directors determines that share ownership by a person may result in non-de minimis adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequences to us, any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders, then we have the option, but not the obligation, to require that shareholder to sell to us for fair market value the minimum number of shares held by such person which is necessary to eliminate the non-de minimis adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequences. We also have the authority under our bye-laws to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholders voting rights are to be limited pursuant to our bye-laws. If a shareholder fails to respond to our request for information or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to a request by us, we may, in our sole discretion, eliminate the shareholders voting rights. The loss of key executive officers could adversely affect us. Our success has depended, and will continue to depend, partly upon our ability to attract and retain executive officers. If any of these executives ceased to continue in his or her present role, we could be adversely affected. We believe there are only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which we compete. Our ability to execute our business strategy is dependent on our ability to attract and retain a staff of qualified underwriters and other key personnel. The skills, experience and knowledge of the reinsurance industry of our management team constitute important competitive strengths. If some or all of these managers leave their positions, and even if we were able to find persons with suitable skills to replace them, our operations could be adversely affected. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
