ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The Company faces a number of significant risks associated with its current plan of operations. These include the following: We have never generated any significant revenues, have a history of losses, and cannot assure you that we will ever become or remain profitable. We have not yet generated any significant revenue from operations and, accordingly, we have incurred net losses every year since our inception. To date, we have dedicated most of our financial resources to research and development, general and administrative expenses and initial sales and marketing activities. We have funded all of our activities through sales of our securities. Even if and when we begin licensing our technology, we anticipate net losses and negative cash flow to continue for the foreseeable future until such time as licensing revenue is generated in sufficient amounts to offset operating losses. As planned, we have significantly expanded both our research and development efforts, and our sales and marketing efforts, during the past year. Consequently, we will need to generate significant additional revenue to fund our operations. This has put a proportionate corresponding demand on capital. Our ability to achieve profitability is dependent upon our continuing research and development, product development, and sales and marketing efforts, and our ability to successfully license our BioLargo technology. There can be no assurance that we will ever generate revenues or that any revenues that may be generated will be sufficient for us to become profitable or thereafter maintain profitability. We may also face unforeseen problems, difficulties, expenses or delays in implementing our business plan. We need significant additional funds to maintain and develop our business. As of December 31, 2007 our expenses ran at a burn rate of approximately $150,000 per month. Our current capital resources will be sufficient to fund operations only through approximately July 2008, and we will require substantial additional capital in order to sustain our operations, develop our business, fund research and development, and implement our business plan during the year ending December 31, 2008 and beyond. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise capital. Although Management is in discussions to arrange for one or more such financings of up to approximately $10 million in the aggregate, in the form of bridge and/or permanent financings, the Company cannot assure you that it will successfully negotiate or obtain such additional financing, or that it will obtain financing on acceptable or favorable terms. There are no commitments in place for such financings at this time. If we cannot obtain needed capital, when and as we need it, our continuing research and development efforts, sales and marketing plans, business and financial condition and our ability to reduce losses and generate profits are likely to be materially and adversely affected. 13 Table of Contents The Company expects that any commitments for additional financings will be in the form of best efforts financings. The Companys ability to obtain additional capital depends on market conditions, the economy and others factors, many of which are outside the Companys control. If we cannot obtain needed capital, our research and development, and marketing plans, business and financial condition and our ability to reduce losses and generate profits are likely to be materially and adversely affected. The Companys failure to secure necessary financing would likely have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. There are several specific business opportunities we are considering in further development of our business. None of these opportunities is yet the subject of a definitive agreement and most or all of these opportunities will require additional funding obligations on our part, for which funding is not currently in place. In furtherance of our business plan, we are presently considering a number of opportunities to promote our business, to further develop and broaden, and to license, our technology with third parties. While discussions are underway with respect to such opportunities, there are no definitive agreements in place with respect to any of such opportunities at this time, other than the two product evaluation agreements discussed in further detail. There can be no assurance that any such opportunities being discussed will result in definitive agreements or, if definitive agreements are entered into, that they will be on terms that are favorable to us. Moreover, most if not all of these other opportunities, should they result in definitive agreements being entered into, would require us to expend additional monies above and beyond our current operating budget to promote such endeavors. No such financing is in place at this time for such endeavors and we cannot assure you that any such financing will be available, or if it is available whether it will be on terms that are favorable to the company. The cost of maintaining our public company reporting obligations is high. We expect to incur increased costs under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company is obligated to maintain its periodic public filings and public reporting requirements, on a timely basis, under the Rules and Regulations of the SEC. In order to meet these obligations, the Company will need to continue to raise capital. If adequate funds are not available to the Company, it will be unable to comply with those requirements and could cease to be qualified to have its stock traded in the public market. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as related rules adopted by the SEC, has imposed substantial requirements on public companies, including certain corporate governance practices and requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Although, under rules issued by the SEC, as currently in effect, we are required to evaluate, to document and test our internal control procedures under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules of the SEC until our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in helping prevent financial fraud generally. We must begin to implement proper procedures significantly in advance of this date and will incur significant up-front expenses to do so. If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed. Our stockholders face further potential dilution in any new financing. Any additional equity that we raise would dilute the interest of the current stockholders and any persons who may become stockholders before such financing. Given the low price of our common stock, such dilution in any financing of a significant amount could be substantial. 14 Table of Contents Our stockholders face further potential adverse effects from the terms of any preferred stock which may be issued in the future. In order to raise capital to meet expenses or to acquire a business, our Board of Directors may issue additional stock, including preferred stock. Any preferred stock which we may issue may have voting rights, liquidation preferences, redemption rights and other rights, preferences and privileges. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and in many respect subordinate to, the rights of the holders of any such preferred stock. Furthermore, such preferred stock may have other rights, including economic rights, senior to our common stock that could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock. Preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, can also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock, thereby delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company. There are significant risks relating to our BioLargo technology. Our BioLargo technology is at an early stage of development. There is a risk that our BioLargo technology will not be commercially feasible or, even if our BioLargo technology is commercially feasible, it may not be commercially accepted. In addition, products incorporating our BioLargo technology will require extensive research, development and testing before they can be commercialized. Many of these potential products, if any, also may involve lengthy regulatory reviews and require regulatory approval before they can be sold. There is no assurance, however, that any products incorporating our BioLargo technology will prove to be safe and effective, meet regulatory standards or continue to meet such standards if already approved. There is no assurance that we can market our BioLargo technology successfully as a licensor. Failure to achieve commercial feasibility, demonstrate safety, achieve clinical efficacy, obtain regulatory approval and/or, together with partners, successfully market products will negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. As a company in the development stage and with an unproven business strategy, our limited history of operations makes evaluation of our BioLargo technology as a business difficult. We may not attain profitable operations and our management may not succeed in realizing our business objectives. We expect to incur future losses and may not be able to achieve profitability. Although we expect to generate revenue in the nearer-term from product evaluation and/or product development agreements, and eventually from licensing our BioLargo technology, as well as possibly engaging in certain limited direct sales of products under certain conditions, we anticipate net losses and negative cash flow to continue for the foreseeable future until such time as our products are brought to market, and for a period of time thereafter. We intend to significantly expand our research and development efforts. Consequently, we will need to generate significant additional revenue or seek additional funding to fund our operations. This has put a proportionate corresponding demand on capital. Our ability to achieve profitability is entirely dependent upon our research and development efforts to deliver a viable product and our ability to successfully bring it to market. Although our management is optimistic that we will succeed in licensing our BioLargo technology, we cannot be certain as to timing or whether we will generate sufficient revenue to be able to operate profitably. If we cannot achieve or sustain profitability, we may not be able to fund our expected cash needs or continue our operations. If we are not able to devote adequate resources to promote commercialization of our BioLargo technology, our business plans will suffer. Because we have limited resources to devote to sales, marketing and licensing efforts with respect to our BioLargo technology, any delay in such efforts may jeopardize future research and development of technologies, and commercialization of our BioLargo technology. Although our management believes that it can finance commercialization efforts through sales of our securities and possibly other capital sources, if we do not successfully bring our BioLargo technology to market, our ability to generate revenues will be adversely affected. 15 Table of Contents Many of the products incorporating our BioLargo technology will require regulatory approval. The products in which our BioLargo technology may be incorporated have both regulated and non-regulated applications. The regulatory approvals for certain applications may be difficult, impossible, time consuming and or expensive to obtain. While the management believes such approvals can be obtained for the applications contemplated, until those approvals from the FDA or the EPA or other regulatory bodies, if required, at the federal and state levels, as may be required are obtained, then the Company may not be able to generate commercial revenues. Certain specific regulated applications and its use therein require highly technical analysis, additional third party validation and will require regulatory approvals from organizations like the FDA. Certain applications may also be subject to additional state and local agency regulations, increasing the cost and time associated with commercial strategies. Additionally, most products incorporating our BioLargo technology that may be sold in the European Union (EU) will require EU and possibly also individual country regulatory approval. All such approvals, including additional testing, are time-consuming, expensive and do not have assured outcomes of ultimate regulatory approval. We need to outsource and rely on third parties for the manufacture of the chemicals, material components or delivery apparatus used in our BioLargo technology and part of our future success will be dependent on the timeliness and effectiveness of the efforts of these third parties. We do not have the required financial and human resources or capability to manufacture the chemicals that comprise our BioLargo technology. Our business model calls for the outsourcing of the manufacture of these chemicals in order to reduce our capital and infrastructure costs as a means of potentially improving our financial position and the profitability of our business. Accordingly, we must enter into agreements with other companies that can assist us and provide certain capabilities, including sourcing and manufacturing, which we do not possess. We may not be successful in entering into such alliances on favorable terms or at all. Even if we do succeed in securing such agreements, we may not be able to maintain them. Furthermore, any delay in entering into agreements could delay the development and commercialization of our BioLargo technology or reduce its competitiveness even if they reach the market. Any such delay related to such future agreements could adversely affect our business. If any party to which we have outsourced certain functions fails to perform its obligations under agreements with us, the commercialization of our BioLargo technology could be delayed or curtailed. To the extent that we rely on other companies to manufacture the chemicals used in our BioLargo technology, or sell or market products incorporating our BioLargo technology, we will be dependent on the timeliness and effectiveness of their efforts. If any of these parties does not perform its obligations in a timely and effective manner, the commercialization of our BioLargo technology could be delayed or curtailed because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue such efforts on our own. If our BioLargo technology or products incorporating our BioLargo technology do not gain market acceptance, it is unlikely that we will become profitable. The market for disinfecting or sanitizing products that are used to transport biohazardous material, serve as an absorbent pad or clean-up device, and utilized for food applications or remediation efforts, is rapidly evolving and we have many successful competitors. Multiple manufacturers have historically used various technologies, including protective boxes, styrofoam boxes, gel packs, absorbent materials, bed pads, drapes, and clean up pads, to package blood products for transportation; and to sanitize, deodorize, and clean up, as well as protect workers and patients in healthcare and other applicable environments. At this time, our BioLargo technology is unproven in its commercial use, and the use of our BioLargo technology by others is nominal. The commercial success of products incorporating our BioLargo technology will depend upon the adoption of our BioLargo technology by biohazardous material transporters, biohazardous material storage and testing companies, healthcare workers, hospitals, nursing homes, infectious disease experts and other end users as an approach to reduce the risk of disease transfer and disease containment and related biohazardous materials handling, among other applications. 16 Table of Contents Market acceptance may depend on many factors, including:  the willingness and ability of consumers and industry partners to adopt new technologies;  the willingness of governments to mandate reduction of the rates of incidence of disease transfer, reduction of risk of spills and leaks associated with biohazardous materials and as a general safety measure, as well as regulatory approvals (e.g. FDA or EPA) in certain applications where our BioLargo technology may be used;  our ability to convince potential industry partners and consumers that our BioLargo technology is an attractive alternative to other technologies for disinfection, sanitization, remediation, reduction of disease transfer and as a protective and safety device against biohazardous materials;  our ability to obtain the chemicals from third parties that are used in our BioLargo technology, in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost; and  our ability to license our BioLargo technology in a commercial effective manner. If products incorporating our BioLargo technology do not achieve a significant level of market acceptance, demand for our BioLargo technology itself may not develop as expected and, in such event, it is unlikely that we will become profitable. Any revenues that we may earn in the future are unpredictable, and our operating results are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We believe that our future operating results will fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including:  delays in product development by us or third parties;  market acceptance of products incorporating our BioLargo technology;  changes in the demand for, and pricing, of products incorporating our BioLargo technology;  competition and pricing pressure from competitive products;  manufacturing delays; and  expenses related to, and the results of, proceedings relating to our intellectual property. We expect our operating expenses will continue to increase significantly in 2008 and beyond, as we continue our research and development, and increase our marketing and licensing activities. Although we expect to generate revenues from licensing our BioLargo technology in the future, revenues may decline or not grow as anticipated and our operating results could be substantially harmed for a particular fiscal period. Moreover, our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors. In that case, our stock price most likely would decline. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified senior personnel. We believe we are currently able to manage our current business with our existing management team. However, as we expand the scope of our operations, we will need to obtain the full-time services of additional senior management and other personnel. Competition for highly-skilled personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain qualified senior personnel. Our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan. As we add full-time senior personnel, our overhead expenses for salaries and related items will increase from current levels and, depending upon the number of personnel we hire and their compensation packages, these increases could be substantial. 17 Table of Contents If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, we may be unable to achieve profitability. Our future success is substantially dependent on the efforts of our senior management, particularly Dennis Calvert, our president and chief executive officer, and Kenneth Reay Code, our chief technology officer. The loss of the services of either of these officers or other members of our senior management may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of product development and other business objectives. Because of the scientific nature of our business, we depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain qualified marketing, scientific and technical personnel. There is intense competition among specialized and technologically-oriented companies for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities. If we lose the services of, or do not successfully recruit key marketing, scientific and technical personnel, the growth of our business could be substantially impaired. At present, we do not maintain key man insurance for any of our senior management. Changes in stock option accounting rules may adversely affect our reported operating results, our stock price, and our ability to attract and retain employees. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has implemented rules that require companies such as us to record all stock-based employee compensation as an expense. The new rules apply to stock options grants, as well as a wide range of other share-based compensation arrangements including restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans. As a small company with limited financial resources, we have depended upon compensating our officers, directors, employees and consultants with such stock based compensation awards in the past in order to limit our cash expenditures and to attract and retain officers, directors, employees and consultants. Accordingly, if we continue to grant stock options or other stock based compensation awards to our officers, directors, employees, and consultants after the new rules apply to us, our future earnings, if any, will be reduced (or our future losses will be increased) by the expenses recorded for those grants. These compensation expenses may be larger than the compensation expense that we would be required to record were we able to compensate these persons with cash in lieu of securities. Since we are a small company, the expenses we may have to record as a result of future options grants may be significant and may materially negatively affect our reported financial results. The adverse effects that the new accounting rules may have on our future financial statements should we continue to rely heavily on stock-based compensation may reduce our stock price and make it more difficult for us to attract new investors. In addition, reducing our use of stock plans as an incentive for and a reward to our officers, directors and employees, could result in a competitive disadvantage to us in the employee marketplace. Nondisclosure agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information. In order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on nondisclosure agreements with our employees, licensing partners, consultants, agents and other organizations to which we disclose our proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. Since we rely on trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, in addition to patents, to protect some of our intellectual property, there is a risk that third parties may obtain and improperly utilize our proprietary information to our competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. 18 Table of Contents The licensing of our BioLargo technology or the manufacture, use or sale of products incorporating our BioLargo technology may infringe on the patent rights of others, and we may be forced to litigate if an intellectual property dispute arises. If we infringe or are alleged to have infringed another partys patent rights, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. In addition, if we do not obtain a license, do not successfully defend an infringement action or are unable to have infringed patents declared invalid, we may:  incur substantial monetary damages;  encounter significant delays in marketing our current and proposed product candidates;  be unable to conduct or participate in the manufacture, use or sale of product  Candidates or methods of treatment requiring licenses;  lose patent protection for our inventions and products; or  find our patents are unenforceable, invalid, or have a reduced scope of protection. Parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive relief that could effectively block the companys ability to further develop or commercialize our current and proposed product candidates in the United States and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such license could substantially harm the company. Litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in substantial cost to, and a diversion of efforts by, the Company. We may face costly intellectual property disputes. Our ability to compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of our technology and either to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others or to obtain rights to technology owned by third parties. Pending patent applications relating to our BioLargo technology may not result in the issuance of any patents or any issued patents that will offer protection against competitors with similar technology. Patents we receive may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in the future or the rights created by those patents may not provide a competitive advantage. We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing invention to develop and maintain our competitive position. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. We are subject to risks related to future operations outside of North America. Over time, we expect to develop operations outside of North America, and as those efforts are pursued, we will face risks related to our foreign operations such as:  foreign currency fluctuations;  unstable political, economic, financial and market conditions;  import and export license requirements;  trade restrictions;  increases in tariffs and taxes;  high levels of inflation;  restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States;  greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; 19 Table of Contents  less favorable intellectual property laws;  Regulatory requirements;  unfamiliarity with foreign laws and regulations; and  changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. The volatility of certain raw material costs may adversely affect operations and competitive price advantages for products that incorporate our BioLargo technology. While most of the chemicals and other key materials that we use in our business, such as minerals, fiber materials, and packaging materials are neither generally scarce nor price sensitive, but prices for such chemicals and materials can be cyclical. SAP beads, which are a petrochemical derivative, have been subject to periodic scarcity and price volatility from time to time during recent years, although prices are relatively stable at present. Supply and demand factors, which are beyond our control, generally affect the price of our raw materials. We try to minimize the effect of price increases through production efficiency and the use of alternative suppliers. If we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. There are potential claims from prior business affiliates of IOWC regarding the BioLargo technology. During the history of the development of the BioLargo technology, Mr. Code previously assigned the two patents registered with the USPTO, which we acquired in April 2007, to a third party company. Mr. Code believes that the agreement between IOWC, Mr. Code and this other party was breached and terminated, and such parties have no rights to any part of our BioLargo technology. Nonetheless, such parties, or their successors or assigns, could make claims of rights of ownership to all or some portion of our BioLargo technology. In the event of a legal dispute, a lengthy and costly legal defense would be required to defend against any such claims, and notwithstanding the Companys position in these potential disputes, the Company cannot predict the outcome of such litigation. Loss of our ownership of our BioLargo technology would have a serious adverse affect on our business and plan of operations. Any financial settlement of claims, including royalties we might have to pay to third parties, could have a serious adverse affect on our results of operations. Because Mr. Code and an entity he controls hold the majority of our voting power, he can ensure the outcome of most matters on which our stockholders vote. In connection with the completion of the acquisition of certain intellectual property and other assets from IOWC on April 30, 2007, as approved by the Companys stockholders on March 15, 2007, the Company issued an aggregate 22,139,012 shares, or approximately 56.3% of the Companys then issued and outstanding common stock, to IOWC, a company which Mr. Code controls. As a result of this issuance, combined with Mr. Codes previous stockholdings in the Company, Mr. Code controls 22,759,649 shares, or approximately 57.8% of the then total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and is now the principal stockholder of the Company. Under Delaware law, as a result of Mr. Codes stockholdings, he has the power to elect each of the members of our board of directors. Mr. Code also has the power to control the outcome of most matters requiring stockholder approval. This control may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of our company, such as a merger or sale of the company. Mr. Code is a member of our board of directors and also serves as an executive officer of the Company. Our common stock is thinly traded and largely illiquid. Our stock is currently quoted on the OTCBB. Being quoted on the OTCBB has made it more difficult to buy or sell our stock and from time to time has lead to a significant decline in the frequency of trades and trading 20 Table of Contents volume. Continued trading on the OTCBB will also likely adversely affect the Companys ability to obtain financing in the future due to the decreased liquidity of the Companys shares and other restrictions that certain investors have for investing in OTCBB traded securities. While the Company intends to seek listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq) or another stock exchange when the Company is eligible, there can be no assurance when or if the Companys common stock will be listed on Nasdaq or another stock exchange. The market price of our stock is subject to volatility. Because our stock is thinly traded, its price can change dramatically over short periods, even in a single day. An investment in our stock is subject to such volatility and, consequently, is subject to significant risk. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to many factors, including:  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights;  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;  announcements of new products or new contracts by us or our competitors;  actual or anticipated variations in our operating results due to the level of development expenses and other factors;  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether any future earnings of ours meet or exceed such estimates;  Conditions and trends in our industry;  new accounting standards;  general economic, political and market conditions and other factors; and  the occurrence of any of the risks described in this Report. You may have difficulty selling our shares because they are deemed penny stocks. Because our common stock is not quoted on the Nasdaq National Market or Nasdaq Capital Market or listed on a national securities exchange, if the trading price of our common stock remains below $5.00 per share, trading in our common stock will be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), which require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock (generally, any non-Nasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions). Such rules require the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally defined as an investor with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 individually or $300,000 together with a spouse). For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the sale. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer, current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealers presumed control over the market. Such information must be provided to the customer orally or in writing before or with the written confirmation of trade sent to the customer. Monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of the common stock and the ability of holders of the common stock to sell their shares. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
