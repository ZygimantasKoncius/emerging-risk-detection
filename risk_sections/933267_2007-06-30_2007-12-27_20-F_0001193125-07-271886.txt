D. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report, before making an investment decision. We also may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may impair our business. In general, you take more risk when you invest in the securities of issuers in emerging markets such as Argentina than when you invest in the securities of issuers in the United States. You should understand that an investment in our common shares and GDSs involves a high degree of risk, including the possibility of loss of your entire investment. 14 Table of Contents Risks Relating to Argentina Argentinas current growth and stabilization may not be sustainable. During 2001 and 2002, Argentina experienced a period of severe political, economic and social crisis. Although the economy has recovered significantly over the past three years, uncertainty remains as to whether the current growth and relative stability are sustainable. Sustainable economic growth is dependant on a variety of factors, including international demand for Argentine exports, the stability and competitiveness of the Peso against foreign currencies, confidence among consumers as well as foreign and domestic investors and stable and relatively low inflation. The Argentine economy remains fragile for the following reasons: unemployment remains high; the availability of long-term fixed rate credit is limited; investment as a percentage of GDP remains low; the current fiscal surplus could become a fiscal deficit; the current trade surplus could reverse into a trade deficit; inflation has risen recently and threatens to accelerate; the countrys public debt remains high and international financing is limited; and the recovery has depended to some extent on high commodity prices, which are volatile and outside the control of the country, and excess capacity, which has reduced considerably. A substantial part of our operations, properties and customers are located in Argentina. As a result, our business is to a very large extent dependent upon the economic conditions prevailing in Argentina. Although the economic situation in Argentina has improved, instability is still prevalent and no assurance can be given that macroeconomic conditions in Argentina will not deteriorate again. The continuing rise of inflation may have an adverse effect on the economy. After several years of price stability, the devaluation of the Peso in January 2002 imposed pressures on the domestic price system that generated high inflation throughout 2002. In 2003, inflation substantially stabilized. However, inflationary pressures have since reemerged with consumer prices increasing by 6.1% during 2004 and increasing by 12.3% in 2005. As a result of the execution of fixed price agreements and restrictions on, and in certain cases, suspension of, exports, consumer prices only increased by 9.8% in 2006. As of November 30, 2007, according to the argentine statistics and census agency, or INDEC, consumer prices increased by 8.5% on an annualized basis. In the past, inflation has materially undermined the Argentine economy and the governments ability to create conditions conducive to growth. A return to a high inflation environment could slow the rebound in the long term credit market and real estate market and may also undermine Argentinas foreign competitiveness by diluting the effects of the Peso devaluation and negatively impacting the level of economic activity and employment. 15 Table of Contents If inflation remains high or continues to rise, Argentinas economy may be negatively impacted which could have an adverse effect on our business. Argentinas ability to obtain financing from international markets is limited which may affect its ability to implement reforms and foster economic growth. In the first half of 2005, Argentina restructured part of its sovereign debt that had been in default since the end of 2001. As of March 31, 2007, the Argentine government announced that as a result of the restructuring, it had approximately US$136.3 billion in total outstanding debt remaining. Of this amount, approximately US$26.5 billion are defaulted bonds owned by creditors who did not participate in the restructuring of the external financial debt. Some bondholders in the United States, Italy and Germany have filed legal actions against Argentina, and holdout creditors may initiate new suits in the future. Additionally, foreign shareholders of certain Argentine companies have filed claims in excess of US$17 billion before the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, or ICSID, alleging that certain government measures are inconsistent with the fair and equitable treatment standards set forth in various bilateral treaties to which Argentina is a party. Argentinas past default and its failure to restructure completely its remaining sovereign debt and fully negotiate with the holdout creditors may prevent Argentina from reentering the international capital markets. Litigation initiated by holdout creditors as well as ICSID claims may result in material judgments against the Argentine government and could result in attachments of, or injunctions relating to, assets of Argentina that the government intended for other uses. As a result, the government may not have the financial resources necessary to implement reforms and foster growth which could have a material adverse effect on the countrys economy and, consequently, our business. Significant devaluation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar may adversely affect the Argentine economy as well as our financial performance. Despite the positive effects of the real depreciation of the Peso in 2002 on the competitiveness of certain sectors of the Argentine economy, it has also had a far-reaching negative impact on the Argentine economy and on businesses and individuals financial condition. The devaluation of the Peso has had a negative impact on the ability of Argentine businesses to honor their foreign currency-denominated debt, initially led to very high inflation, significantly reduced real wages, had a negative impact on businesses whose success is dependent on domestic market demand, such as utilities and the financial industry, and adversely affected the governments ability to honor its foreign debt obligations. If the Peso devalues significantly, all of the negative effects on the Argentine economy related to such devaluation could recur, with adverse consequences to our business. Moreover, it would likely result in a decline in the value of our common shares and the GDSs as measured in U.S. dollars. Significant appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar may adversely affect the Argentine economy. A substantial increase in the value of the Peso against the U.S. dollar also presents risks for the Argentine economy. The appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar negatively impacts the financial condition of entities whose foreign currency-denominated assets exceed their foreign currency-denominated liabilities, such as us. In addition, in the short term, a significant real appreciation of the Peso would adversely affect exports. This could have a negative effect on GDP growth and employment as well as reduce the Argentine public sectors revenues by reducing tax collection in real terms, given its current heavy reliance on taxes on exports. The appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar could have an adverse effect on the Argentine economy and our business. 16 Table of Contents Government measures to preempt or respond to social unrest may adversely affect the Argentine economy. During its crisis in 2001 and 2002, Argentina experienced social and political turmoil, including civil unrest, riots, looting, nationwide protests, strikes and street demonstrations. Despite Argentinas ongoing economic recovery and relative stabilization, social and political tension and high levels of poverty and unemployment continue. Future government policies to preempt, or in response to, social unrest may include expropriation, nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, suspension of the enforcement of creditors rights, new taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and changes in laws and policies affecting foreign trade and investment. Such policies could destabilize the country and adversely and materially affect the economy, and thereby our business. Exchange controls and restrictions on transfers abroad and capital inflow restrictions have limited and can be expected to continue to limit the availability of international credit. In 2001 and 2002, Argentina imposed exchange controls and transfer restrictions substantially limiting the ability of companies to retain foreign currency or make payments abroad. These restrictions have been substantially eased, including those requiring the Central Banks prior authorization for the transfer of funds abroad in order to pay principal and interest on debt obligations. However, Argentina may re-impose exchange control or transfer restrictions in the future, among other things, in response to capital flight or a significant depreciation of the Peso. In addition, the government issued Decree No. 616/2005 in June 2005 that established new controls on capital inflows that could result in less availability of international credit. Pursuant to such Decree, the Ministry of Economys Resolution No. 292/2005 was repealed and it was established that any indebtedness in favor of foreign creditors by individuals and legal entities residing in Argentina and conducting business in the private sector must be settled in Argentina and must mature no earlier than 365 days irrespective of the manner of settlement, except in the following cases: transactions related to foreign trade financing, and original issuances of debt instruments admitted to public offering and listed in self-regulated stock exchanges. Therefore, (a) any cash inflows in the domestic foreign exchange market arising from debts incurred with foreign creditors by individuals or legal entities in the private sector and (b) transfer by non-residents to acquire financial assets or liabilities of any kind in the financial and non-financial private sector, excluding direct foreign investment and original issuances of debt instruments admitted to public offering and listed on self-regulated stock exchanges must meet the following requirements: (i) they may be remitted abroad only after expiration of a term of at least 365 days counted after the date on which such funds officially entered the Argentine foreign exchange market; (ii) the amounts resulting from the exchange rate settlement transaction are to be deposited in an account opened at an Argentine banking system institution, (iii) a non-transferable, non-interest bearing deposit of 30% of the amount being settled is to be made in the name of the depositor for a term of 365 days and (iv) such deposit is to be held in U.S. dollars at one of the Argentine banking system institutions and may not be used as guarantee or collateral of any loan. Non-compliance with the requirements laid down in Decree 616/2005 shall be punished in accordance with the Criminal Foreign Exchange Regime. Additional controls could have a negative effect on the economy and our business if imposed in an economic environment where access to local capital is substantially constrained. Moreover, in such event, restrictions on the transfers of funds abroad may impede your ability to receive dividend payments as a holder of GDSs. Payment of dividends to non-residents has been limited in the past and may be limited again. Beginning on February 2002, any payment of dividends, irrespective of amount, outside Argentina needed prior authorization from the Central Bank. In December 2002 the rule was amended through Communication A 3845 which required Argentine companies to obtain prior authorization from the Central Bank to purchase currency in excess of US$150,000 (in the aggregate) per calendar month. This rule applied, among others, to the payment of dividends. 17 Table of Contents On January 7, 2003, the Central Bank issued communication A 3859 which is still enforceable and pursuant to which Argentine companies have no limitation on their ability to purchase foreign currency and transfer it outside Argentina to pay dividends, to the extent such dividend payments result from an approved and audited financial statement. In the future, similar restrictions may be enacted by the Argentine government or the Central Bank again and, if this were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on the value of our common shares and the GDSs. The stability of the Argentine banking system is uncertain. During 2001 and the first half of 2002, a very significant amount of deposits were withdrawn from financial institutions. This massive withdrawal of deposits was largely due to the loss of confidence of depositors in the Argentine governments ability to repay its debts, including its debts within the financial system, and to maintain peso-dollar parity in the context of its solvency crisis. To prevent a run on the U.S. dollar reserves of local banks, the government restricted the amount of money that account holders could withdraw from banks and introduced exchange controls restricting capital outflows. The government subsequently imposed new restrictions and released a schedule stating how and when deposits would become available. These measures taken by the government to protect the solvency of the banking system, in particular the emergency laws that converted certain U.S. dollar-denominated debts into Pesos, generated significant opposition directly against banks from depositors frustrated by the loss of their savings. Many depositors instituted court challenges, eventually at the Supreme Court level, on constitutional grounds seeking restitution of their deposits in their original currency. Under Argentine law, Supreme Court rulings are limited to the particular facts and defendants in the case, although lower courts tend to follow precedent set by the Supreme Court. Initial Supreme Court rulings struck down on constitutional grounds pesification pursuant to Law No. 25,561 (the Public Emergency Law). However, the Supreme Court has found in subsequent holdings that emergency laws enacted by the Argentine Congress were necessary to mitigate the crisis, the regulations were not disproportionate to the emergency, and the measures did not violate the constitutional property rights of those affected. For instance, the Supreme Court held on December 27, 2006 in Massa, Juan Agustin vs. Poder Ejecutivo Nacional y Otro that banks should repay deposits originally denominated in U.S. dollars in Pesos at an exchange rate of Ps.1.40 per US$1.00, subject to CER or Coeficiente de Estabilización de Referencia indexation, plus interest, at a 4% annual rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, numerous other cases challenging the constitutionality of the pesification pursuant to the Public Emergency Law are still pending. We cannot assure you that the Supreme Court will consistently uphold the views expressed in its latest rulings, or that future rulings will not negatively affect the banking system as a whole. If the Argentine government is called upon to provide additional financial assistance to the banks through the issuance of additional government debt, this could add to Argentinas outstanding debt and would increase the burdens of the public sector. While the condition of Argentinas financial system has improved and depositors affected by the restrictions imposed in 2001 and 2002 have regained access to their deposits, albeit mainly in Pesos and subject to certain restrictions, you should not underestimate the long-term implications of the most recent crisis for Argentinas economy and the credibility of its financial system. Adverse economic developments, even if not related to or attributable to the financial system, could easily result in deposits flowing out of the banks and into the foreign exchange market, as depositors seek to shield their financial assets from a new crisis. Any run on deposits could create liquidity or even solvency problems for financial institutions and bring about similar measures or other government interventions. 18 Table of Contents The Argentine economy could be adversely affected by economic developments in other global markets. Financial and securities markets in Argentina are influenced, to varying degrees, by economic and market conditions in other global markets. Although economic conditions vary from country to country, investors perception of the events occurring in one country may substantially affect capital flows into and securities from issuers in other countries, including Argentina. The Argentine economy was adversely impacted by the political and economic events that occurred in several emerging economies in the 1990s, including Mexico in 1994, the collapse of several Asian economies between 1997 and 1998, the economic crisis in Russia in 1998 and the Brazilian devaluation in January 1999. In addition, Argentina continues to be affected by events in the economies of its major regional partners. Furthermore, the Argentine economy may be adversely affected by events in developed economies which are trading partners or that impact the global economy. In the future, political and economic crises in the international markets can be expected to adversely affect the Argentine economy and its financial system and therefore our business. Recent Presidential and Congressional elections may adversely affect the Argentine economy. On October 28, 2007, presidential and congressional elections took place in Argentina. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was elected as President, the ruling party maintained the majority in Congress and as a result there exists uncertainty regarding the economic policy to be carried out by the new government. There are no assurances that future uncertainties preceding and resulting from the Congressional and the Presidential elections will not negatively impact the Argentine economy and/or local bonds and stock markets. Risks Relating to our Business Our performance is subject to risks associated with our properties and with the real estate industry. Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of the securities issued by us, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate sufficient revenues to meet its operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected. Events or conditions beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations or the value of our properties include: downturns in the national, regional and local economic climate; volatility and decline in discretionary spending; competition from other office, industrial and commercial buildings; local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, or other commercial or industrial space; changes in interest rates and availability of financing; the exercise by our tenants of their legal right to early termination of their leases; vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-lease space; increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs; 19 Table of Contents civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses; significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property; declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from them; changes in our ability or our tenants ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance, possibly decreasing the useful life of and revenue from property; and law reforms and governmental regulations (such as those governing usage, zoning and real property taxes). If any one or more of the foregoing conditions were to affect our business, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our investment in property development or redevelopment may be less profitable than we anticipate. We are engaged in the development and construction of office space, retail and residential properties, frequently through third-party contractors. Risks associated with our development, re-development and construction activities include the following, among others: abandonment of development opportunities and renovation proposals; construction costs of a project may exceed its original estimates for reasons including raises in interest rates or increases in the costs of materials and labor, making a project unprofitable; occupancy rates and rents at newly completed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; pre-construction buyers may default on their purchase contracts or units in new buildings may remain unsold upon completion of construction; the unavailability of favorable financing alternatives in the private and public debt markets; sale prices for residential units may be insufficient to cover development costs; construction and lease-up may not be completed on schedule, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs; and we may be unable to obtain, or may face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, or we may be affected by building moratoria and anti-growth legislation. 20 Table of Contents The real estate industry in Argentina is increasingly competitive. Our real estate and construction activities are highly concentrated in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, where the real estate market is highly competitive due to a scarcity of properties in sought-after locations and the increasing number of local and international competitors. Furthermore, the Argentine real estate industry is generally highly competitive and fragmented and does not have high-entry barriers restricting new competitors from entering the market. The main competitive factors in the real estate development business include availability and location of land, price, funding, design, quality, reputation and partnerships with developers. A number of residential and commercial developers and real estate services companies compete with us in seeking land for acquisition, financial resources for development and prospective purchasers and tenants. Other companies, including joint ventures of foreign and local companies, have become increasingly active in the real estate business in Argentina, further increasing this competition. To the extent that one or more of our competitors are able to acquire and develop desirable properties, as a result of greater financial resources or otherwise, our business could be materially and adversely affected. If we are not able to respond to such pressures as promptly as our competitors, or the level of competition increases, our financial condition and results of our operations could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our shopping centers are located in close proximity to other shopping centers, numerous retail stores and residential properties. The number of comparable properties located in the vicinity of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease retail space in our shopping centers or sell units in our residential complexes and on the rent price or the sale price that we are able to charge. We cannot assure you that other shopping center operators, including international shopping center operators, will not invest in Argentina in the near future. As additional companies become active in the Argentine shopping center market, such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We face risks associated with property acquisitions. We have in the past acquired, and intend to acquire in the future, properties, including large properties (such as the acquisition of Abasto de Buenos Aires or Alto Palermo Shopping) that would increase our size and potentially alter our capital structure. Although we believe that the acquisitions that we have completed in the past and that we expect to undertake in the future, have, and will, enhance our future financial performance, the success of such transactions is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the risk that: we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms; acquired properties may fail to perform as expected; the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than we estimate; acquired properties may be located in new markets where we may have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy, absence of business relationships in the area or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and we may not be able to efficiently integrate acquired properties, particularly portfolios of properties, into our organization and to manage new properties in a way that allows us to realize cost savings and synergies. 21 Table of Contents Some of the land we have purchased is not zoned for development purposes, and we may be unable to obtain, or may face delays in obtaining the necessary zoning permits and other authorizations. We own several plots of land which are not zoned for development purposes or for the type of developments we intend to propose, including Santa María del Plata, Puerto Retiro and Terrenos de Caballito. In addition, we do not yet have the required land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in our attempts to rezone land and to obtain all necessary permits and authorizations, or that rezoning efforts and permit requests will not be unreasonably delayed. Moreover, we may be affected by building moratoria and anti-growth legislation. If we are unable to obtain all of the governmental permits and authorizations we need to develop our present and future projects as planned, we may be forced to make unwanted modifications to such projects or abandon them altogether. Acquired properties may subject us to unknown liabilities. Properties that we acquire may be subject to unknown liabilities for which we would have no recourse, or only limited recourse, to the former owners of such properties. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of an acquired property, we might be required to pay significant sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our financial results and cash flow. Unknown liabilities relating to acquired properties could include: liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination; law reforms and governmental regulations (such as those governing usage, zoning and real property taxes); and liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business. Some potential losses are not covered by insurance, and certain kinds of insurance coverage may become prohibitively expensive. We currently carry liability, fire, business interruption, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties. Although we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are generally customary, there are certain types of losses, such as lease and other contract claims and terrorism and acts of war that generally are not insured. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We cannot assure you that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future. If any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew our insurance coverage in an adequate amount or at reasonable prices. Insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts and mold, or, if offered, these types of insurance may be prohibitively expensive. Moreover, we do not purchase life or disability insurance for any of our key employees. If any of our key employees were to die or become incapacitated, we could experience losses caused by a disruption in our operations which will not be covered by insurance, and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Demand for our premium properties which target the high-income demographic may be insufficient. We have focused on development projects intended to cater to affluent individuals and have entered into property swap agreements pursuant to which we contribute our undeveloped properties to ventures with developers who will deliver to us units in full-service apartments in premium locations of downtown Buenos 22 Table of Contents Aires, such as the Renoir towers. These developments are currently estimated to be completed in 2008 and will bring to the market over 11,500 square meters of high quality residential apartments. At the time the developers return these properties to us, demand for premium apartments could be significantly lower than we currently project. In such case, we would be unable to sell these apartments at the prices or in the time frame we estimated, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly and transfer restrictions apply to some of our properties. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and this tends to limit our ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, significant expenditures associated with each equity investment, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment. If income from a property declines while the related expenses do not decline, our business would be adversely affected. A significant portion of our properties are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, we could lose money as a result of foreclosure on the properties by the various mortgagees. In addition, if it becomes necessary or desirable for us to dispose of one or more of the mortgaged properties, we might not be able to obtain a release of the lien on the mortgaged property without payment of the associated debt. The foreclosure of a mortgage on a property or inability to sell a property could adversely affect our business. In transactions of this kind, we may also agree, subject to certain exceptions, not to sell the acquired properties for significant periods of time. Our level of debt may adversely affect our operations and our ability to pay our debt as it becomes due. We have had, and expect to continue to have, substantial liquidity and capital resource requirements to finance our business. As of June 30, 2007, our consolidated financial debt was Ps.1,414.5 million (including accrued and unpaid interest and deferred financing costs). The fact that we are leveraged may affect our ability to refinance existing debt or borrow additional funds to finance working capital, acquisitions and capital expenditures. This would require us to allocate a substantial portion of cash flow to repay principal and interest, thereby reducing the amount of money available to invest in operations, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Our leverage could place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less leveraged and limit our ability to react to changes in market conditions, changes in the real estate industry and economic downturns. Although we have successfully restructured our debt, we cannot assure you that we will not relapse and become unable to pay our obligations. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our debt service requirements or to obtain future financing. If we cannot satisfy our debt service requirements or if we default on any financial or other covenants in our debt arrangements, the holders of our debt will be able to accelerate the maturity of such debt or cause defaults under the other debt arrangements. Our ability to service debt obligations or to refinance them will depend upon our future financial and operating performance, which will, in part, be subject to factors beyond our control such as macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes in Argentina. If we cannot obtain future financing, we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our planned capital expenditures, which could adversely affect our ability to generate cash flows and repay our obligations. We are subject to risks inherent to the operation of shopping centers that may affect our profitability. Shopping centers are subject to various factors that affect their development, administration and profitability. These factors include: the accessibility and the attractiveness of the area where the shopping center is located; the intrinsic attractiveness of the shopping center; 23 Table of Contents the flow of people and the level of sales of each shopping center rental unit; increasing competition from internet sales; the amount of rent collected from each shopping center rental unit; and the fluctuations in occupancy levels in the shopping centers. An increase in operating costs, caused by inflation or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on us if our tenants are unable to pay higher rent due to the increase in expenses. Moreover, the shopping center business is closely related to consumer spending and to the economy in which customers are located. All of our shopping centers are in Argentina, and, as a consequence, their business could be seriously affected by potential recession in Argentina. For example, during the economic crisis in Argentina, spending decreased significantly, unemployment, political instability and inflation significantly reduced consumer spending in Argentina, lowering tenants sales and forcing some tenants to leave our shopping centers. If this were to occur again, it could have a material adverse effect on the revenues from the shopping center activity. The loss of significant tenants could adversely affect both the operating revenues and value of our shopping center and other rental properties. If certain of our most important tenants were to experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, insolvency or a general downturn of business, or if we simply failed to retain their patronage, our business could be adversely affected. Our shopping centers and, to a lesser extent, our office buildings are typically anchored by significant tenants, such as well known department stores who generate shopping traffic at the mall. A decision by such significant tenants to cease operations at our shopping centers or office buildings could have a material adverse effect on the revenues and profitability of the affected segment and, by extension, on our financial condition and results of operations. The closing of one or more significant tenants may induce other tenants at an affected property to terminate their leases, to seek rent relief and/or cease operating their stores or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the property. If we are not able to successfully lease the affected space again, the bankruptcy and/or closure of significant tenants, could have an adverse effect on both the operating revenues and underlying value of the properties involved. We are subject to payment default risks due to our investments in credit card businesses through our subsidiary Alto Palermo. Our subsidiary Alto Palermo owns an 80% interest in Tarshop S.A., or Tarshop, a credit card company that originates credit card accounts to promote sales from Alto Palermos tenants and other selected retailers. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, Tarshop had net revenues of Ps.213.0 million, representing 44.1% of Alto Palermos revenues and 28.8% of our consolidated revenues for such fiscal year. Credit card businesses such as Tarshop are adversely affected by defaults or late payments by card holders on credit card accounts, difficulties enforcing collection of payments, fraudulent accounts and the writing off of past due receivables. The present rates of delinquency, collection proceedings and loss of receivables may vary and be affected by numerous factors beyond our control, which, among others, include: adverse changes in the Argentine economy; adverse changes in the regional economies; political instability; increases in unemployment; and erosion of real and/or nominal salaries. 24 Table of Contents These and other factors may have an adverse effect on rates of delinquency, collections and receivables, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of Tarshops credit card business. In addition, if our credit card business is adversely affected by one or more of the above factors, the quality of our securitized receivables is also likely to be adversely affected. Therefore, we could be adversely affected to the extent that we hold an interest in any such securitized receivables. Our subordinated interest in Tarshops securitized assets may have no value. Tarshop S.A., an Alto Palermo subsidiary, is a credit card company that originates credit card accounts to promote sales from Alto Palermos tenants and other selected retailers. Tarshops accounts receivables, which consist of cash flows from consumer financing and personal loans, are placed into a number of trust accounts that securitize those receivables. Tarshop sells beneficial interests in these trust accounts through the sale of debt certificates, but remains a beneficiary of these trust accounts by holding Ps.77.8 million in debt certificates as of June 30, 2007. We cannot assure you that collection of payments from credit card accounts will be sufficient to distribute earnings to holders of participation certificates, which would reduce Tarshops earnings. In addition, local authorities might increase credit card or trust account regulations, negatively affecting Tarshops revenues and results of operation. We are subject to risks affecting the hotel industry. The full-service segment of the lodging industry in which our hotels operate is highly competitive. The operational success of our hotels is highly dependant on our ability to compete in areas such as access, location, quality of accommodations, rates, quality food and beverage facilities and other services and amenities. Our hotels may face additional competition if other companies decide to build new hotels or improve their existing hotels to increase their attractiveness. In addition, the profitability of our hotels depends on: our ability to form successful relationships with international and local operators to run our hotels; changes in tourism and travel patterns, including seasonal changes; and taxes and governmental regulations affecting wages, prices, interest rates, construction procedures and costs. Our business is subject to extensive regulation and additional regulations may be imposed in the future. Our activities are subject to federal, state and municipal laws, and to regulations, authorizations and licenses required with respect to construction, zoning, use of the soil, environmental protection and historical patrimony, consumer protection and other requirements, all of which affect our ability to acquire land, develop and build projects and negotiate with customers. In addition, companies in this industry are subject to increasing tax rates, the creation of new taxes and changes in the taxation regime. We are required to obtain licenses and authorizations with different governmental authorities in order to carry out our projects. Maintaining our licenses and authorizations can be a costly provision. In the case of non-compliance with such laws, regulations, licenses and authorizations, we may face fines, project shutdowns, cancellation of licenses and revocation of authorizations. In addition, public authorities may issue new and stricter standards, or enforce or interpret existing laws and regulations in a more restrictive manner, which may force us to make expenditures to comply with such new rules. Development activities are also subject to risks relating to potential delays or an inability to obtain all 25 Table of Contents necessary zoning, environmental, land-use, development, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. Any such delays or failures to obtain such government approvals may have an adverse effect on our business. In the past, the Argentine government imposed strict and burdensome regulations regarding leases in response to housing shortages, high rates of inflation and difficulties in accessing credit. Such regulations limited or prohibited increases on rental prices and prohibited eviction of tenants, even for failure to pay rent. Most of our leases provide that the tenants pay all costs and taxes related to their respective leased areas. In the event of a significant increase in the amount of such costs and taxes, the Argentine government may respond to political pressure to intervene by regulating this practice, thereby negatively affecting our rental income. We cannot assure you that the Argentine government will not impose similar or other regulations in the future. Changes in existing laws or the enactment of new laws governing the ownership, operation or leasing of properties in Argentina could negatively affect the Argentine real estate market and the rental market and materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability. Lease Law No. 23,091 imposes restrictions that limit our flexibility. Argentine laws governing leases impose certain restrictions, including the following: lease agreements may not contain inflation adjustment clauses based on consumer price indexes or wholesale price indexes. Although many of our lease agreements contain readjustment clauses, these are not based on an official index nor do they reflect the inflation index. In the event of litigation it may be impossible for us to adjust the amounts owed to us under our lease agreements; residential leases must comply with a mandatory minimum term of two years and retail leases must comply with a mandatory minimum term of three years except in the case of stands and/or spaces for special exhibitions; lease terms may not exceed ten years, except for leases regulated by Law No. 25,248 (which provides that leases containing a purchase option are not subject to term limitations); and tenants may rescind commercial lease agreements after the initial six-month period. As a result of the foregoing, we are exposed to the risk of increases of inflation under our leases and the exercise of rescission rights by our tenants could materially and adversely affect our business and we cannot assure you that our tenants will not exercise such right, especially if rent values stabilize or decline in the future. Eviction proceedings in Argentina are difficult and time consuming. Although Argentine law permits a summary proceeding to collect unpaid rent and a special proceeding to evict tenants, eviction proceedings in Argentina are difficult and time-consuming. Historically, the heavy workloads of the courts and the numerous procedural steps required have generally delayed landlords efforts to evict tenants. Eviction proceedings generally take between six months and two years from the date of filing of the suit to the time of actual eviction. Historically, delinquency regarding our office rental space has been very low, approximately 2%, and we have usually attempted to negotiate the termination of lease agreements with defaulting tenants after the first few months of non-payment in order to avoid legal proceedings. Delinquency may increase significantly in the future, and such negotiations with tenants may not be as successful as they have been in the past. Moreover, new 26 Table of Contents Argentine laws and regulations may forbid or restrict eviction proceedings, and in such case, they would likely have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. Our assets are concentrated in the Buenos Aires area. Our principal properties are located in the City of Buenos Aires and the Province of Buenos Aires and a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from such properties. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, more than 87% of our consolidated revenues were derived from properties in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area including the City of Buenos Aires. Although we own properties and may acquire or develop additional properties outside Buenos Aires, we expect to continue to depend to a large extent on economic conditions affecting those areas, and therefore, an economic downturn in those areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We face risks associated with potential expansion to other Latin American markets. From 1994 to 2002, we had substantial investments outside of Argentina, including Brazil Realty, which was sold in 2002, and Fondo de Valores Inmobiliarios in Venezuela, which was sold in 2001. We continue to believe that Brazil and other Latin American countries offer attractive opportunities for growth in the real estate sector. We will continue to consider investment opportunities outside of Argentina as they arise. Investments in Brazil and other Latin American countries are subject to significant risks including sovereign risks and risks affecting these countries real estate sectors. These risks include competition by well-established as well as new developers, unavailability of financing or financing on terms that are not acceptable to us, exchange rate fluctuations, lack of liquidity in the market, rising construction costs and inflation, extensive and potentially increasing regulation and bureaucratic procedures to obtain permits and authorizations, political and economic instability that may result in sharp shifts in demand for properties, risks of default in payment and difficulty evicting defaulting tenants. If the bankruptcy of Inversora Dársena Norte is extended to our subsidiary Puerto Retiro S.A., we will likely lose a significant investment in a unique waterfront land reserve in the City of Buenos Aires. On November 18, 1997, in connection with the acquisition of our subsidiary Inversora Bolívar S.A., or Inversora Bolívar, we indirectly acquired 35.2% of the capital stock of Puerto Retiro. Inversora Bolívar had purchased such shares of Puerto Retiro from Redona Investments Ltd. N.V. in 1996. In 1999, through Inversora Bolívar, we increased our interest in Puerto Retiro to 50.0% of its capital stock. On April 18, 2000, Puerto Retiro received notice of a complaint filed by the Argentine government, through the Ministry of Defense, seeking to extend the bankruptcy of Inversora Dársena Norte S.A. (Indarsa). Upon filing of the complaint, the bankruptcy court issued an order restraining the ability of Puerto Retiro to dispose of, in any manner, the real property it had purchased in 1993 from Tandanor S.A. (Tandanor). Puerto Retiro appealed the restraining order which was confirmed by the court on December 14, 2000. In 1991, Indarsa had purchased 90% of Tandanor, a formerly government owned company, which owned a large piece of land near Puerto Madero of approximately 8 hectares, divided into two spaces: Planta 1 and 2. After the purchase of Tandanor by Indarsa, in June 1993 Tandanor sold Planta 1 to Puerto Retiro, for a sum of US$18 million pursuant to a valuation performed by J.L. Ramos, a well-known real estate brokerage firm in Argentina. Indarsa failed to pay to the Argentine government the outstanding price for its purchase of the stock of Tandanor. As a result the Ministry of Defense requested the bankruptcy of Indarsa. Since the only asset of Indarsa was its holding in Tandanor, the Argentine government is seeking to extend the bankruptcy to the companies or individuals which, according to its view, acted as a single economic group. In particular, the Argentine government has requested the extension of the bankruptcy to Puerto Retiro which acquired Planta 1 from Tandanor. 27 Table of Contents The time for producing evidence in relation to these legal proceeding has expired. The parties have submitted their closing arguments and are awaiting a final judgment. However, the judge has delayed his decision until a final judgment in the criminal proceedings against the former Defense Minister and former directors of Indarsa has been delivered. We cannot give you any assurance that we will prevail in this proceeding, and if the plaintiffs claim is upheld by the courts, all of the assets of Puerto Retiro would likely be used to pay Indarsas debts and our investment in Puerto Retiro, valued at Ps.54.9 million, as of June 30, 2007. As of June 30, 2007, we had not established any reserve in respect of this contingency. Property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. We develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. For example, in the Shopping Center segment, we own 62.5% of Alto Palermo, while Parque Arauco S.A. owns 29.5%. In the Development and Sale segment, we have a majority ownership interests in various properties, including 100% ownership of Pereiraola S.A. and 100% of Caballito. We also have ownership of 50% in Puerto Retiro and Cyrsa. In the Hotel operations segment, we own 50% of the Llao Llao Hotel, while another 50% is owned by the Sutton Group. We own 80% of the Hotel Libertador, while 20% is owned by Hoteles Sheraton de Argentina S.A. In the financial services sector, we own 11.8% of Banco Hipotecario, while the Argentine government has a controlling interest in it. We could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. Moreover, our joint venture partners may, at any time, have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. For example, the approval of certain of the other investors is required with respect to operating budgets and refinancing, encumbering, expanding or selling any of these properties. In some instances, our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. If the objectives of our joint venture partners are inconsistent with our own objectives, we will not be able to act exclusively in our interests. If one or more of the investors in any of our jointly owned properties were to experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, insolvency or a general downturn of business, there could be an adverse effect on the relevant property or properties and in turn, on our financial performance. Should a joint venture partner be declared bankrupt, we could become liable for our partners share of joint venture liabilities. We may not be able to recover the mortgage loans we have provided to purchasers of units in our residential development properties. In recent years, we have provided mortgage financing to purchasers of units in our residential development properties. Before January 2002, our mortgage loans were U.S. dollar-denominated and accrued interest at a fixed interest rate generally ranging from 10% to 15% per year and for terms generally ranging from one to fifteen years. However, on March 13, 2002, the Central Bank converted all U.S. dollar denominated debts into Peso denominated debts at the exchange rate of Ps.1.00 = US$1.00. In addition, the Central Bank imposed maximum interest rates of 3% for residential mortgage loans to individuals and 6% for mortgage loans to businesses. These regulations adversely affected the U.S. dollar value of our outstanding mortgages. Beside risks normally associated with providing mortgage financing, including the risk of default on principal and interest, other regulatory risks such as suspension of foreclosure enforcement proceedings could adversely affect our cash flow. Argentine law imposes significant restrictions on our ability to foreclose and auction properties. Thus, when there is a default under a mortgage, we do not have the right to foreclose on the unit. Instead, in accordance with Law No. 24,441, in order to reacquire a property we are required to purchase it at a court ordered public auction, or at an out-of-court auction. However, the Public Emergency Law temporarily suspended all judicial and non-judicial mortgage and pledge enforcement actions. Several laws and decrees extended this mortgage foreclosure suspension period. On June 14, 2006, a new suspension period was approved, which established a 180-day suspension period for mortgage foreclosure proceedings affecting debtors only dwellings and where the original loan was no higher than Ps.100,000. 28 Table of Contents Law No. 25,798 enacted November 5, 2003, and implemented by Decrees No. 1284/2003 and No. 352/2004, among others, sets forth a system to restructure delinquent mortgage payments to prevent foreclosures on a debtors only dwelling (the Mortgage Refinancing System). The Mortgage Refinancing System establishes a trust over assets contributed by the Argentine government and income from restructured mortgage loans. Banco de la Nación Argentina, in its capacity as trustee of said trust, enters into debt restructuring agreements with delinquent mortgage debtors establishing the following terms: (i) a grace period on the mortgage loan of one year and (ii) monthly installment payments on the mortgage loan not to exceed 30% of the aggregate income of the family living in the mortgaged property. Banco de la Nación Argentina then subrogates the mortgagees rights against the debtor, by issuing notes delivered to the mortgagee to settle the amounts outstanding on the mortgage loan. The sum restructured under the Mortgage Refinancing System may not exceed the appraisal value of the property securing the mortgage after deducting any debts for taxes and maintenance. The Mortgage Refinancing System was established for a limited period of time, during which parties to a mortgage loan agreement could opt to participate in it. However, it was extended by a number of decrees and laws. Law No. 26,167, enacted in November, 2006 established a special proceeding to replace ordinary trials regarding the enforcement of mortgage loans. Such special proceedings give creditors ten days to inform the debtor of the amounts owed to them and later agree with the debtor on the amount and terms of payment. If the parties fail to reach an agreement, payment conditions are to be determined by the judge. We cannot assure you that laws and regulations relating to foreclosure on real estate will not continue to change in the future or that any changes will not adversely affect our business, financial condition or result of operations. We are dependent on our chairman Eduardo Elsztain and certain other senior managers. Our success depends on the continued employment of Eduardo S. Elsztain, our chief executive officer, president and chairman of the board of directors, who has significant expertise and knowledge of our business and industry. The loss of or interruption in his services for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success also depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel. A failure to hire or retain qualified personnel may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may face potential conflicts of interest relating to our principal shareholders. Our largest beneficial owner is Mr. Eduardo S. Elsztain, through his indirect shareholding through Cresud. As of November 30, 2007, such beneficial ownership consisted of: (i) 199,312,028 shares held by Cresud, (ii) 7,998,522 shares held by IFISA, (iii) 586,000 shares held by Consultores Venture Capital Limited, a stock corporation organized under the laws of Cayman Islands, (iv) 1,154,279 held by Dolphin Fund PLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Isle of Man and (v) 311,367 shares held directly by Mr. Elsztain. Conflicts of interest between our management, us and our affiliates may arise in the performance of our respective business activities. As of November 30, 2007, Mr. Elsztain also beneficially owned (i) approximately 31.8% of Cresuds common shares and (ii) approximately 62.5% of the common shares of our subsidiary Alto Palermo. Although Mr. Elsztain does not have a majority of our shares, he is our largest shareholder and exercises substantial influence over us. If Mr. Elsztain were considered the beneficial owner of IRSA due to his substantial influence over us, he would be the beneficial owner of 62.5% of our subsidiary Alto Palermo shares. We cannot assure you that our principal shareholders and their affiliates will not limit or cause us to forego business opportunities that their affiliates may pursue or that the pursuit of other opportunities will be in our interest. 29 Table of Contents Due to the currency mismatches between our assets and liabilities, we have significant currency exposure. As of June 30, 2007, the majority of our liabilities, such as our unsecured loan agreement, our Series 3 secured floating rate notes due 2009, our 8.5% notes due 2017, Alto Palermos Series I Notes, the mortgage loan to our subsidiary Hoteles Argentinos S.A., our 8% convertible notes and Alto Palermos convertible notes are denominated in U.S. dollars while our revenues and most of our assets as of June 30, 2007 are denominated in Pesos. This currency gap exposes us to a risk of exchange rate volatility, which would negatively affect our financial results if the dollar were to appreciate against the Peso. Any further depreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar will correspondingly increase the amount of our debt in Pesos, with further adverse effects on our results of operation and financial condition and may increase the collection risk of our leases and other receivables from our tenants and mortgage debtors, most of whom have Peso-denominated revenues. Risks Relating to our Investment in Banco Hipotecario Our investment in Banco Hipotecario is subject to risks affecting Argentinas financial system. As of June 30, 2007, IRSA owned 11.8% of Banco Hipotecario, which represented 7.3% of IRSAs consolidated assets at such date. Substantially all of Banco Hipotecarios operations, properties and customers are located in Argentina. Accordingly, the quality of its loan portfolio, its financial condition and results of operations depend to a significant extent on economic and political conditions prevailing in Argentina. The political and economic crisis in Argentina during 2002 and 2003 and the Argentine governments actions to address it have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on Banco Hipotecarios business, financial condition and results of operations. Financial institutions are subject to significant regulation relating to functions that historically have been mandated by the Central Bank and other regulatory authorities. Measures adopted by the Central Bank have had, and future regulations may have, a material adverse effect on Banco Hipotecarios financial condition and results of operations. On July 25, 2003, the Central Bank announced its intention to adopt new capital adequacy requirements that it will implement gradually through to 2009. In addition, the IMF and other multilateral agencies encouraged the Argentine government to impose minimum capital adequacy, solvency and liquidity requirements consistent with international standards, which could impose material operating restrictions on Banco Hipotecario. Laws and decrees implemented during the economic crisis in 2001 and 2002 have substantially altered contractual obligations affecting Argentinas financial sector. Recently, the Argentine Congress has considered various initiatives intended to reduce or eliminate a portion of the mortgage loan portfolio on the debt owed to Banco Hipotecario. Also, there have been certain initiatives intended to review the terms pursuant to which Banco Hipotecario was privatized. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Argentine legislature will not enact new laws that will have a significant adverse effect on Banco Hipotecarios shareholders equity or that the Argentine government would compensate Banco Hipotecario for the resulting loss. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment in Banco Hipotecario. Banco Hipotecario relies heavily on mortgage lending, and the value of our investment in it depends in part on its ability to implement successfully its new business diversification strategy. Historically, Banco Hipotecario has been engaged exclusively in mortgage lending and related activities. As a result, factors having an adverse effect on the mortgage market have a greater adverse impact on Banco Hipotecario than on its more diversified competitors. Due to its historic concentration in this recession-sensitive sector, Banco Hipotecario is particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic and market conditions in Argentina due to their adverse effect on (i) demand for new mortgage loans and (ii) the asset quality of outstanding mortgage loans. The last economic crisis had a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial 30 Table of Contents conditions and results of operations. In addition, a number of governmental measures that apply to the financial sector have had a material adverse effect particularly on Banco Hipotecario, impairing its financial condition. In light of the economic conditions in Argentina for the foreseeable future, Banco Hipotecario cannot rely exclusively on mortgage lending and related services. Accordingly, Banco Hipotecario has adapted its business strategy to confront the challenges of these new market conditions. Banco Hipotecarios ability to diversify its operation will depend on how successfully it diversifies its product offerings and transforms itself into a financial institution that no longer relies solely on mortgage lending. In the past years Banco Hipotecario has made several investments that are designed to enable it to develop retail banking activities. Banco Hipotecario must overcome significant challenges to achieve this goal including, among others, its lack of experience and client relationships outside the mortgage sector, the existence of large, well-positioned competitors and significant political, regulatory and economic uncertainties in Argentina. As a result, we cannot give you any assurance that Banco Hipotecario will be successful in developing significant retail banking activities in the foreseeable future, if at all. If Banco Hipotecario is unable to diversify its operations by developing its retail banking activities and other non-mortgage banking activities, the value of our substantial investment in Banco Hipotecario would likely be materially and adversely affected. Banco Hipotecarios mortgage loan portfolio is not adequately indexed for inflation and any significant increase in inflation could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. In accordance with Emergency Decree No. 214/02 and its implementing regulations, pesified assets and liabilities were adjusted for inflation as of February 3, 2002 by application of the Coeficiente de Estabilización de Referencia, or CER, a consumer price inflation coefficient. On May 6, 2002, the Executive Branch issued a decree providing that mortgages originally denominated in U.S. dollars and converted into Pesos pursuant to Decree No. 214/2002 and mortgages on property constituting a borrowers sole family residence may be adjusted for inflation only pursuant to a coefficient based on salary variation, the CVS, which during 2002 was significantly less than inflation as measured by the wholesale price index, or WPI. Through December 31, 2002, the WPI and the CVS posted cumulative increases of 118.2% and 0.2%, respectively, and the CER increased 41.4%. During 2003, inflation rose by 4.3% as measured by the WPI, 3.7% as measured by the CER and 15.8% as measured by the CVS. As a result, only 10% of Banco Hipotecarios mortgage loans are adjusted for inflation in accordance with the CER, 30% are adjusted in accordance with the CVS and 60% remain entirely unindexed. Additionally, pursuant to Law No. 25,796, Section 1, repealed effective April 1, 2004, the CVS as an indexation mechanism applied to the relevant portion of Banco Hipotecarios mortgages loans. The CVS increased until it was repealed by 5.3%, whereas the increase in CER was 5.5% as of December 31, 2004 and the WPI increased by 7.9%. During 2005 the CER was 11.75% and the WPI 10.7%, while in 2006 the CER and WPI increased by 10.3% and 7.1%, respectively. Argentinas history prior to the adoption of the Convertibility Law raises serious doubts as to the ability of the Argentine government to maintain a strict monetary policy and control inflation. As a result of the high inflation in Argentina from 2002 onwards, Banco Hipotecarios mortgage loan portfolio experienced a significant decrease in value and if inflation were to increase significantly once again, it might continue to undergo a major decrease in value. Accordingly, an increase in Banco Hipotecarios funding and other costs due to inflation might not be offset by indexation, which could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations. Legislation limiting Banco Hipotecarios ability to foreclose on mortgaged collateral may have an adverse effect on it. Like other mortgage lenders, the ability to foreclose on mortgaged collateral to recover on delinquent mortgage loans impacts the conduct of Banco Hipotecarios business. In February 2002, the Argentine government amended Argentinas Bankruptcy Law, suspending bankruptcies and foreclosures on real estate that constitutes the debtors primary residence, initially for a six-month period and subsequently extended until November 14, 2002. Since 2003, the Argentine government has approved various laws that have suspended, in some cases, foreclosures for a period of time in accordance with Law No. 25,972 enacted on December 18, 2004, 31 Table of Contents and, in some cases, temporarily suspended all judicial and non-judicial mortgage and pledge enforcement actions. Several laws and decrees extended this mortgage foreclosure suspension period. Most recently, on June 14, 2006, Argentine Law 26,103 was enacted which established a 180-day suspension period for mortgage foreclosure proceedings affecting debtors where the subject mortgage related to the debtors sole residence and where the original loan was not greater than Ps.100,000. Law No. 25,798, enacted November 5, 2003, and implemented by Decrees No. 1284/2003 and No. 352/2004, among others, sets forth a system to restructure delinquent mortgage payments to prevent foreclosures on a debtors sole residence (the Mortgage Refinancing System). The Mortgage Refinancing System establishes a trust composed of assets contributed by the Argentine government and income from restructured mortgage loans. Banco de la Nación Argentina, in its capacity as trustee of said trust, enters into debt restructuring agreements with delinquent mortgage debtors establishing the following terms: (i) a grace period on the mortgage loan of one year and (ii) monthly installment payments on the mortgage loan not to exceed 30% of the aggregate income of the family living in the mortgaged property. Banco de la Nación Argentina then subrogates the mortgagees rights against the debtor, by issuing notes delivered to the mortgagee to settle the amounts outstanding on the mortgage loan. The sum restructured under the Mortgage Refinancing System may not exceed the appraisal value of the property securing the mortgage after deducting any debts for taxes and maintenance. The Mortgage Refinancing System was established for a limited period of time, during which parties to mortgage loan agreements could opt to participate and was subsequently extended by a number of decrees and laws. Law No. 26,167 enacted on November 29, 2006, suspended foreclosures and also established a special proceeding for the enforcement of certain mortgage loans. Such special proceedings give creditors a 10-day period to inform the court of the amounts owed under the mortgage loan. Soon thereafter, the judge will call the parties for a hearing in order to reach an agreement on the amount and terms of payment thereunder. In case of failure by the parties to reach such agreement, they will have a 30-day negotiation period, and if the negotiations do not result in an agreement, then, payment and conditions will be determined by the courts. On November 29, 2006, Law No. 26,177 created the Unidad de Reestructuración, a government agency responsible for the revision of each of the mortgage loans granted by the state-owned Banco Hipotecario Nacional, the predecessor of Banco Hipotecario, before the enactment of the Convertibility Law in 1991. The Unidad de Reestructuración also makes non-binding recommendations to facilitate the restructuring of such mortgage loans. If no agreement is reached, the Unidad de Reestructuración will submit a proposal to the National Congress, which may recommend forgiveness or other write-off of such loans, extensions of their scheduled maturities or other subsidies that adversely affect Banco Hipotecarios ability to foreclose on such mortgage loans. Recently enacted Law No. 26,313 established mandatory restructuring of certain mortgage loans granted by the former Banco Hipotecario Nacional prior to April 1, 1991. The language of the law is to a certain degree unclear as concern its scope of application. Neither the Ministry of Economy nor the Central Bank have issued corresponding regulations explaining the application of the law as yet. Banco Hipotecarios management interpretation is that the law only applies to non-performing mortgage loans granted before April 1, 1991, which were already restructured according to former regulations. However, although we regard the following scenario as unlikely, if the regulations to be issued under the law were to interpret or provide that that the new recalculation is applicable to all mortgage loans granted prior to April 1, 1991, including performing loans, depending on the way in which such regulations were made, Banco Hipotecario S.A., as legal successor to the former Banco Hipotecario Nacional, might suffer a material financial loss to the extent that the law has not contemplated the payment of any damages or compensation to the Bank in such regard. We cannot assure you that the Argentine government will not enact further new laws restricting Banco Hipotecarios ability to enforce its rights as creditors. Any such limitation on its ability to successfully implement foreclosures could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. 32 Table of Contents Banco Hipotecarios non-mortgage loan portfolio has grown rapidly and is concentrated in the low- and middle-income segments. As a result of Banco Hipotecarios strategy to diversify its banking operations and develop retail and other non-mortgage banking activities, in recent years its portfolio of non-mortgage loans has grown rapidly. During the period between December 31, 2004 and June 30, 2007, Banco Hipotecarios portfolio of non-mortgage loans grew 799.3% from Ps.232.2 million to Ps.1,855.9 million. A very substantial portion of its portfolio of non-mortgage loans consists of loans to low- and middle-income individuals and, to a lesser extent, middle-market companies. These individuals and companies are likely to be more seriously affected by adverse developments in the Argentine economy than high income individuals and large corporations. Consequently, in the future Banco Hipotecario may experience higher levels of past due non-mortgage loans that would likely result in increased provisions for loan losses. In addition, large-scale lending to low- and middle-income individuals and middle-market companies is a new business activity for Banco Hipotecario, and as a result its experience and loan-loss data for such loans are necessarily limited. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the levels of past due non-mortgage loans and resulting charge-offs will not increase materially in the future. Given the current valuation criteria of the Central Bank for the recording of BODEN and other public securities on Banco Hipotecarios balance sheets, its most recent financial statements may not be indicative of its current financial condition. Banco Hipotecario prepares its financial statements in accordance with Central Bank accounting rules which differ in certain material respects from Argentine GAAP. During 2002, Central Bank accounting rules were modified in several respects that materially increased certain discrepancies between Central Bank accounting rules and Argentine GAAP. In accordance with Central Bank accounting rules, Banco Hipotecarios consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2007 includes US$816.6 million of BODEN issued by the Argentine government as compensation for pesification, as well as US$ 84.4 million representing its right to acquire additional BODEN. Banco Hipotecarios consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2007 also includes Ps.218.0 million representing Central Bank borrowings which Banco Hipotecario incurred to finance its acquisition of the additional BODEN. Also, since September 30, 2005 Banco Hipotecario has subscribed BODEN 2012 for US$773.5 million and reduced Central Bank borrowings for Ps.1,844.0 million. Additionally, its most recent consolidated annual income statements include the accrual of interest to be received on BODEN not yet received and interest to be paid adjusted by CER on Central Bank borrowings. In accordance with Central Bank accounting rules, the BODEN reflected on its consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2007 have been recorded at 100% of face value. However, the BODEN are unsecured debt obligations of the Argentine government, which has defaulted on a significant portion of its indebtedness although the government is current in respect of payments due on the BODEN and has restructured a substantial portion of its sovereign debt. As of June 30, 2007, the BODEN were not rated and were trading in the secondary market at a price of approximately US$97.20 for every US$100 of outstanding value. Carrying BODEN at a value equal to their full face value, which is in excess of their current market value, has the effect of increasing Banco Hipotecarios total assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. In this important respect, its most recent consolidated audited annual financial statements are not comparable to its historic financial statements and have been prepared according to accounting principles that differ materially from Argentine GAAP. Due to interest rate and currency mismatches of its assets and liabilities, Banco Hipotecario has significant currency exposure. As of June 30, 2007, Banco Hipotecarios foreign currency-denominated liabilities exceeded its foreign currency denominated assets by approximately US$118 million. Substantially all of Banco Hipotecarios foreign currency assets consist of dollar-denominated BODEN, but Banco Hipotecarios liabilities in foreign currencies are denominated in both U.S. Dollars and Euros. This currency gap exposes Banco Hipotecario to risk of exchange rate volatility which would negatively affect Banco Hipotecarios financial results if the U.S. Dollar were to depreciate against the Peso and/or the Euro. We cannot assure you that the U.S. Dollar will not appreciate against the Peso, or that we will not be adversely affected by Banco Hipotecarios exposure to risks of exchange rate fluctuations. 33 Table of Contents Because of its large holdings of BODEN and guaranteed government loans, Banco Hipotecario has significant exposure to the Argentine public sector. On December 23, 2001, the Argentine government declared the suspension of payments on most of its sovereign debt, which as of December 31, 2001, totaled approximately US$144.5 billion, a substantial portion of which was restructured by the issuance of new bonds in the middle of 2005. Additionally, the Argentine government has incurred, and is expected to continue to incur, significant new debt obligations, including the issuance of compensatory bonds to financial institutions. As of June 30, 2007 Banco Hipotecario had a total of US$901.1 million of BODEN issued by the Argentine Government. At that same date, Banco Hipotecario also had a total of approximately US$0.2 million of guaranteed government loans. Given Banco Hipotecarios BODEN holdings, Banco Hipotecario has a significant exposure to the Argentine governments solvency. Further, defaults by the Argentine government on its debt obligations, including the BODEN and other government securities (such as the guaranteed government loans) held by Banco Hipotecario, would materially and adversely affect its financial condition which would in turn affect our investment. Banco Hipotecario operates in a highly regulated environment, and its operations are subject to regulations adopted, and measures taken, by the Central Bank, the Comisión Nacional de Valores and other regulatory agencies. Financial institutions are subject to significant regulation relating to functions that historically have been mandated by the Central Bank and other regulatory authorities. Measures adopted by the Central Bank have had, and future regulations may have, a material adverse effect on Banco Hipotecarios financial condition and results of operations. For example, on July 25, 2003, the Central Bank announced its intention to adopt new capital adequacy requirements that it will implement gradually through to 2009. In addition, the IMF and other multilateral agencies encouraged the Argentine Government to impose minimum capital adequacy, solvency and liquidity requirements consistent with international standards, which could impose material operating restrictions on Banco Hipotecario. Similarly, the Comisión Nacional de Valores, which authorizes Banco Hipotecarios offerings of securities and regulates the public markets in Argentina, has the authority to impose sanctions on Banco Hipotecario and its board of directors for breaches of corporate governance. Under applicable law, the Comisión Nacional de Valores has the authority to impose penalties that range from minor regulatory enforcement sanctions to significant monetary fines, to disqualification of directors from performing board functions for a period of time, and (in an extreme case) prohibiting issuers from making public offerings, if they were to determine that there was wrongdoing or material violation of law. Although Banco Hipotecario is not currently party to any proceeding before the Comisión Nacional de Valores, we cannot assure you that the Comisión Nacional de Valores will not initiate new proceedings against Banco Hipotecario, its shareholder or directors or impose further sanctions. Commencing in early 2002, laws and decrees have been implemented that have substantially altered the prevailing legal regime and obligations established in contract. In the recent past, various initiatives have been presented to Congress intended to reduce or eliminate the debt owed to Banco Hipotecario on a portion of its mortgage loan portfolio and there were initiatives intended to review the terms pursuant to which Banco Hipotecario Nacional was privatized. As a result, we cannot assure you that the legislative branch will not enact new laws that will have a significant adverse impact on Banco Hipotecarios shareholders equity or that, if this were to occur, the Argentine government would compensate us for the resulting loss. The Argentine government may prevail in all matters to be decided at a Banco Hipotecarios general shareholders meeting. According to the Privatization Law and Banco Hipotecarios by-laws, holders of Class A and Class D Shares have special voting rights relating to certain corporate decisions. Whenever such special rights do not apply (with respect to the Class A Shares and the Class D Shares) and in all cases (with respect to the Class B 34 Table of Contents Shares and the Class C Shares), each share of common shares entitles the holder to one vote. Pursuant to Argentine regulations, Banco Hipotecario may not issue new shares with multiple votes. The holders of Class D Shares have the right to elect nine of Banco Hipotecarios board members and their respective alternates. In addition, for so long as Class A Shares represent more than 42.0% of Banco Hipotecarios capital, the Class D Shares shall be entitled to three votes per share, provided that holders of Class D Shares will be entitled to only one vote per share in the case of a vote on: a fundamental change in Banco Hipotecarios corporate purpose; a change in Banco Hipotecarios domicile outside of Argentina; dissolution prior to the expiration of Banco Hipotecarios corporate existence; a merger or spin-off after which Banco Hipotecario would not be the surviving corporation; a total or partial recapitalization following a mandatory reduction of capital; and approval of voluntary reserves, other than legally mandated reserves, when their amount exceeds Banco Hipotecarios capital stock and its legally mandated reserves. In addition, irrespective of what percentage of Banco Hipotecarios outstanding capital stock is represented by Class A Shares, the affirmative vote of the holders of Class A Shares is required to adopt certain decisions. Class D Shares will not be converted into Class A Shares, Class B Shares or Class C Shares by virtue of their reacquisition by the Argentine government, PPP or Programa de Propiedad Participada (the Shared Property Program) participants or companies engaged in housing development or real estate activities. According to the Privatization Law, there are no restrictions on the ability of the Argentine government to dispose of its Class A shares, and all but one of such shares could be sold to third parties in a public offering. If the Class A shares represent less than 42% of Banco Hipotecarios total voting stock as a result of the issuance of new shares other than Class A shares, or otherwise the Class D shares IRSA holds will automatically lose their triple voting rights. If this were to occur, we would likely lose ours current ability, together with our affiliates that also hold Class D shares of Banco Hipotecario, to exercise substantial influence over decisions submitted to the vote of Banco Hipotecarios shareholders. Banco Hipotecario will continue to consider acquisition opportunities which may not be successful. From time to time in recent years, Banco Hipotecario has considered certain possible acquisitions or business combinations, and Banco Hipotecario expects to continue considering acquisitions that it believe offer attractive opportunities and are consistent with its business strategy. We cannot assure you, however, that Banco Hipotecario will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or that Banco Hipotecario will be able to acquire promising target financial institutions on favorable terms. Additionally, its ability to obtain the desired effects of such acquisitions will depend in part on its ability to successfully complete the integration of those businesses. The integration of acquired businesses entails significant risks, including: unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems; problems assimilating or retaining the employees of acquired businesses; challenges retaining customers of acquired businesses; 35 Table of Contents unexpected liabilities or contingencies relating to the acquired businesses; and the possibility that management may be distracted from day-to-day business concerns by integration activities and related problem solving. Risks Related to the Global Depositary Shares and the Shares Shares eligible for sale could adversely affect the price of our common shares and Global Depositary Shares. The market prices of our common shares and GDS could decline as a result of sales by our existing shareholders of common shares or GDSs in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. The GDSs are freely transferable under US securities laws, including shares sold to our affiliates. Cresud, which as of November 30, 2007, owned approximately 34.4% of our common shares (or approximately 199,312,028 common shares which may be exchanged for an aggregate of 19,931,202 GDSs), is free to dispose of any or all of its common shares or GDSs at any time in its discretion. Sales of a large number of our common shares and/or GDSs would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and the GDS. We are subject to certain different corporate disclosure requirements and accounting standards than domestic issuers of listed securities in the United States. There is less publicly available information about the issuers of securities listed on the Bolsa de Comercio de Buenos Aires than information publicly available about domestic issuers of listed securities in the United States and certain other countries. In addition, all listed Argentine companies must prepare their financial statements in accordance with Argentine GAAP and the regulations of the Comisión Nacional de Valores which differ in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP. For this and other reasons, the presentation of Argentine financial statements and reported earnings may differ from that of companies in other countries in this and other respects. We are exempted from the rules under the Exchange Act prescribing the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempted from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Investors may not be able to effect service of process within the U.S. limiting their recovery of any foreign judgment. We are a publicly held corporation (sociedad anónima) organized under the laws of Argentina. Most of our directors and our senior managers, and most of our assets are located in Argentina. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such persons or to enforce against us or them, in United States courts, judgments obtained in such courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws. We have been advised by our Argentine counsel, Zang, Bergel & Viñes, that there is doubt as to whether the Argentine courts will enforce to the same extent and in as timely a manner as a US or foreign court, an action predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws or other foreign regulations brought against such persons or against us. 36 Table of Contents If we are considered to be a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes, U.S. holders of our equity securities would suffer negative consequences. Based on the current and projected composition of our income and the valuation of our assets, including goodwill, we do not believe we were a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for United States federal income tax purposes for the taxable year ending June 30, 2007, and we do not currently expect to become a PFIC, although there can be no assurance in this regard. The determination of whether we are a PFIC is made annually. Accordingly, it is possible that we may be a PFIC in the current or any future taxable year due to changes in our asset or income composition or if our projections are not accurate. The volatility and instability of Argentinas economic and financial system may substantially affect the composition of our income and assets and the accuracy of our projections. If we become a PFIC, U.S. holders of our equity securities will be subject to certain United States federal income tax rules that have negative consequences for U.S. holders such as additional tax and an interest charge upon certain distributions by us or upon a sale or other disposition of our equity securities at a gain, as well as additional reporting requirements. See Taxation  Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences  Passive Foreign Investment Company for a more detailed discussion of the consequences if we are deemed a PFIC. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to your particular circumstances. Under Argentine law, shareholder rights may be fewer or less well defined than in other jurisdictions. Our corporate affairs are governed by our by-laws and by Argentine corporate law, which differ from the legal principles that would apply if we were incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States, such as the States of Delaware or New York, or in other jurisdictions outside Argentina. In addition, your rights or the rights of holders of our common shares to protect your or their interests in connection with actions by our board of directors may be fewer and less well defined under Argentine corporate law than under the laws of those other jurisdictions. Although insider trading and price manipulation are illegal under Argentine law, the Argentine securities markets are not as highly regulated or supervised as the US securities markets or markets in some other jurisdictions. In addition, rules and policies against selfdealing and regarding the preservation of shareholder interests may be less well defined and enforced in Argentina than in the United States, putting holders of our common shares and GDSs at a potential disadvantage. The protections afforded to minority shareholders in Argentina are different from and more limited than those in the United States and may be more difficult to enforce. Under Argentine law, the protections afforded to minority shareholders are different from, and much more limited than, those in the United States and some other Latin American countries. For example, the legal framework with respect to shareholder disputes, such as derivative lawsuits and class actions, is less developed under Argentine law than under U.S. law as a result of Argentinas short history with these types of claims and few successful cases. In addition, there are different procedural requirements for bringing these types of shareholder lawsuits. As a result, it may be more difficult for our minority shareholders to enforce their rights against us or our directors or controlling shareholder than it would be for shareholders of a US company. Holders of common shares may determine to not pay any dividends. In accordance with Argentine corporate law we may pay dividends to shareholders out of net and realized profits, if any, as set forth in our audited financial statements prepared in accordance with Argentine GAAP. The approval, amount and payment of dividends are subject to the approval by our shareholders at our annual ordinary shareholders meeting. The approval of dividends requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate enough net and realized profits so as to pay dividends or that our shareholders will decide that dividends will be paid. 37 Table of Contents Our ability to pay dividends is limited by law, by our by-laws and by certain restrictive covenants in our debt instruments. In accordance with Argentine corporate law, we may pay dividends in Pesos only out of retained earnings, if any, to the extent set forth in our audited financial statements prepared in accordance with Argentine GAAP. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common shares is limited by certain restrictive covenants in our debt instruments. On February 2, 2007, we issued our 8.5% notes due 2017 in an aggregate principal amount of US$150.0 million. These bonds contain a covenant limiting our ability to pay dividends which may not exceed the sum of: 50% of our cumulative consolidated net income; or 75% of our cumulative consolidated net income if our consolidated interest coverage ratio for our most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters is at least 3.0 to 1; or 100% of cumulative consolidated net income if our consolidated interest coverage ratio for our most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters is at least 4.0 to 1; or 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds (with certain exceptions) and the fair market value of property other than cash received by us or by our restricted subsidiaries from (a) any contribution to our equity capital or to the capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries or issuance and sale of our qualified capital stock or the qualified capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries subsequent to the issue of our notes due 2017, or (b) any issuance and sale subsequent to the issuance of our notes due 2017, of our indebtedness, or of the indebtedness of our restricted subsidiaries that has been converted into or exchanged for our qualified capital stock. As a result, we cannot give you any assurance that in the future we will pay any dividends in respect of our common shares.
