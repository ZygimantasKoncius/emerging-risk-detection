ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The Corporation's business is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Although the Corporation seeks ways to manage these risks and develop programs to control those that management can, the Corporation ultimately cannot predict the extent to which these risks and uncertainties could affect results. Actual results may differ materially from management's expectations. Some of the significant risks and uncertainties are discussed below. Changes in economic conditions or interest rates. The results of operations for financial institutions, including the Corporation, may be materially and adversely affected by changes in prevailing local and national economic conditions, including declines in real estate market values, rapid increases or decreases in interest rates and changes in the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. The national and global economic and credit markets continue to experience high levels of volatility and disruption which are particularly acute in the financial sector and may depress overall the market value of financial institutions, limit access to capital, or have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of banking companies in general, including the Corporation. Although the Corporation remains well capitalized, the possible duration and severity of the adverse economic cycle is unknown and may increase the Corporation's exposure to these risks. Federal le gislation has been passed and U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve Bank and FDIC programs are underway to address economic stabilization, yet the effectiveness of these programs in stabilizing the economy and the banking system at large is uncertain. The Corporation's profitability is heavily influenced by the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Substantially all of the Bank's loans are to businesses and individuals in the southern tier of New York and northern tier of Pennsylvania, and any decline in the economy of this area could adversely affect results. Like most financial institutions, the Corporation's net interest spread and margin will be affected by general economic conditions and other factors that influence market interest rates and the ability to respond to changes in such rates. At any given time, assets and liabilities may be such that they are affected differently by a given change in interest rates. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7, "Interest Rate Risk." Credit Risk. A significant source of risk for the Bank arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. Loans originated by the Bank can be either secured or unsecured depending on the nature of the loan. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans includes a wide variety of real and personal property that may be insufficient to cover the obligations owed under such loans. Collateral values may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, wide-spread disease, terrorist activity, environmental contamination and other external events. In addition, collateral appraisals that are out of date or that do not meet industry recognized standards may create the impression that a loan is adequately collateralized when in fact it is not. The Bank has adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and policies, including the establishment and review of the allowance for loan losses and regular review of appraisals and borrower financial statements, that management believes are appropriate to mitigate the risk of loss by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance and the value of available collateral, monitoring loan performance and diversifying the Bank's credit portfolio. Such policies and procedures, however, may not prevent unexpected losses that could have =========================================================11=============================================== a material adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. For further information regarding asset quality, see Part II, Item 7, "Management of Credit Risk-Loan Portfolio" and "Asset Quality." Litigation risk. Neither the Corporation nor its subsidiaries are a party to any material pending legal proceedings. If in the future any legal action is determined adversely to the Corporation, or if any legal action resulted in the Corporation paying a substantial settlement, then such adverse determination or settlement may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition. Difficulties in managing our growth. As part of the Corporation's strategy for continued growth, we may open additional branches. New branches do not initially contribute to operating profits due to the impact of overhead expenses and the start-up phase of generating loans and deposits. To the extent that additional branches are opened, the Corporation may experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations, which may have an adverse affect on the Corporation's levels of net income, return on average equity and return on average assets. In addition, the Corporation may acquire banks and related businesses that it believes provide a strategic fit with its business such as the recently announced pending acquisition of Canton Bancorp. Inc. To the extent that the Corporation grows through acquisitions, it cannot provide assurance that such strategic decisions will be accretive to earnings. Competition. The Corporation faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations from a variety of different competitors. Future growth and success will depend on the ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment. The Corporation competes for deposits, loans and other financial services with a variety of banks, thrifts, credit unions and other financial institutions as well as other entities which provide financial services. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as the Corporation. Many competitors have been in business for many years, have established customer bases, are larger, and have substantially higher lending limits. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institution s and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. For further information, see Part II, Item 7, "Competition." Government regulation. The financial services industry is heavily regulated under both federal and state law. These regulations are primarily intended to protect customers, not creditors or shareholders. As a financial holding company, the Corporation is also subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Reserve, in addition to other regulatory organizations. The ability to establish new facilities or make acquisitions is conditioned upon the receipt of the required regulatory approvals from these organizations. Regulations affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change, and the Corporation cannot predict the ultimate effect of such changes, which could have a material adverse effect on profitability or financial condition. For further information, see Part I, Item 1, "Supervision and Regulation." Technological change and breach of information security. The banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The Corporation's future success will depend, in part, on the ability to address the needs of customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to customers. Despite instituted safeguards, the Corporation cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures. The Corporation relies on the services of a variety of vendors to meet its data processing and communication needs. If information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and the Corporation could be exposed to claims from customers. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition, ======================================================12================================================== results of operations or liquidity.
