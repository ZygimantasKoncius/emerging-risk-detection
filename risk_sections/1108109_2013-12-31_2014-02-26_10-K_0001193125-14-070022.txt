Item 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements we make about our business. Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness. 23 Table of Contents We are significantly leveraged. Our wholly-owned subsidiary CHS/Community Health Systems, Inc., or CHS, has obtained senior secured financing under a credit facility, or Credit Facility, with a syndicate of financial institutions led by Credit Suisse, as administrative agent and collateral agent. The discussion and the table below describe our level of indebtedness and other information as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, a $750 million revolving credit facility was available to us for working capital and general corporate purposes under the Credit Facility, with $19.4 million of the revolving credit facility being set aside for outstanding letters of credit. On November 5, 2010, we entered into an amendment and restatement of our existing Credit Facility, which extended by two and a half years, until January 25, 2017 (subject to customary acceleration events), the maturity date of $1.5 billion of our existing term loans under the Credit Facility. In addition, effective February 2, 2012, we completed an additional amendment and restatement of the Credit Facility, which extended by two and a half years the maturity date of an additional $1.6 billion of our term loans due 2014 under the Credit Facility, until January 25, 2017 (subject to customary acceleration events). On March 6, 2012, we obtained a new $750 million incremental term loan A facility, or the Incremental Term Loan, with a maturity date of October 25, 2016, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan were used to prepay the same amount of the existing term loans due July 25, 2017 under the Credit Facility. On August 22, 2012, we entered into a loan modification agreement with respect to the Credit Facility to extend approximately $340 million of the term loans due 2014 to match the maturity date and interest rate margins of the term loans due January 25, 2017. The proceeds from the issuance of the 5 1⁄8% Senior Secured Notes discussed below were used to prepay $1.6 billion of the term loans due 2014. On August 12, 2013, CHS entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Facility to provide increased flexibility for CHS to incur debt by amending certain terms of the Credit Facility, including the maximum leverage ratio and secured leverage ratio covenant levels. In addition, the amendment includes pricing protection for certain term loans due January 25, 2017, which specifies an increased margin in certain instances. The amendment also provides for a total leverage-based step-up to the applicable margin of the term loans due January 25, 2017 and the term loans due July 25, 2014. The pricing of the loans under the Credit Facility will otherwise remain unchanged. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we paid down $206.5 million of the term loans due 2014. The remaining balance of the non-extended term loans due 2014 at December 31, 2013 of approximately $59.6 million was paid as part of the financing for the HMA merger. On November 22, 2011, CHS completed its offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 8% Senior Notes due 2019, or the 8% Senior Notes, which were issued in a private placement. The net proceeds from this issuance, together with available cash on hand, were used to finance the purchase of up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of CHS then outstanding 8 7⁄8% Senior Notes and related fees and expenses. The 8% Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations of CHS and are guaranteed on a senior basis by us and by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. On March 21, 2012, CHS completed its offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of additional 8% Senior Notes. The net proceeds from this issuance, together with available cash on hand, were used to finance the purchase of approximately $850 million aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding 8 7⁄8% Senior Notes, to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. On July 18, 2012, CHS completed its offering of $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 7 1⁄8% Senior Notes due 2020, or the 7 1⁄8% Senior Notes. A portion of the net proceeds from this issuance were used to purchase approximately $639.7 million principal amount (out of the then approximately $934.3 million total aggregate principal amount outstanding) of 8 7⁄8% Senior Notes that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the cash tender commenced on July 3, 2012, to pay for consents delivered in connection therewith and to pay related fees and expenses. On August 17, 2012, pursuant to our redemption option, we redeemed the remaining $294.6 million principal outstanding of the 8 7⁄8% Senior Notes. The 8% Senior Notes and the 7 1⁄8% Senior Notes are its unsecured senior obligations and are guaranteed on a senior basis by us and by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. On August 17, 2012, CHS completed its offering of $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of 5 1⁄8% Senior Secured Notes due 2018, or the 5 1⁄8% Senior Secured Notes. The net proceeds from this issuance, together with available cash on hand, were used to finance the prepayment of $1.6 billion of the then outstanding term loans due 2014 under the Credit Facility and related fees and expenses. On March 21, 2012, we entered into an accounts receivable loan agreement, or the Receivables Facility, with a group of lenders and banks with a maximum borrowing capacity of $300 million, as amended on March 7, 2013 to $500 million, and with an expiration date of March 21, 2015. The existing and future patient-related accounts receivable for certain of the Companys hospitals serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings under the Receivables Facility. The outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2013, pursuant to the Receivables Facility totaled $500.0 million. With the exception of some small principal payments of our term loans under our Credit Facility, approximately $59.6 million of term loans under our Credit Facility mature in 2014, the remaining $3.352 billion in term loans mature in 2017, our 5 1⁄8% Senior Secured Notes are due in 2018, our 8% Senior Notes are due in 2019 and our 7 1⁄8% Senior Notes are due 2020. The remaining $637.5 million in term loans under the incremental term loan A facility mature in 2016 and require quarterly amortization payments of 2.5% per quarter during 2013 and 2014, 3.75% per quarter during 2015 and 15% per quarter during 2016 through the maturity date, in each case, subject to customary adjustments for prepayments, with the balance payable in full on the maturity date. 24 Table of Contents December 31, 2013 ($ in millions) Senior secured credit facility term loans $ 4,050.1 8% Senior Notes 2,020.3 7 1⁄8% Senior Notes 1,200.0 5 1⁄8% Senior Secured Notes 1,600.0 Receivables Facility 500.0 Other 83.0 Total debt $ 9,453.4 Community Health Systems, Inc. stockholders equity $ 3,067.8 As of December 31, 2013, our approximately $2.0 billion notional amount of interest rate swap agreements outstanding represented approximately 44% of our variable rate debt. On a prospective basis, a 1% change in interest rates on the remaining unhedged variable rate debt existing as of December 31, 2013, would result in interest expense fluctuating approximately $25.5 million per year. The Credit Facility and/or the 8% Senior Notes, the 7 1⁄8% Senior Notes and the 5 1⁄8% Senior Secured Notes, or collectively known as the Notes, contain various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to:  incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness,  issue redeemable stock and preferred stock,  repurchase capital stock,  make restricted payments, including paying dividends and making investments,  redeem debt that is junior in right of payment to the Notes,  create liens,  sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries,  enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries,  merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of substantial portions of our assets,  enter into transactions with affiliates and  guarantee certain obligations. In addition, our Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants and requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants and financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests. The counterparty to the interest rate swap agreements exposes us to credit risk in the event of non-performance. However, at December 31, 2013, we do not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty due to the net settlement feature of the agreements and our net liability position with respect to most of our counterparties. 25 Table of Contents A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Credit Facility and/or the Notes. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our Credit Facility or the Notes, all amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility and the Notes may become immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Credit Facility to extend further credit may be terminated. Our leverage could have important consequences for you, including the following:  it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes,  a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities,  the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations,  some of our borrowings, including borrowings under our Credit Facility, are at variable rates of interest, exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates,  it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and  we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is a measure of our ability to meet our fixed obligations related to our indebtedness. The following table shows the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges (1) 1.60 x 1.69 x 1.61 x 1.66 x 1.45 x (1) Fixed charges include interest expensed and capitalized during the year plus an estimate of the interest component of rent expense. There are no shares of preferred stock outstanding. See exhibit 12 filed as part of this Report for the calculation of this ratio. Despite current indebtedness levels, we may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks described above. We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the indentures governing the Notes do not fully prohibit us from doing so. For example, under the indentures for the 8% Senior Notes, the 7 1⁄8% Senior Notes and the 5 1⁄8% Senior Secured Notes, as of December 31, 2013, we may incur up to approximately $4.8 billion pursuant to a credit facility and $500 million for a qualified receivables transaction, less certain amounts repaid with the proceeds of asset dispositions. As of December 31, 2013, our Credit Facility and Receivables Facility provided for commitments of up to approximately $5.3 billion in the aggregate. Additionally, as of December 31, 2013, our Credit Facility also gave us the ability to provide for one or more additional tranches of term loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion without the consent of the existing lenders if specified criteria are satisfied. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could be further exacerbated. Failure to achieve expected benefits of the HMA merger and to integrate HMAs operations with ours could adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock. Although we expect to realize strategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of the HMA merger, we cannot be certain whether, and to what extent, such benefits will be achieved in the future. In particular, the success of the merger will depend on achieving efficiencies and cost savings, and no assurances can be given that we will be able to do so. For example, costs associated with HMAs legal proceedings and other loss contingencies may be greater than expected, and could exceed the amount of any reduction in payment under the CVRs issued in the HMA merger to HMA stockholders. In addition, in order to obtain the benefits of the merger, we must integrate HMAs operations. Such integration may be complex and the failure to do so quickly and effectively may negatively affect earnings. 26 Table of Contents In addition, the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the merger if our integration of HMA is unsuccessful, takes longer than expected or fails to achieve financial benefits to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors, or the effect of the merger on our financial results is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors. HMA is the subject of legal proceedings that, if resolved unfavorably, could have an adverse effect on us, and HMA may be subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown. HMA is a party to various ongoing government investigations, legal proceedings and other related matters. Those proceedings include, among other things, government investigations. In addition, HMA is and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of HMAs legal proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against HMA in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity following the merger and our ability to achieve expected benefits of the merger. In particular, government investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits, may lead to material fines, penalties, damages payments or other sanctions, including exclusion from government healthcare programs. The costs relating to these matters could exceed the amount of any reduction in payment under the CVRs. Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements, each of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. We incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the HMA merger. In connection with the HMA merger, we entered into financing arrangements. We used this financing to pay, in part, the cash portion of the merger consideration and a portion of the fees and expenses related to the merger, which included the repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness of HMA. This additional indebtedness of ours may limit our operating flexibility and may otherwise strain our liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the HMA merger, our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and other intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheet increased. If our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we would be required to record a material, non-cash charge to earnings, which would also reduce our stockholders equity. Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis (or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable) and other intangible assets if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we will be required to record a material, non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined. We are required to file 2013 audited financial statements for HMA with the SEC. The audited financial statements of HMA as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, are required to be filed by us with the SEC within 71 days after the acquisition was required to be reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K. If we are unable to complete and file the audited financial statements within the required timeframe we could be out of compliance with the SECs timely filer status, potentially limiting our ability to file future registration statements or make public offerings of debt or equity securities. If competition decreases our ability to acquire additional hospitals on favorable terms, we may be unable to execute our acquisition strategy. An important part of our business strategy is to acquire two to four hospitals each year. However, not-for-profit hospital systems and other for-profit hospital companies generally attempt to acquire the same type of hospital as we do. Some of these other purchasers have greater financial resources than us. Our principal competitors for acquisitions have included HMA and LifePoint Hospitals, Inc. On some occasions, we also compete with HCA Holdings, Inc., Universal Health Services, Inc., other non-public, for-profit hospitals and local market hospitals. In addition, some hospitals are sold through an auction process, which may result in higher purchase prices than we believe are reasonable. Therefore, we may not be able to acquire additional hospitals on terms favorable to us. 27 Table of Contents If we fail to improve the operations of acquired hospitals, we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy. Many of the hospitals we have acquired had, or future acquisitions may have, significantly lower operating margins than we do and/or operating losses prior to the time we acquired or will acquire them. In the past, we have occasionally experienced temporary delays in improving the operating margins or effectively integrating the operations of these acquired hospitals. In the future, if we are unable to improve the operating margins of acquired hospitals, operate them profitably, or effectively integrate their operations, we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy. If we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations. Hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations. Although we generally seek indemnification from prospective sellers covering these matters, we may nevertheless have material liabilities for past activities of acquired hospitals. State efforts to regulate the construction, acquisition or expansion of hospitals could prevent us from acquiring additional hospitals, renovating our facilities or expanding the breadth of services we offer. Some states require prior approval for the construction or acquisition of healthcare facilities and for the expansion of healthcare facilities and services. In giving approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. In some states in which we operate, we are required to obtain CONs for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, changes in bed capacity or services and some other matters. Other states may adopt similar legislation. We may not be able to obtain the required CONs or other prior approvals for additional or expanded facilities in the future. In addition, at the time we acquire a hospital, we may agree to replace or expand the facility we are acquiring. If we are not able to obtain required prior approvals, we would not be able to replace or expand the facility and expand the breadth of services we offer. Furthermore, if a CON or other prior approval, upon which we relied to invest in construction of a replacement or expanded facility, were to be revoked or lost through an appeal process, then we may not be able to recover the value of our investment. State efforts to regulate the sale of hospitals operated by not-for-profit entities could prevent us from acquiring additional hospitals and executing our business strategy. Many states, including some where we have hospitals and others where we may in the future acquire hospitals, have adopted legislation regarding the sale or other disposition of hospitals operated by not-for-profit entities. In other states that do not have specific legislation, the attorneys general have demonstrated an interest in these transactions under their general obligations to protect the use of charitable assets. These legislative and administrative efforts focus primarily on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the non-profit seller. While these review and, in some instances, approval processes can add additional time to the closing of a hospital acquisition, we have not had any significant difficulties or delays in completing acquisitions. However, future actions on the state level could seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals. If we are unable to effectively compete for patients, local residents could use other hospitals. The hospital industry is highly competitive. In addition to the competition we face for acquisitions and physicians, we must also compete with other hospitals and healthcare providers for patients. The competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years. The majority of our hospitals are located in non-urban service areas. In nearly 60% of our markets, we are the sole provider of general acute care health services. In most of our other markets, the primary competitor is a not-for-profit hospital. These not-for-profit hospitals generally differ in each jurisdiction. However, our hospitals face competition from hospitals outside of their primary service area, including hospitals in urban areas that provide more complex services. Patients in our primary service areas may travel to these other hospitals for a variety of reasons. These reasons include physician referrals or the need for services we do not offer. Patients who seek services from these other hospitals may subsequently shift their preferences to those hospitals for the services we provide. Some of our hospitals operate in primary service areas where they compete with one other hospital; 33 of our hospitals competed with more than one other hospital in their respective primary service areas as of December 31, 2013. Some of these competing hospitals use equipment and services more specialized than those available at our hospitals. In addition, some competing hospitals are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions. These hospitals do not pay income or property taxes, and can make capital expenditures without paying sales tax. We also face competition from other specialized care providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers. 28 Table of Contents We expect that these competitive trends will continue. Our inability to compete effectively with other hospitals and other healthcare providers could cause local residents to use other hospitals. The failure to obtain our medical supplies at favorable prices could cause our operating results to decline. We have a participation agreement with HealthTrust, a GPO. This agreement extends to January 2015, with automatic renewal terms of one year, unless either party terminates by giving notice of non-renewal. GPOs attempt to obtain favorable pricing on medical supplies with manufacturers and vendors who sometimes negotiate exclusive supply arrangements in exchange for the discounts they give. To the extent these exclusive supply arrangements are challenged or deemed unenforceable, we could incur higher costs for our medical supplies obtained through HealthTrust. These higher costs could cause our operating results to decline. There can be no assurance that our arrangement with HealthTrust will provide the discounts we expect to achieve. If the fair value of our reporting units declines, a material non-cash charge to earnings from impairment of our goodwill could result. At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $4.4 billion of goodwill recorded on our books. We expect to recover the carrying value of this goodwill through our future cash flows. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate, based on the fair value of our reporting units, whether the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired. If the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired, we may incur a material non-cash charge to earnings. A significant decline in operating results or other indicators of impairment at one or more of our facilities could result in a material, non-cash charge to earnings to impair the value of long-lived assets. Our operations are capital intensive and require significant investment in long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and other long-lived intangible assets, including capitalized internal-use software. If one of our facilities experiences declining operating results or is adversely impacted by one or more of these risk factors, we may not be able to recover the carrying value of those assets through our future operating cash flows. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate whether changes in future undiscounted cash flows reflect an impairment in the fair value of our long-lived assets. If the carrying value of those assets is impaired, we may incur a material non-cash charge to earnings. Risks related to our industry We are subject to uncertainties regarding healthcare reform. In recent years, Congress and some state legislatures have introduced an increasing number of proposals to make major changes in the healthcare system, including an increased emphasis on the linkage between quality of care criteria and payment levels such as the submission of patient quality data to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. In addition, CMS conducts ongoing reviews of certain state reimbursement programs. ARRA was signed into law on February 17, 2009, providing for a temporary increase in the federal matching assistance percentage (FMAP), a temporary increase in federal Medicaid DSH allotments, subsidization of health insurance premiums (COBRA) for up to nine months and grants and loans for infrastructure and incentive payments for providers who adopt and use health information technology. This act also provides penalties by reducing reimbursement from Medicare in the form of reductions to scheduled market basket increases beginning in federal fiscal year 2015 if eligible hospitals and professionals fail to demonstrate meaningful use of electronic health record technology. 29 Table of Contents The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, was signed into law on March 23, 2010. In addition, the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, or Reconciliation Act, which contains a number of amendments to PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010. These two healthcare acts, referred to collectively as the Reform Legislation, include a mandate that requires substantially all U.S. citizens to maintain medical insurance coverage, which will ultimately increase the number of persons with access to health insurance in the United States. The Reform Legislation, as originally enacted, is expected to expand health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. We believe the expansion of private sector and Medicaid coverage will, over time, increase our reimbursement related to providing services to individuals who were previously uninsured, which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable. The Reform Legislation also makes a number of other changes to Medicare and Medicaid, such as reductions to the Medicare annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the Medicare market basket update which began October 1, 2011, and a reduction to the Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share payments, that could adversely impact the reimbursement received under these programs. The various provisions in the Reform Legislation that directly or indirectly affect reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years. Over time, we believe the net impact of the overall changes as a result of the Reform Legislation will have a positive effect on our net operating revenues. Other provisions of the Reform Legislation, such as requirements related to employee health insurance coverage, should increase our operating costs. Starting in 2014, the Reform Legislation may result in an increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have health insurance coverage. The Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, anticipates that, as a result of the Reform Legislation, millions of uninsured Americans across the nation could gain coverage through health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion. Based on CBO projections as issued on May 14, 2013, and July 30, 2013, the incremental insurance coverage due to the Reform Legislation could result in 13 million and 25 million formerly uninsured Americans gaining coverage by the end of 2014 and 2016, respectively. The CBO projects, by the end of 2016, a 45% reduction in the number of nonelderly Americans who remain uninsured due to the effects on insurance coverage from the Reform Legislation. The 29 states in which we operate hospitals include nine of the 10 states with the highest percentage of nonelderly uninsured people from among the states nonelderly population. More broadly, the 29 states in which we operate hospitals include 26 of the 30 states with the highest percentage of nonelderly uninsured people from among the states nonelderly population. We have healthcare reform outreach efforts underway in select markets. Such efforts include the expanded use of eligibility screening services, select facility designations as Certified Application Counselor Organizations, and approximately 400 volunteers and staff members trained and designated as Certified Application Counselors, or CACs. These CACs will assist people in understanding and, if appropriate, enrolling in new coverage options, including, but not limited to Qualified Health Plans, or QHPs, on the health insurance exchange or marketplace, Medicaid Expansion, the Childrens Health Insurance Program, and the Medicaid program for those eligible but not yet enrolled. Our hospitals are well positioned to participate in the provider networks of various QHPs offering plan options on the health insurance exchanges. As of December 31, 2013, 134 of 135 of our hospitals participated in a health insurance exchange agreement, 95% of our hospitals possessed two or more contracts, 90% of our hospitals had a contract with the first or second lowest cost bronze plans (QHPs with a 60% actuarial value), and 92% of our hospitals had a contract with the first or second lowest cost silver plans (QHPs with a 70% actuarial value). Most of our exchange reimbursement arrangements reflect a slight discount to that of commercial rates. Also included in the Reform Legislation are provisions aimed at reducing fraud, waste and abuse in the healthcare industry. These provisions allocate significant additional resources to federal enforcement agencies and expand the use of private contractors to recover potentially inappropriate Medicare and Medicaid payments. The Reform Legislation amends several existing federal laws, including the Medicare Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers. These amendments also make it easier for potentially severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers accused of violating applicable laws and regulations. 30 Table of Contents On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court of the United States largely upheld the constitutionality of the Reform Legislation, though it overturned an aspect of the legislation that would have permitted the Federal government to withhold all Medicaid funding from a state if that state did not expand Medicaid coverage to the extent required by the Reform Legislation. The Supreme Courts ruling instead held that only new incremental funding could be withheld from a state in such a situation. As a result, states will face less severe financial consequences if they refuse to expand Medicaid coverage to individuals with incomes below certain thresholds. Since the Supreme Courts ruling, some states have suggested that, for budgetary and other reasons, they would not expand their Medicaid programs. If states refuse to expand their Medicaid programs, the number of uninsured patients at our hospitals will decline by a smaller margin as compared to our expectations when the Reform Legislation was first adopted. In response to the Supreme Court ruling, the previous estimates of the reduction in uninsured individuals as a result of the Reform Legislation have been revised, with approximately 25 million additional individuals expected to have health insurance coverage by 2016. Of the 29 states in which we operate hospitals, 12 states are expanding their Medicaid programs. At this time, the other 17 states are not expanding Medicaid coverage. Indiana, Pennsylvania and Texas, where we operated a significant number of hospitals as of December 31, 2013, are three of the states that are not expanding Medicaid coverage. After giving effect to the HMA merger, we will also operate a significant number of hospitals in Florida and Tennessee, which also have not expanded Medicaid coverage. In addition, three of the states that are not expanding Medicaid, including Pennsylvania, are evaluating options such as waiver plans to operate an alternative Medicaid expansion plan. Because of the many variables involved, including clarifications and modifications resulting from the rule-making process, the development of agency guidance and future judicial interpretations, whether and how many states decide to expand or not to expand Medicaid coverage, the number of uninsured who elect to purchase health insurance coverage, budgetary issues at federal and state levels, and the potential for delays in the implementation of some of the provisions of the Reform Legislation, we may not be able to realize the positive impact the Reform Legislation may have on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. Furthermore, we cannot predict whether we will be able to modify certain aspects of our operations to offset any potential adverse consequences from the Reform Legislation. In a number of markets, we have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of our facilities. Such investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law, or Stark Law, that allows physicians to invest in an entire hospital (as opposed to individual hospital departments). The Reform Legislation changes the whole hospital exception to the Stark Law. The Reform Legislation permits existing physician investments in a whole hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are now prohibited, from the time the Reform Legislation became effective, from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital. The Reform Legislation also restricts the ability of existing physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities. If federal or state healthcare programs or managed care companies reduce the payments we receive as reimbursement for services we provide, our net operating revenues may decline. In 2013, 34.6% of our operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), came from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Federal healthcare expenditures continue to increase and state governments continue to face budgetary shortfalls as a result of the current economic downturn and accelerating Medicaid enrollment. As a result, federal and state governments have made, and continue to make, significant changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Some of these changes have decreased, or could decrease, the amount of money we receive for our services relating to these programs. In addition, insurance and managed care companies and other third parties from whom we receive payment for our services increasingly are attempting to control healthcare costs by requiring that hospitals discount payments for their services in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans. We believe that this trend may continue and our inability to negotiate increased reimbursement rates or maintain existing rates may reduce the payments we receive for our services. If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, including fraud and abuse laws, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations. The healthcare industry is required to comply with many laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels. These laws and regulations require that hospitals meet various requirements, including those relating to the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, compliance with building codes, environmental protection and privacy. These laws include, in part, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and a section of the Social Security Act, known as the anti-kickback statute. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including fraud and abuse laws, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. 31 Table of Contents In addition, there are heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by both federal and state government agencies relating to the healthcare industry, including the hospital segment. Recent enforcement actions have focused on financial arrangements between hospitals and physicians, billing for services without adequately documenting the medical necessity for such services and billing for services outside the coverage guidelines for such services. Specific to our hospitals, we have received inquiries and subpoenas from various governmental agencies regarding these and other matters, and we are also subject to various claims and lawsuits relating to such matters. For a further discussion of these matters, see Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Report. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. If we become subject to significant legal actions, we could be subject to substantial uninsured liabilities or increased insurance costs. In recent years, physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice, product liability, or related legal theories. Even in states that have imposed caps on damages, litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages. Many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs. To protect us from the cost of these claims, we maintain claims made professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverage in excess of those amounts for which we are self-insured. This insurance coverage is in amounts that we believe to be sufficient for our operations. However, our insurance coverage does not cover all claims against us or may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance. As a percentage of net operating revenues, our expense related to malpractice and other professional liability claims, including the cost of excess insurance, decreased by 0.2% in 2013, was relatively unchanged in 2012, and decreased by 0.2% in 2011. If these costs rise rapidly, our profitability could decline. For a further discussion of our insurance coverage, see our discussion of professional liability claims in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report. If we experience growth in self-pay volume and revenues, our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Like others in the hospital industry, we have experienced an increase in our provision for bad debts as a percentage of net operating revenues due to a growth in self-pay volume and revenues. Although we continue to seek ways of improving point of service collection efforts and implementing appropriate payment plans with our patients, if we experience growth in self-pay volume and revenues, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, our ability to improve collections for self-pay patients may be limited by statutory, regulatory and investigatory initiatives, including private lawsuits directed at hospital charges and collection practices for uninsured and underinsured patients. Currently, the global economies, and in particular the United States, are experiencing a period of economic uncertainty and the related financial markets are experiencing a high degree of volatility. This current financial turmoil is adversely affecting the banking system and financial markets and resulting in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. This uncertainty poses a risk as it could potentially lead to higher levels of uninsured patients, result in higher levels of patients covered by lower paying government programs and/or result in fiscal uncertainties at both government payors and private insurers. If there are delays in regulatory updates by governmental entities to federal and state healthcare programs, we may experience increased volatility in our operating results as such delays may result in a timing difference between when such program revenues are earned and when they become known or estimable for purposes of accounting recognition. We derive a significant amount of our net operating revenues from governmental healthcare programs, primarily from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The reimbursements due to us from those programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes that can have a significant impact on our operating results. When delays occur in the passage of regulations or legislation, there is the potential for material increases or decreases in operating revenues to be recognized in periods subsequent to when such related services were performed, resulting in the potential for a material effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. 32 Table of Contents If our implementation of electronic health record systems is not effective or exceeds our budget and timeline, our consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected. ARRA created an incentive payment program for eligible hospitals and healthcare professionals to adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health records, or EHR, technology. The implementation of EHR that meets the meaningful use criteria requires a significant capital investment, and our current plan to implement EHR anticipates maximizing the incentive payment program created by ARRA. If our hospitals and employed professionals are unable to meet the requirements for participation in the incentive payment program, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing EHR systems. As additional incentive, beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, if eligible hospitals and professionals fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology, they will be penalized with reduced reimbursement from Medicare in the form of reductions to scheduled market basket increases. If we fail to implement EHR systems effectively and in a timely manner, there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. If our development and implementation of information systems to comply with ICD-10 coding is not effective or is not implemented timely, our consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected. All healthcare providers covered by HIPAA, including our hospitals, are required to transition by October 1, 2014 to the ICD-10 code set used to report medical diagnoses and inpatient procedures. ICD-10 significantly expands the number of and detail in the codes used to bill providers for inpatient services. We are in the process of transitioning all of our hospitals to the ICD-10 coding system, which involves a significant amount of capital investment in technology and coding of our information systems, as well as significant costs for training of hospital staff involved with coding and billing. In addition to these costs for transition to ICD-10, if our hospitals are not able to meet the deadline for transition, or if there is difficulty in transitioning our coding and billing processes to this significantly more detailed code set, we could experience a material adverse effect on our operations and our consolidated results of operations.
