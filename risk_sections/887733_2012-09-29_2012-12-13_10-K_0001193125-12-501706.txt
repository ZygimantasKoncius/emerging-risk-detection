Item 1A. Risk Factors. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of factors both in and out of our control, including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. You should carefully consider the risks described below. In addition, the risks described below are not the only ones facing us. We have only described the risks we consider to be material. However, there may be additional risks that are viewed by us as not material at the present time or are not presently known to us. Conditions could change in the future, or new information may come to our attention that could impact our assessment of these risks. If any of the events described below were to occur, our business, prospects, financial condition and/or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. When we say below that something could or will 14 Table of Contents have a material adverse effect on us, we mean that it could or will have one or more of these effects. In any such case, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our company. We are in the process of implementing a transformational change within our company, which could result in increased expenses over the next few years. In fiscal 2012, we continued the process of transformational change that we embarked upon in fiscal 2011, consisting of a comprehensive series of organizational and operational initiatives intended to improve our sales and marketing, profitability and operational effectiveness. We expect to continue to implement these initiatives over the next several years. The strategic objective of these initiatives is to transform the Company from a portfolio of separately run businesses into an integrated, multi-brand company. In connection with this change, we are strengthening our management team, reorganizing operating units, consolidating facilities, developing a system of shared services and eliminating duplicative services, standardizing processes, training employees in new approaches and investing in systems, facilities and people. During fiscal 2012, we closed nine distribution and manufacturing facilities, while opening and upgrading others, leaving us with a net reduction of five facilities for fiscal year 2012. The operational issues associated with the closures, along with other supply issues, resulted in execution disruptions that delayed fulfilling orders for some customers as we transitioned certain operational activities. These disruptions adversely affected our revenues and operating earnings. While we believe we have resolved these particular issues, we may experience other operational issues as we continue to implement our transformational initiatives. These operational issues could have a material adverse effect on our performance and financial results. During fiscal 2012, we incurred approximately $12.1 million of costs related to our transformational change initiatives. We anticipate incurring substantial additional costs relating to the transformation in each of the next several years. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute the transformational change initiatives or that we will be able to do so within the anticipated time period. During the process of implementation we will be making substantial investments in our business and will incur substantial transitional costs. We anticipate that these investments and transitional costs will adversely affect our operating results until the transformation process is complete. Our operating results and cash flow are susceptible to fluctuations. We expect to continue to experience variability in our net sales, net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis. Factors that may contribute to this variability include:  fluctuations in prices of commodity grains and other input costs;  seasonality and adverse weather conditions;  costs or operational problems arising from our transformational change initiatives;  shifts in demand for lawn and garden and pet products;  changes in product mix, service levels, marketing and pricing by us and our competitors;  the effect of acquisitions, including the costs of acquisitions that are not completed; and  economic stability of and strength of our relationship with retailers. These fluctuations could negatively impact our business and the market price of our common stock. 15 Table of Contents Seeds and grains we use to produce bird feed and grass seed are commodity products subject to price volatility that has had, and could have, a negative impact on us. Our financial results are partially dependent upon the cost of raw materials and our ability to pass along increases in these costs to our customers. In particular, our Pennington and Kaytee businesses are exposed to fluctuations in market prices for commodity seeds and grains used to produce bird feed. Historically, market prices for commodity seeds and grains have fluctuated in response to a number of factors, including changes in United States government farm support programs, changes in international agricultural and trading policies and weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons. To mitigate our exposure to changes in market prices, we enter into purchase contracts for grains, bird feed and grass seed to cover a limited portion of our purchase requirements for a selling season. Since these contracts cover only a portion of our purchase requirements, as market prices for such products increase, our cost of production increases as well. In contrast, if market prices for such products decrease, we may end up purchasing grains and seeds pursuant to the purchase contracts at prices above market. In fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012, prices for some of our key crops increased substantially. Our weighted average cost per pound for our primary bird feed grains increased approximately 11% for fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Although we have been able to negotiate some price increases with our retailers, it is possible price increases may not fully offset rising costs in the future, resulting in margin erosion. We can provide no assurance as to the timing or extent of our ability to implement additional price adjustments in the context of rising costs or in the event of increased costs in the future. Similarly, we can provide no assurance of our ability to retain pricing with our retailers in the context of declining costs. We also cannot predict to what extent price increases may negatively affect our sales volume. As retailers pass along price increases, consumers may shift to our lower margin bird feed, switch to competing products or reduce purchases of wild bird feed products. A decline in consumers discretionary spending or a change in consumer preferences could reduce our sales and harm our business. Our sales ultimately depend on consumer discretionary spending, which is influenced by factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the availability of discretionary income and credit, weather, consumer confidence and unemployment levels. For fiscal 2009 and 2010, we experienced declines in sales as the result of the economic downturn. Any material decline in the amount of consumer discretionary spending could reduce our sales and harm our business. Since substantially all of our sales are in the United States, a declining U.S. economy may have a greater impact on us than on our competitors, some of which have substantial international sales. These economic and market conditions, combined with continuing difficulties in the credit markets and the resulting pressures on liquidity, may also place a number of our key retail customers under financial stress, which would increase our credit risk and potential bad debt exposure. The success of our business also depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. For example, from fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2009, the demand for aquatics products declined significantly. In fiscal 2010 and 2011, the demand for aquatic products stabilized and in fiscal 2012 it increased. Similarly, in fiscal 2010, the demand for wild bird feed declined and in fiscal 2011, demand increased. Our failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and lawn and garden and pet care needs could adversely affect the demand for our products and our profitability. Inflation, deflation, economic uncertainty and other adverse macro-economic conditions may harm our business. Our revenues and margins are dependent on various economic factors, including rates of inflation or deflation, energy costs, consumer attitudes toward discretionary spending, currency fluctuations, and other 16 Table of Contents macro-economic factors which may impact levels of consumer spending. In 2009 and 2010, our business was negatively impacted by the downturn in the housing market and by the decline in consumer confidence, as well as other macro-economic factors. During the last two years, we have experienced a significant increase in raw material input costs. Although we increased prices for many of our products, our price increases did not fully offset the increases in our costs, and our margins and profitability suffered as a result. If we are unable to pass through rising input costs and raise the price of our products, or consumer confidence continues to weaken, we may experience gross margin declines. Supply disruptions in pet birds and small animals may negatively impact our sales. The federal government and many state governments have increased restrictions on the importation of pet birds and the supply of small animals. These restrictions have resulted in reduced availability of new pet birds and animals and thus reduced demand for pet bird and small animal food and supplies. If these restrictions become more severe, our future sales of these products would likely suffer, which would negatively impact our profitability. In addition, some countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu. While the number of cases worldwide has declined, a significant outbreak in the United States would reduce demand for our pet and wild bird food and negatively impact our financial results. Our lawn and garden sales are highly seasonal and subject to adverse weather. Because our lawn and garden products are used primarily in the spring and summer, the Garden business is seasonal. In fiscal 2012, approximately 66% of our Garden segments net sales and 59% of our total net sales occurred during our second and third fiscal quarters. Substantially all of the Garden segments operating income is generated in this period. Our working capital needs and our borrowings generally peak in our second fiscal quarter, because we are generating lower revenues while incurring expenses in preparation for the spring selling season. If cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility are ever insufficient to meet our seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and summer is insufficient to repay our borrowings on a timely basis, this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because demand for lawn and garden products is significantly influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season, our results of operations and cash flow could also be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, water shortages or floods. Rising energy prices could adversely affect our operating results. During fiscal 2011 and 2012, energy prices increased substantially, which resulted in increased fuel costs for our businesses and increased raw materials costs for many of our branded products. Rising energy prices in the future could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which would reduce our sales and operating income. We depend on a few customers for a significant portion of our business. Wal*Mart, our largest customer, accounted for approximately 17% of our net sales in fiscal 2012, 16% in fiscal 2011 and 17% in fiscal 2010. Lowes accounted for approximately 9% of our net sales in fiscal 2012, 12% in fiscal 2011 and 10% in fiscal 2010. In addition, Home Depot, PetSmart and PETCO are also significant customers, although each accounted for less than 10% of our net sales and, together with Wal*Mart and Lowes, accounted for approximately 45% of our net sales in fiscal 2012and fiscal 2011, and 46% in fiscal 2010. The market shares of many of these key retailers have increased and may continue to increase in future years. The loss of, or significant adverse change in, our relationship with any of these key retailers could cause our net sales, income from operations and cash flow to decline. The loss of, or reduction in, orders from any significant customer, losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments, fees, merchandise condition or related matters, or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could reduce our income from operations and cash flow. 17 Table of Contents We may be adversely affected by trends in the retail industry. With the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation, we are increasingly dependent upon key retailers whose leverage is growing. Our business may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retailers, such as inventory destocking, limitations on access to shelf space, price demands and other conditions. In addition, as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels, there is a growing trend among retailers to make purchases on a just-in-time basis. This requires us to shorten our lead time for production in certain cases and to more closely anticipate demand, which could in the future require the carrying of additional inventories and an increase in our working capital and related financing requirements. This shift to just-in-time can also cause retailers to delay purchase orders, which can cause a shift in sales from quarter to quarter. Decisions to move in or out of a market category by leading retailers can also have a significant impact on our business. A significant deterioration in the financial condition of one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability and cash flow. We continually monitor and evaluate the credit status of our customers and attempt to adjust sales terms as appropriate. Despite these efforts, a bankruptcy filing or liquidation by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future. We cannot be certain that our product innovations and marketing successes will continue. We believe that our past performance has been based on, and our future success will depend upon, in part, our ability to continue to improve our existing products through product innovation and to develop, market and produce new products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in the introduction, marketing and production of any new products or product innovations, or that we will develop and introduce in a timely manner innovations to our existing products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. Our failure to develop new products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Issues with products may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, withdrawals, replacements of products, regulatory actions by governmental authorities that could divert resources, affect business operations, decrease sales, increase costs, and put us at a competitive disadvantage, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, issues with products that may lead to product liability, recalls, withdrawals, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities. For example, during 2012, we experienced four unrelated recalls relating to one batch of baby bird feed products, one batch of mice, rat and hamster feed, one batch of dog food and a line of Christmas tree bases. In 2012, we recorded approximately $4.9 million of costs related to these recalls. These recalls or future recalls could result in increased governmental scrutiny, reputational harm, reduced demand by consumers for our products, decreased willingness by retailer customers to purchase or provide marketing support for those products, absence or increased cost of insurance, or additional safety and testing requirements. Such results could divert development and management resources, adversely affect our business operations, decrease sales, increase legal fees and other costs, and put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other manufacturers not affected by similar issues with products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition. Competition in our industries may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, increase our profitability or maintain relationships with existing customers. We operate in highly competitive industries, which have experienced increased consolidation in recent years. We compete against numerous other companies, some of which are more established in their industries 18 Table of Contents and have substantially greater revenue and resources than we do. Our products compete against national and regional products and private label products produced by various suppliers. Our largest competitors in the Pet segment are Spectrum Brands and Hartz Mountain, and our largest competitors in the Garden segment are Scotts and Spectrum Brands. To compete effectively, among other things, we must:  develop and grow brands with leading market positions;  grow market share;  maintain our relationships with key retailers;  continually develop innovative new products that appeal to consumers;  implement effective marketing and sales promotion programs;  maintain strict quality standards;  deliver products on a reliable basis at competitive prices; and  effectively integrate acquired companies. Competition could lead to lower sales volumes, price reductions, reduced profits, losses, or loss of market share. Our inability to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks. We have completed numerous acquisitions and intend further growth through the acquisition of additional companies. We are regularly engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of companies and anticipate that one or more potential acquisition opportunities, including those that would be material, may become available in the near future. If and when appropriate acquisition opportunities become available, we intend to pursue them actively. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks, including:  failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results, as well as the potential impairment of the acquired assets if operating results decline after an acquisition;  diversion of managements attention;  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business;  additional financing, if necessary and available, which could increase leverage and costs, dilute equity, or both;  the potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles;  the high cost and expenses of identifying, negotiating and completing acquisitions; and  risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have faced, and expect to continue to face, intense competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit our ability to make acquisitions and may lead to higher acquisition prices. We cannot assure you that we 19 Table of Contents will be able to identify, acquire or manage profitably additional businesses or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses into our existing business without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties. In future acquisitions, we also could incur additional indebtedness or pay consideration in excess of fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our success depends upon our retaining key personnel. Our future performance is substantially dependent upon the continued services of William E. Brown, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gus Halas, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Central Operating Companies, and our other senior officers. The loss of the services of any of these persons could have a material adverse effect upon us. In addition, our future performance depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future. We are implementing a new enterprise resource planning information technology system. In fiscal 2005, we began incurring costs associated with designing and implementing SAP, a new company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system with the objective of gradually migrating to the new system. Upon completion, this new system will replace our numerous existing accounting and financial reporting systems, most of which were obtained in connection with business acquisitions. To date, we have reduced the number of ERP systems from 26 to 7 and expect to further reduce the number of systems during fiscal 2013. We invested an additional $14.4 million in fiscal 2012 for implementation. Capital expenditures for our new enterprise resource planning software system for fiscal 2013 and beyond will depend upon the pace of conversion for those remaining legacy systems. We accelerated the pace of our enterprise resource planning conversion in fiscal 2012. If the accelerated implementation is not executed successfully, this could result in business interruptions. If we do not complete the implementation of the project timely and successfully, we may experience, among other things, additional costs associated with completing this project and a delay in our ability to improve existing operations, support future growth and enable us to take advantage of new applications and technologies. All of this may also result in a distraction of managements time, diverting their attention from our operations and strategy. Our inability to protect our trademarks and any other proprietary rights may have a significant, negative impact on our business. We consider our trademarks to be of significant importance in our business. Although we devote resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks, we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent violation of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others or prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as an alleged violation of their trademarks and proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that future litigation by or against us will not be necessary to enforce our trademarks or proprietary rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement or the rights of others. Any future litigation of this type could result in adverse determinations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our inability to use our trademarks and other proprietary rights could also harm our business and sales through reduced demand for our products and reduced revenues. Some of the products that we manufacture and distribute require governmental permits and also subject us to potential environmental liabilities. Some of the products that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by federal, state, foreign and local authorities. Environmental health and safety laws and regulations are often complex and are subject to change. Environmental health and safety laws and regulations may affect us by restricting the manufacture, sale 20 Table of Contents or use of our products or regulating their disposal. Regulatory or legislative changes may cause future increases in our operating costs or otherwise affect operations. There is no assurance that in the future we may not be adversely affected by such laws or regulations, incur increased operating costs in complying with such regulations or that we will not be subject to claims for personal injury, property damages or governmental enforcement. In addition, due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital expenditures will not be required. In addition to operational standards, environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation, often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination. Accordingly, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. With our extensive acquisition history, we have acquired a number of manufacturing and distribution facilities. Given the nature of the past operations conducted by us and others at these properties, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified, even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination, may give rise to future remediation liabilities that may be material. Our business is dependent upon our ability to continue to source products from China. We outsource a significant amount of our manufacturing requirements to third party manufacturers located in China. This international sourcing subjects us to a number of risks, including: the impact on sourcing or manufacturing of public health and contamination risks in China; social and political disturbances and instability; export duties, import controls, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers; shipping and transportation problems; and fluctuations in currency values. Because we rely on Chinese third-party manufacturers for a substantial portion of our product needs, any disruption in our relationships with these manufacturers could adversely affect our operations. The products that we manufacture could expose us to product liability claims. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks in the manufacture and distribution of certain of our products. Although we generally seek to insure against such risks, there can be no assurance that such coverage is adequate or that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms. A successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on us and could prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially reasonable terms. Deterioration in operating results could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness or impact our ability to refinance our debt on favorable terms as it matures. We have, and we will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness. As of September 29, 2012, we had total indebtedness of approximately $449.8 million. This level of indebtedness and future borrowing needs could have material adverse consequences for our business, including:  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the terms of our indebtedness;  require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other business activities;  increase our vulnerability to adverse industry conditions, including unfavorable weather conditions or continued commodity price increases; 21 Table of Contents  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and  limit our ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable rates, if at all. In addition, since a portion of our debt commitments bear interest at variable rates, an increase in interest rates or interest rate margins as defined under the credit agreement will create higher debt service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow. We are subject to cyber security risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, suppliers and others, including personal identification information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly-evolving types of cyber attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers and suppliers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation. We do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. We have never declared nor paid any cash dividends on our common stock or Class A common stock and currently do not intend to do so. Provisions of our credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes restrict our ability to pay cash dividends. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to limitations under applicable law and contractual restrictions, and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or Class A common stock that could dilute the value and market price of your stock. We may decide or be required to issue, including upon the exercise of any outstanding stock options, or in connection with any acquisition made by us, additional shares of our common stock or Class A common stock that could dilute the value of your common stock or Class A common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or Class A common stock. Our Chairman, through his holdings of our Class B common stock, could exercise effective control of the Company, which may discourage potential acquisitions of our business and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock. Holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to the lesser of ten votes per share or 49% of the total votes cast, and each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time into one share of our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share owned. Holders of our Class A common stock and Series B preferred stock have no voting rights, except as required by Delaware law. 22 Table of Contents As of November 30, 2012, William E. Brown, our Chairman, beneficially owned 1,600,459 shares of our Class B common stock (out of a total of 1,652,262 outstanding shares), 1,418,063 shares of our common stock and 3,259,404 shares of our Class A common stock and thereby controlled approximately 55% of the voting power of our capital stock. Accordingly, except to the extent that a class vote of the common stock is required by applicable law, he can effectively control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our directors, and can exert substantial control over our management and policies. The disproportionate voting rights of our common stock and Class B common stock and Mr. Browns substantial holdings of Class B common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and Class A common stock. Also, such disproportionate voting rights and Mr. Browns controlling interest may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be, or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, tender offer or proxy contest, even if such actions were favored by our other stockholders, which could thereby deprive holders of common stock or Class A common stock of an opportunity to sell their shares for a take-over premium. We have authorized the issuance of shares of common stock, Class A common stock and preferred stock, which may discourage potential acquisitions of our business and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our Class A common stock. Pursuant to our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 80,000,000 shares of our common stock, 100,000,000 shares of our nonvoting Class A common stock and up to 1,000,000 additional shares of preferred stock without seeking the approval or consent of our stockholders, unless required by the NASDAQ Global Market. Although the issuance of the nonvoting Class A common stock would not dilute the voting rights of the existing stockholders, it could have a dilutive effect on the economic interest of currently outstanding shares of common stock and Class B common stock similar to the dilutive effect of subsequent issuances of ordinary common stock. The issuance of the preferred stock could, depending on the rights and privileges designated by the board with respect to any particular series, have a dilutive effect on the voting interests of the common stock and Class B common stock and the economic interests of our common stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock. In addition, the disproportionate voting rights of our common stock, preferred stock, Class B common stock and Class A common stock, and the ability of the board to issue stock to persons friendly to current management, may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, tender offer or proxy contest, even if such actions were favored by our common stockholders, which could thereby deprive holders of common stock of an opportunity to sell their shares for a take-over premium.
