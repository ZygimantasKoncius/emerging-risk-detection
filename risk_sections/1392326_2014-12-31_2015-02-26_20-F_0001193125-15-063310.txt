Risk FactorsRisks Inherent in an Investment in UsUnitholders have limited voting rights and our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 5% or more of our units. above for more information on additional restrictions imposed by our partnership agreement. We currently do not have any officers and rely, and expect to continue to rely, solely on officers of our general partner, who face conflicts in the allocation of their time to our business. Our board of directors has not exercised its power to appoint officers of CPLP to date, and as a result, we rely, and expect to continue to rely, solely on the officers of our general partner, who are not required to work full-time on our affairs and who also work for affiliates of our general partner, including Capital Maritime. For example, our general partners Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer is also an executive officer of Capital Maritime. The affiliates of our general partner conduct substantial businesses and activities of their own in which we have no economic interest. As a result, there could be material competition for the time and effort of the officers of our general partner who also provide services to our general partners affiliates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our partnership agreement limits our general partners and our directors fiduciary duties to our unitholders and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner or our directors. 46 Table of Contents Our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce the standards to which our general partner and directors would otherwise be held by Marshall Islands law. For example, our partnership agreement:  permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner. Where our partnership agreement permits, our general partner may consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and in such cases it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our unitholders. Decisions made by our general partner in its individual capacity will be made by its sole owner, Capital Maritime. Specifically, pursuant to our partnership agreement, our general partner will be considered to be acting in its individual capacity if it exercises its call right, preemptive rights or registration rights, consents or withholds consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership, appoints any directors or votes for the election of any director, votes or refrains from voting on amendments to our partnership agreement that require a vote of the outstanding units, voluntarily withdraws from the partnership, transfers (to the extent permitted under our partnership agreement) or refrains from transferring its units, general partner interest or IDRs, or votes upon the dissolution of the partnership;  provides that our general partner and our directors are entitled to make other decisions in good faith if they reasonably believe that the decision is in our best interests;  generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the conflicts committee of our board of directors and not involving a vote of unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or be fair and reasonable to us and that, in determining whether a transaction or resolution is fair and reasonable, our board of directors may consider the totality of the relationships between the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us; and  provides that neither our general partner and its officers nor our directors will be liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or directors or its officers or directors or those other persons engaged in actual fraud or willful misconduct. In order to become a limited partner of our partnership, a unitholder is required to agree to be bound by the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a person or group from attempting to remove our current management or our general partner, and even if public unitholders are dissatisfied, they will be unable to remove our general partner without Capital Maritimes consent unless Capital Maritimes ownership share in us is below a specified threshold, all of which could diminish the trading price of our units. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a person or group from attempting to remove our current management or our general partner:  The unitholders will be unable to remove our general partner without its consent so long as our general partner and its affiliates own sufficient units to be able to prevent such removal. The vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of all outstanding units voting together as a single class and a majority vote of our board of directors is required to remove the general partner. As of December 31, 2014, the Marinakis family, including Evangelos M. Marinakis, our former chairman, may be deemed to beneficially own on a fully converted basis a 17.6% and on a non-fully converted basis a 19.9% interest in us through its beneficial ownership of common units through, among others, Capital Maritime.  Common unitholders elect five of the eight members of our board of directors. Our general partner in its sole discretion has the right to appoint the remaining three directors.  Election of the five directors elected by common unitholders is staggered, meaning that the members of only one of three classes of our elected directors are selected each year. In addition, the directors appointed by our general partner will serve for terms determined by our general partner. 47 Table of Contents  Our partnership agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings of unitholders, to nominate directors and to acquire information about our operations as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of management.  Unitholders voting rights are further restricted by the partnership agreement provision providing that if any person or group, other than our general partner, its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of our board of directors, owns beneficially 5% or more of any class of units then outstanding, any such units owned by that person or group in excess of 4.9% may not be voted on any matter and will not be considered to be outstanding when sending notices of a meeting of unitholders, calculating required votes, except for purposes of nominating a person for election to our board, determining the presence of a quorum or for other similar purposes, unless required by law. The voting rights of any such unitholders in excess of 4.9% will be redistributed pro rata among the other common unitholders holding less than 4.9% of the voting power of all classes of units entitled to vote.  We have substantial latitude in issuing equity securities without unitholder approval. One effect of these provisions may be to diminish the price at which our units will trade. The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders. In addition, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the members of our general partner from transferring their respective membership interests in our general partner to a third party. Any such change in control of our general partner may affect the way we and our operations are managed which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions. Future sales of our common units, or the issuance of additional preferred units, debt securities or warrants, could cause the market price of our common units to decline. The market price of our common units could decline due to sales of a large number of units, or the issuance of debt securities or warrants, in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales could also make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate to raise funds through future offerings of common units. In addition, pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement, holders of our Class B Units may convert all or a portion of their Class B Units into common units at any time, and from time to time, at a ratio of one-for-one, such conversion ratio to be adjusted in the event that, among other certain anti-dilution protection provisions, the distribution rate on our common units is increased. As of December 31, 2014, certain Class B unitholders, including Capital Maritime, have converted an aggregate of 10,431,817 Class B Units into 10,431,817 common units. As of December 31, 2014, there were 14,223,737 Class B Units outstanding. During 2014, our sponsor converted 358,624 common units into general partner units and delivered such units to our general partner in order for it to maintain its 2% interest in us. For a more thorough description of the rights and privileges of our Class B unitholders under our partnership agreement, including voting rights, please refer to our partnership agreement, as amended, filed as Exhibit I to our Current Report on Form 6-K dated February 22, 2010, as Exhibit I to our Current Report on Form 6-K dated September 30, 2011, as Exhibit II to our Current Report on Form 6-K/A dated May 23, 2012, as Exhibit II to our Current Report on Form 6-K dated March 21, 2013 and as Exhibit A to Exhibit I to our Current Report on Form 6-K dated August 26, 2014. We may issue additional equity securities without your approval, which would dilute your ownership interests. We may, without the approval of our unitholders, issue an unlimited number of additional units or other equity securities, including securities to Capital Maritime. To date, we have issued and outstanding 14,223,737 Class B Units to certain investors, which are convertible on a one-for-one basis into common units under certain circumstances, and have also issued 24,967,240 common units to holders of Crude Carriers shares, in a unit-for-share transaction consummated in September 2011 whereby Crude Carriers became a wholly owned subsidiary of 48 Table of Contents ours. We have also issued common units in connection with the acquisition of certain of our vessels, either directly to Capital Maritime or through public offerings, including an issuance of 279,286 common units in August 2013 in connection with the purchase of the Hyundai Prestige, Hyundai Privilege and Hyundai Platinum. In addition, on August 21, 2014, following approval obtained from our limited partners at our 2014 annual meeting, we amended and restated our Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, adopted in April 2008, as amended (the Plan), to increase the maximum number of restricted units authorized for issuance thereunder from 800,000 to 1,650,000, of which 795,200 have been previously issued and have vested. We also issued an aggregate of 17,250,000 common units in a public offering in September 2014, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option of 2,250,000 common units. In accordance with the terms of such offering, we used part of the proceeds from such offering to acquire from Capital Maritime 5,950,610 common units, which were canceled immediately after their acquisition. We may make additional such issuances in the future. The issuance by us of additional units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank may have the following effects:  our unitholders proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;  the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and  the market price of the units may decline. Our general partner has a limited call right that may require you to sell your units at an undesirable time or price. If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 90% of the common units, our general partner will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, but not the obligation, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units or subordinated units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then-current market price. As a result, you may be required to sell your common units or subordinated units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on your investment. You may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of your units. You may not have limited liability if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business. As a limited partner in a partnership organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, you could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if you participate in the control of our business (and the person who transacts business with us reasonably believes, based on the limited partners conduct, that the limited partner is a general partner). Our general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities. In addition, the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some jurisdictions in which we do business. Please read The Partnership AgreementLimited Liability in our Registration Statement on Form F-1 filed with the SEC on March 19, 2007, for a more detailed discussion of the implications of the limitations on liability to a unitholder. We can borrow money to pay distributions, which would reduce the amount of credit available to operate our business. Our partnership agreement allows us to make working capital borrowings to pay distributions. Accordingly, we can make distributions on all our units even though cash generated by our operations may not be sufficient to pay such distributions. Any working capital borrowings by us to make distributions will reduce the amount of working capital borrowings we can make for operating our business. For more information, please read Item 5B: Liquidity and Capital ResourcesBorrowings. Increases in interest rates may cause the market price of our common units to decline. An increase in interest rates may cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments in general, and in particular for yield based equity investments such as our common units. Any such increase in interest rates or reduction in demand for our common units resulting from other relatively more attractive investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our common units to decline. 49 Table of Contents Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions. Under some circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under the Marshall Islands Limited Partnership Act (the MILPA), we may not make a distribution if the distribution would cause our liabilities (other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specified property of ours) to exceed the fair value of our assets, except that the fair value of property that is subject to a liability for which the recourse of creditors is limited shall be included in our assets only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that liability. The MILPA provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated the MILPA will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Assignees who become substituted limited partners are liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that are known to the assignee at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from the partnership agreement. We have incurred, and may continue to incur significant costs in complying with the requirements of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If management is unable to continue to provide reports as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to continue to provide us with unqualified attestation reports as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our common units. We completed our IPO on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on April 3, 2007. As a publicly traded limited partnership, we are required to comply with the SECs reporting requirements and with corporate governance and related requirements of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, on which our common units are listed. Section 404 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX 404) requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and include in our reports filed with the SEC our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a related attestation of our independent registered public accounting firm. Our sponsor, Capital Maritime, provides substantially all of our financial reporting and we depend on the procedures they have in place. If, in such future annual reports on Form 20-F, our management cannot provide a report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified attestation report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by SOX 404, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our common units. We have and expect we will continue to have to dedicate a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements of SOX 404. We will continue to work with our legal, accounting and financial advisors to identify any areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. However, these and other measures we may take may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely and reliable basis. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We have incurred and will continue to incur legal, accounting and other expenses in complying with these and other applicable regulations. We anticipate that our incremental general and administrative expenses as a publicly traded limited partnership taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes will include costs associated with annual reports to unitholders, tax returns, investor relations, registrar and transfer agents fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and director compensation. Our organization as a limited partnership under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands may limit the ability of our unitholders to protect their interests. Our affairs are governed by our partnership agreement and the MILPA. The provisions of the MILPA resemble provisions of the limited partnership laws of a number of states in the United States, most notably Delaware. The MILPA also provides that it is to be applied and construed to make the laws of the Marshall Islands, 50 Table of Contents with respect to the subject matter of the MILPA, uniform with the laws of the State of Delaware and, so long as it does not conflict with the MILPA or decisions of the High and Supreme Courts of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the non-statutory law (or case law) of the State of Delaware is adopted as the law of the Marshall Islands. However, there have been few, if any, judicial cases in the Republic of the Marshall Islands interpreting the MILPA. For example, the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain U.S. jurisdictions. Although the MILPA does specifically incorporate the non-statutory law, or judicial case law, of the State of Delaware, our public unitholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions by management, directors or controlling unitholders than would shareholders of a limited partnership organized in a U.S. jurisdiction. It may not be possible for investors to enforce U.S. judgments against us. We are organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, as is our general partner and most of our subsidiaries. Most of our directors and the directors and officers of our general partner and those of our subsidiaries are residents of countries other than the United States. Substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for U.S. investors to serve process within the United States upon us or to enforce judgment upon us for civil liabilities in U.S. courts. In addition, you should not assume that courts in the countries in which we or our subsidiaries are incorporated or organized or where our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries are located (1) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us or our subsidiaries based upon the civil liability provisions of applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws or (2) would impose, in original actions, liabilities against us or our subsidiaries based upon these laws. TAX RISKS In addition to the following risk factors, you should read Item 10E: Taxation below for a more complete discussion of the expected material U.S. federal and non-U.S. income tax considerations relating to us and the ownership and disposition of our units. U.S. tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company, which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. unitholders. A foreign entity taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be treated as a passive foreign investment company (a PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if (x) at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of passive income, or (y) at least 50% of the average value of the entitys assets produce or are held for the production of those types of passive income. For purposes of these tests, passive income includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment property, and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties that are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the performance of services does not constitute passive income. U.S. persons who own shares of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U.S. federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions they receive from the PFIC, and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC. Based on our current and projected method of operation, we believe that we are not currently a PFIC and we do not expect to become a PFIC in the future. We intend to treat our income from spot and time chartering activities as non-passive income, and the vessels engaged in those activities as non-passive assets, for PFIC purposes. However, no assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) or a United States court will accept this position, and there is accordingly a risk that the IRS or a United States court could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we would not constitute a PFIC for any future taxable year if there were to be changes in our assets, income or operations. See Item 10E: TaxationMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsU.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. HoldersPFIC Status and Significant Tax Consequences. 51 Table of Contents We may have to pay tax on United States source income, which would reduce our earnings. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), 50% of the gross shipping income of a vessel owning or chartering corporation that is attributable to transportation that either begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States is characterized as U.S. source shipping income and such income generally is subject to a 4% U.S. federal income tax without allowance for deduction, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 of the Code. We believe that we and each of our subsidiaries will qualify for this statutory tax exemption, and we will take this position for U.S. federal income tax return reporting purposes. See Item 10E: TaxationMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsThe Section 883 Exemption. However, there are factual circumstances, including some that may be beyond our control, which could cause us to lose the benefit of this tax exemption. In addition, our conclusion that we currently qualify for this exemption is based upon legal authorities that do not expressly contemplate an organizational structure such as ours. Although we have elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, for corporate law purposes we are organized as a limited partnership under Marshall Islands law. Our general partner will be responsible for managing our business and affairs and has been granted certain veto rights over decisions of our board of directors. Therefore, we can give no assurances that the IRS will not take a different position regarding our qualification, or the qualification of any of our subsidiaries, for this tax exemption. If we or our subsidiaries are not entitled to this exemption under Section 883 of the Code for any taxable year, we or our subsidiaries generally would be subject for those years to a 4% U.S. federal gross income tax on our U.S. source shipping income. The imposition of this taxation could have a negative effect on our business and would result in decreased earnings available for distribution to our unitholders. You may be subject to income tax in one or more non-U.S. countries, including Greece, as a result of owning our units if, under the laws of any such country, we are considered to be carrying on business there. Such laws may require you to file a tax return with and pay taxes to those countries. We intend that our affairs and the business of each of our subsidiaries will be conducted and operated in a manner that minimizes income taxes imposed upon us and these subsidiaries or which may be imposed upon you as a result of owning our units. However, because we are organized as a partnership, there is a risk in some jurisdictions that our activities and the activities of our subsidiaries may be attributed to our unitholders for tax purposes and, thus, that you will be subject to tax in one or more non-U.S. countries, including Greece, as a result of owning our units if, under the laws of any such country, we are considered to be carrying on business there. If you are subject to tax in any such country, you may be required to file a tax return with and pay tax in that country based on your allocable share of our income. We may be required to reduce distributions to you on account of any withholding obligations imposed upon us by that country in respect of such allocation to you. The United States may not allow a tax credit for any foreign income taxes that you directly or indirectly incur. We believe we can conduct our activities in a manner so that our unitholders should not be considered to be carrying on business in Greece solely as a consequence of acquiring, holding, disposing of or participating in the redemption of our units. However, the question of whether either we or any of our subsidiaries will be treated as carrying on business in any country, including Greece, will largely be a question of fact determined through an analysis of contractual arrangements, including the management and the administrative services agreements we have entered into with Capital Ship Management, and the way we conduct business or operations, all of which may change over time. The laws of Greece or any other foreign country may also change, which could cause the countrys taxing authorities to determine that we are carrying on business in such country and are subject to its taxation laws. Any foreign taxes imposed on us or any subsidiaries will reduce our cash available for distribution.
