Risk FactorsThe price of the Groups principal raw material is difficult to predict. The Group also purchases fibers and microfibers for use in coverings. Both kinds of coverings are divided into several price categories: most fabrics are in the highest price categories, while the most inexpensive of the microfibers are in the lowest price categories. Fabrics are purchased exclusively in Italy from 13 suppliers which provide the product at the finished stage. Microfibers are purchased in Italy, South Korea, Taiwan, through four suppliers who provide them at the finished stage. Microfibers purchased from the Groups Italian supplier are in some cases imported by the supplier at the greige or semi-finished stage and then finished (dyed and bonded) in Italy. Fabrics and microfibers are generally purchased from the suppliers pursuant to orders given every week specifying the quantity (in linear meters) and the delivery date. The price is determined before the fiber or microfiber is introduced into the collection. Fabrics and microfibers purchased from the Italian suppliers are delivered directly by the suppliers to the Groups facility in Laterza, while those purchased outside of Italy are delivered to an Italian port and then sent to the Laterza facility. Microfibers and fabrics included into Italsofa and Natuzzi Editions are delivered directly by the suppliers to Chinese and Brazilian ports and then sent to the Groups Shanghai and Salvador de Bahia facilities. The Group is able to purchase such products at reasonable prices as a result of the volume of its orders. The Group continuously searches for alternative supply sources in order to obtain the best product at the best price. Price performance of fabrics is quite different from that of microfibers. Because fabrics are purchased exclusively in Italy and are composed of natural fibers, their prices are influenced by the cost of labor and the quality of the product. During 2008 and the beginning of 2009, fabric prices were stable due to long-term relationships with suppliers and the large volumes purchased by the Group. During the same period microfiber prices decreased due to the introduction of new suppliers and the renegotiation of prices with current suppliers. The price of microfibers is mainly influenced by the international availability of high-quality products and raw materials at low costs, especially from Asian markets. 19 Table of Contents The Group obtains the chemicals required for the production of polyurethane foam from major chemical companies located in Europe (including Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) and the polyester fiber filling for its polyester fiber-filled cushions from several suppliers located mainly in Korea, China and Taiwan. The chemical components of polyurethane foam are petroleum-based commodities, and the prices for such components are therefore subject to, among other things, fluctuations in the price of crude oil, which has decreased over the last months. The Group obtains wood and wood products for its wooden frames from suppliers in Italy and Eastern Europe. Through its plant located in Romania, the Group has begun engaging directly in the cutting and transportation of wood from Romanian forests. With regard to the Groups collection of home furnishing accessories (tables, lamps, carpets, home accessories in different materials), most of the suppliers are located in Italy and other European countries, while some hand-made products (such as carpets) are made in India. Supply-Chain Management Procurement Policies and Operations Integration  In order to improve customer service and reduce industrial costs, the Group in 2008 established a definitive policy for handling suppliers and supply logistics. All of the sub-departments working in the Logistics Department have been reorganized to maximize efficiency throughout the supply-chain. The Logistics Department now coordinates periodic meetings among all of its working groups in order to identify areas of concern that arise in the supply-chain, and to identify solutions that will be acceptable to all groups. The Logistics Department is responsible for monitoring the proposed solutions in order to ensure their effectiveness. Additionally, in order to improve access to supply-chain information throughout the Group, the Logistics Department (with the support of the Information Systems department) has created a new portal that allows the Logistics Department and other departments (such as Customer Service and Sales) to monitor the movement of goods through the supply-chain. Production Planning (Order Management, Production, Procurement)  The Groups commitment to reorganizing procurement logistics has led to: 1) the development of a logistic-production model to customize the level of service to customers; 2) a 47% reduction in the size of the Groups inventory of raw materials and/or components, particularly those pertaining to coverings. This positive impact was made possible by both the development of software that allows more detailed production programming and broader access by suppliers themselves, and a more general reorganization of supplier relationships. Suppliers are now able to provide assembly lines at Italian plants with requested components within four hours; 3) the planning and partial completion of the industrial reorganization of the local production center; and 4) since January 2009, the SAP system has been implemented through the organization. 20 Table of Contents The Group also plans procurements of raw materials and components: i) On demand for those materials and components (which the Group identifies by code numbers) that require a shorter lead time for order completion than the standard production planning cycle for customers orders. This system allows the Group to handle a higher number of product combinations (in terms of models, versions and coverings) for customers all over the world, while maintaining a high level of service and minimizing inventory size. Procuring raw materials and components on demand eliminates the risk that these materials and components would become obsolete during the production process; or ii) Upon forecast for those materials and components requiring a long lead time for order completion. The Group utilizes a new forecast methodology, developed in cooperation with a consulting firm. This methodology balances the Groups desire to maintain low inventory levels against the Sales Departments needs for flexibility in filling orders, all the while maintaining high customer satisfaction levels. This new methodology is currently being developed together with the Groups Information Systems Department, in order to create a new intranet portal, called Worldwide Demand Planning tool. This tool is working for sales coming from the North American market, under the supervision of a forecast manager. Once completed, it will further support corporate logistics and operations managers to better forecast the future demand for the Groups products so as to improve the lead time from material supply to sales delivery. Special production programsthose requiring lead times shorter than three weeksare only available to a restricted group of customers, for a limited group of collections and product combinations. Lead times can be longer than those mentioned above when a high number of unexpected orders is received. Delivery times vary depending on the place of discharge (transport lead times vary widely depending on the distance between the final destination and the production plant). All planning activities (finished goods load optimization, customer order acknowledgement, production and suppliers planning) are synchronized in order to guarantee that during the production process, the correct materials are located in the right place at the right time, thereby achieving a maximum level of service while minimizing handling and transportation costs. Load Optimization  With the aim of decreasing costs and safeguarding product quality, the Group attains optimum load levels for shipping by using a software developed through a research partnership with the University of Bari and the University of Copenhagen, completed in June 2006. This software manages customers orders to be shipped by sea with the goal of maximizing the number of orders shipped in full containers. If a customers order does not make optimal use of container space, revisions to the order quantities are suggested. This activity, which was previously a prerogative of the Groups headquarters, has been almost completely transferred to Natuzzi Americas in High Point, North Carolina. Now, this software is also undergoing testing by customers. As far as the load composition by truck is concerned, the Group has commissioned planning a software development project to minimize total transport costs by taking into account volume and route optimization for customers orders in defined areas. A prototype of this software was delivered to the Group in November 2007. The Group concluded testing of this prototype in September 2008 and it is currently operational. This software was developed by the Group jointly with Polytechnic of Bari and the University of Lecce. 21 Table of Contents Transportation  The Group delivers goods to customers by common carriers. Those goods destined for the Americas and other markets outside Europe are transported by sea in 40 high cube containers, while those produced for the European market are generally delivered by truck and, in some cases, by railway. In 2008, the Group shipped 11,000 containers (40hc) to overseas countries and approximately 6,700 full load mega-trailer trucks to European destinations. To improve service levels, a method of Supplier Vendor Rating is under development to measure performance of carriers and distributors providing direct service. This rating system has first been extended to transport by land, and, later, also to the transport by sea. The Group relies principally on several shipping and trucking companies operating under time-volume service contracts to deliver its products to customers and to transport raw materials to the Groups plants and processed materials from one plant to another. In general, the Group prices its products to cover its door-to-door shipping costs, including all customs duties and insurance premiums. Some of the Groups overseas suppliers are responsible for delivering raw materials to the port of departure, therefore transportation costs for these materials are generally under the Groups control. At the same time, a transportation tender has been organized during 2008. This tender involves worldwide transportation companies; the concept is to have a better service for our customers at a cheaper price reducing the number of transport companies involved in the inbound & outbound flow. Products The Group is committed to the conception, prototyping, production (sofas only) and commercialization of a wide range of upholstered furniture, both in leather and in fabric, and furnishings & accessories. The Company is the largest Italian company in the sector and a world leader in the segment of upholstered furniture. The wide range of offerings enables the Company to reach specific market segments, constantly monitor consumers needs and offer products in line with market trends and final customers preferences. New models are the result of a constant information flow that stems from the market (whose preferences are analyzed, filtered and translated by the product managers into a brief, including specific styles, functions and price points), and is communicated to the group of designers who, through constant work with the team from the prototypes department, sketches the creation of new products in accordance with the guidelines received. The product development process is also based on specific needs of particular clients (mass dealers) who are capable of generating a critical mass of sales that enable the product to achieve the right market penetration. The diversity of final customers tastes and preferences and the natural inclination of Natuzzi to offer new solutions promote the development of products that are increasingly personalized. For instance, in 2008, the Company developed 117 new models that have generated more than 2201 different versions. 22 Table of Contents The Groups product range falls within five broad categories of furniture: stationary furniture (sofas, loveseats and armchairs); sectional furniture; motion furniture; sofa beds; and occasional chairs (including recliners and body massage chairs). As of April 30, 2009, the Group offered its products in 403 different models. Regarding the supply of furnishing & accessories, 28 new products were introduced in 2008 as a result of a significant push on development. The Groups wide range of products includes a comprehensive collection of sofas and armchairs with particular styles, coverings and functions, with more than two million combinations. The Groups offering is divided into two separate collections: the Natuzzi Collection, which has two separate lines of products, one targeting the Americas (Natuzzi Editions) and one targeting the Groups markets in the rest of the world, and the Italsofa Collection, which is also divided into two lines of products, those targeting the Americas and the Asia Pacific region, and those targeting Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The Natuzzi Collection, positioned in the medium-high market, focuses on making Italian quality and style accessible through coordinated and innovative living rooms. This collection stands out for high quality in the choice of materials and finishes, as well as the creativity and details of its designs. As of April 30, 2009, this line of products offered 164 models, 26 articles in fabrics in 86 colors, 16 leather articles in 119 colors, and four articles in dreamfiber in 51 colors. The best-selling models in 2008 were Klaus, Plaza, Malcolm and Nicolaus (generating respectively  14.7 million,  12.5 million,  10.9 million and  10.8 million in sales). The collection also includes a selection of additional furniture (wall units, tables, lamps, carpets), accessories (pots and candles), furniture for the dining room (tables, chairs, lamps) to offer complete furniture with the aim enabling the Group to become a real Lifestyle Company. As of April 30, 2009, the Natuzzi Collections line oriented to the Americas named Natuzzi Editions was represented by 105 models, 21 leather articles in 108 colors, and nine articles in dreamfiber & fabrics in 44 colors. The Ginevra model is the best-selling model with sales of about  6.1 million during 2008. The Italsofa Collection, which is characterized by a young and vibrant style, offers for the medium-to-medium low market, 134 models, 10 leather articles in 76 colors, two articles in dreamfiber and 14 fabric articles in 30 colors. The most successful model is the Otranto, with  7.3 million in sales during 2008. The Groups overall sales are also partly the result of unbranded production, developed on the basis of specific provision agreements for important mass-dealer clients like IKEA and Macys. 23 Table of Contents Markets The Group markets its products internationally as well as in Italy. Outside Italy, the Group sells its leather furniture principally on a wholesale basis to major retailers and furniture stores. In 1990, the Group began selling its leather-upholstered products in Italy and abroad through franchised Divani & Divani by Natuzzi and Natuzzi furniture stores. Since 2001, the Group has also sold its furniture through directly owned Natuzzi stores and Divani & Divani by Natuzzi stores. Starting from the second half of 2007, the Group has sold its promotional line in China through Italsofa stores, of which there were 16 as of the end of 2008. In 2008, the Group derived 35.5% of its leather and fabric-upholstered furniture net sales from the United States and the Americas, 55.1% from Europe and 9.4% from the rest of the world.

In 2008, net sales of leather and fabric-upholstered furniture in the United States and the Americas increased 5.04% to  208.6 million, compared to  198.6 million in 2007, and the number of seats sold increased 8.16% to 1,272,559 compared to 1,176,585 in 2007. The Groups sales in the United States and the Americas are handled by Natuzzi Americas, which maintains offices in High Point, North Carolina, the heart of the most important furniture manufacturing and distributing region in the United States. The staff at High Point provides customer service, marketing and logistics, handles finance and collections, and generally acts as the customers contact for the Group. As of April 30, 2009, the High Point operation had 68 employees. Natuzzi Americas has 38 independent sales representatives and sub-representatives in the United States and Canada. They are regionally supervised by sales managers. The Groups principal customers are major retailers. The Group advertises its products to retailers and, recently, to consumers in the United States and Canada directly and through the use of various marketing tools. The Group also relies on its network of sales representatives and on the furniture fairs held at High Point each Spring and Fall to promote its products. 25 Table of Contents 2. Europe. During 2008, the Group continued to consolidate its position in Europe by investing in stores and galleries. Net sales of leather and fabric-upholstered furniture in Europe increased by 1.3% from  319.4 million in 2007 to  323.7 million in 2008, with the number of seats sold slightly decreased from 1,225,882 in 2007 to 1,211,939 seats sold in 2008. Italy. Since 1990, the Group has sold its upholstered products within Italy principally through franchised Divani & Divani furniture stores (now Divani & Divani by Natuzzi). As of April 30, 2009, there were 108 Divani & Divani by Natuzzi stores and one Natuzzi store located in Italy. Eighteen of these stores are directly owned by the Group. Outside Italy. The Group uses franchised or directly owned stores to penetrate markets and implement brand strategies. As of April 30, 2009, 91 franchised single-brand stores were operating in Europe (outside Italy): 21 under the Divani & Divani by Natuzzi name (eight in Greece and 13 in Portugal) and the remainder under the Natuzzi name (25 in France, nine in Holland, five in Russia, three in the Czech Republic, two in Germany, two in Malta, two in Cyprus, two in Croatia, two in Poland, two in Latvia, two in Slovenia, two in Turkey, two in Romania, and one each in Iceland, Lithuania, Finland, Estonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Hungary, Belgium, Serbia-Montenegro, the United Kingdom and Ukraine). As of April 30, 2009, there were 38 directly owned stores in Europe (outside Italy): 25 in Spain (of which one is an outlet), five in Switzerland, four in the United Kingdom, three in Denmark and one in Sweden, all under the Natuzzi name. Apart from the four Natuzzi stores located in the United Kingdom, the Group operates 17 concessions in the United Kingdom and one in the Republic of Ireland. 3. Rest of the World. Middle East. The Group has seen a significant increase in demand, especially in Israel where net sales increased from  1.4 million in 2007 to  2.6 million in 2008. As of April 30, 2009, the Group had a total of nine Natuzzi stores in the Middle East: three in Israel, two in the United Arab Emirates, two in Saudi Arabia and one each in Kuwait and Qatar. The Group also had a total of six galleries: two in Saudi Arabia and one each in Bahrain, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan. Asia-Oceania-Africa. In 2008, the overall net sales in this region equaled  37.3 million. Until the end of the year, the business was managed through the regional management integrated in Italsofa Shanghai Ltd. and supported by the subsidiary in Japan and three agencies located in Australia, South Korea and New Zealand. Since the beginning of 2009, a new legal entity has been set upNatuzzi Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.which acts as a regional office and manages the commercial part of the business throughout the region. Furthermore, the Group is also currently preparing a representative office in Sydney, in order to be closer to the Australian and New Zealand markets. This office will report to the regional office in Shanghai. The general strategy for the Natuzzi brand is to further expand the store network throughout the region, but with a strong emphasis on China. As of April 30, 2009, 50 franchised single-brand Natuzzi stores were operating in the Asia Pacific market: 20 in China, 19 in Australia, five in Taiwan, two in New Zealand, and one each in the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. The Group also maintains 13 galleries in the Asia-Oceania-Africa region with locations in South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, Thailand, Indonesia, Korea, New Zealand. The Group also has a gallery presence in Australia, specifically at 28 David Jones department stores. 26 Table of Contents In 2007, the Group launched an initiative to redefine the image of its Italsofa brand, and opened a total of five single brand Italsofa stores in China with the objective of positioning Italsofa within a higher market segment as compared to very-low-cost Chinese competitors. As of April 30, 2009, the Italsofa single-branded store network in China has increased to 14 stores in different areas of China. The Group is currently planning to further expand its presence in China, specifically with stores in medium-sized and small cities all over the country. Customer Credit Management  The Group maintains an active credit management program. The Group evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers on a case-by-case basis according to each customers credit history and information available to the Group. Throughout the world, the Group utilizes open terms in 86% of its sales and obtains credit insurance for almost 78% of this amount; 12% of the Groups sales are commonly made to customers on a cash against documents and cash on delivery basis; and lastly, 2% of the Groups sales are supported by a letter of credit or payment in advance. Advertising  The Group uses the Natuzzi brand for its medium-to higher-priced product line. The Groups Communication System was developed to regulate all methods used in each market to advertise the brand name, and operates simultaneously on different levels: the brand-building level establishes the brands philosophy, while the traffic-building level aims to attract consumers to points of sale using various kinds of initiatives, such as presentations of new collections, new store openings and promotional activities. Advertising in the galleries is carried out with the help of the Retail Advertising Kit, a collection of templates that enable advertising of the Natuzzi brand in conjunction with the retailers brand. Incentive Programs and Tax Benefits Historically, the Group derived benefits from the Italian Governments investment incentive program for under-industrialized regions in Southern Italy, which includes the area that serves as the center of the Groups operations. The investment incentive program provided tax benefits, capital grants and subsidized loans. In particular, a substantial portion of the Groups earnings before taxes and minority interests from 1994 to 2003 was derived from Group companies to some extent from such tax exemptions. These tax exemptions expired between 1996 and 2003. The last tax exemption was related to the subsidiary Style & Comfort S.r.l. and expired on December 27, 2003. In December 1996, the Company and the Contract Planning Service of the Italian Ministry of Industrial Activities signed a Program Agreement with respect to the Natuzzi 2000 project. In connection with this project, the Group prepared a multi-faceted program of industrial investments for the increase of the production capacity of leather and fabric upholstered furniture in the area close to its headquarters in Italy. According to this Program Agreement, the Company should have made investments for  295.2 million and at the same time the Italian government should have contributed in the form of capital grants for  145.5 million. During 2003 the Company revised its growth and production strategy due to the strong competition from competitors in countries like China and Brazil. Therefore, as a consequence of this change in the economic environment in 2003, the Company requested to the Italian Ministry of Industrial Activities the revision of the original Program Agreement as follows: reduction of the investment to be made from  295.2 million to  69.8 million, and reduction of the related capital grants from  145.5 million to  35.0 million. In April 2005, the Company received from the Italian Government the final approval of the Program Agreement confirming these revisions. The Company received under the aforementioned project capital grants for  24.2 million. A committee has been appointed by the Ministry of Industrial Activities to prepare the final technical report for the disbursement of the remaining capital grants of approximately  10.8 million. 27 Table of Contents On April 27, 2004, the Technical-Scientific Committee of the Italian Education, University and Research Ministry approved a four-year research project presented by the Company in February 2002 related to improvement and development in leather manufacturing and processing. The Committee has approved a maximum capital grant of  2.4 million and a 10-year subsidized loan for a maximum amount of  3.3 million at a subsidized interest rate of 0.5% to be used in connection with industrial research expenses and prototype developments (as published on August 20, 2004, in the Italian Official Gazette (Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana) n° 195). Industrial research and prototype developments, planned as part of the project, are already underway thanks to the collaborative efforts of specialized in-house personnel and university researchers from the University of Lecce and the Polytechnic University of Bari. In February 2007, the Company provided the aforementioned Committee with the complete list of expenses to be acknowledged under such project and that have been incurred between August 19, 2002 through December 31, 2003 (such expenses amounted to  1.0 million). Also in 2007, the Company sent the list of all the costs incurred in 2004 and 2005, amounting to  1.1 million and  1.7 million respectively, to be acknowledged under the same project. In June 2008, the Italian Government provided a  2.0 million subsidized loan and a  1.5 million operating subsidy to the Company. In July 2008, the Company sent the final list of all the costs incurred in 2006 and 2007. In 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with the Italian Ministry of Industrial Activities for the incentive program denominated Integrated Package of BenefitsInnovation of the working national program Developing Local Entrepreneurs for the creation of a centralized information system in Santeramo in Colle that will be utilized by all Natuzzi points-of-sale around the world. This agreement acknowledges costs of  7.2 million and  1.9 million for the development and industrialization program, respectively. On March 20, 2006, the Italian Industrial Ministry issued a concession decree providing for a provisional grant to the Company of  2.8 million and a loan of  4.3 million, to be repaid at a rate of 0.74% over 10 years. In December 2006, the Company provided the aforementioned Committee with the list of expenses to be acknowledged under such project and that have been incurred between July 2005 through December 31, 2006 (such expenses amounted to  4.1 million). Additionally, in February 2008 and September 2008, the Company sent the list of all the remaining expenses incurred up to November 2007 (date of completion of the program) amounting to  6.7 million. In April 2009, the Italian Government provided a  3.9 million subsidized loan and a  1.9 million operating subsidy to the Company. During 2008, the Italian Ministry of Industrial Activities approved a new incentive program, entitled Made in Italy  Industry 2015. The objective of this program is to facilitate the realization and development of new production technologies and services with high innovation value in order to stimulate awareness for products that are made in Italy. In December 2008, the Company submitted to the Italian Ministry of Industrial Activities its proposal, entitled i-sofas, which is pending approval. The i-sofas program envisions a total investment of  3.9 million, up to  1.7 million of which may be contributed as a grant by the Italian Ministry of Industrial Activities. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will receive any such grants. 28 Table of Contents In November 2008, the Puglia regional authorities launched an incentive program in order to support companies located in the Puglia regional district that intend to invest in new production process changes, production diversification and industrial research. In January 2009, the Company submitted its proposal, entitled UthinkLean, which is pending to approval. The UThinkLean program envisions a total investment of  11.3 million, up to  3.7 million of which may be contributed as a grant by the Puglia regional authorities. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will receive any such grants. Certain of the Groups foreign subsidiaries, including Italsofa (Shanghai) Co. Ltd, Italsofa Bahia Ltda, Minuano Nordeste S.A. and SC Italsofa Romania S.r.l. enjoy significant tax benefits, such as corporate income tax exemptions or reductions of the applicable corporate income tax rates. Management of Exchange Rate Risk The Group is subject to currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of its business to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which it earns revenues. Exchange rate fluctuations also affect the Groups operating results because it recognizes revenues and costs in currencies other than euro but publishes its financial statements in euro. The Groups sales and results may be materially affected by exchange rate fluctuations. For more information, see Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Trademarks and Patents The Groups products are sold under the Natuzzi and Italsofa trademarks. These trademarks and certain other trademarks, such as Divani & Divani by Natuzzi, have been registered as such in Italy, the European Union, the United States and elsewhere. In order to protect its investments in new product development, the Group has also undertaken a practice of registering certain new designs in most of the countries in which such designs are sold. The Group currently has more than 1,500 design patents and patents pending. Applications are made with respect to new product introductions that the Group believes will enjoy commercial success and have a high likelihood of being copied. Regulation The Company is incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy. The principal laws and regulations that apply to the operations of the Companythose of Italy and the European Unionare different from those of the United States. Such non-U.S. laws and regulations may be subject to varying interpretations or may be changed, and new laws and regulations may be adopted, from time to time. While management believes that the Group is currently in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations (including Italian Legislative Decree No. 6 of 2003 and rules with respect to environmental matters), there can be no assurance that any subsequent official interpretation of such laws or regulations by the relevant governmental authorities that differs from that of the Company, or any such change or adoption, would not have an adverse effect on the results of operations of the Group or the rights of holders of the Ordinary Shares or the owners of the Companys ADSs.
