RISK FACTORS A number of factors (risk factors) affect Prudential's operating results, financial condition and trading price. The risk factors mentioned below should not be regarded as a complete and comprehensive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The information given is as of the date of this report, is not updated, and any forward-looking statements are made subject to the reservations specified below under "Forward-Looking Statements". Prudential's businesses are inherently subject to market fluctuations and general economic conditions. Prudential's businesses are inherently subject to market fluctuations and general economic conditions. In the UK, this is because a significant part of Prudential's shareholders' profit is related to bonuses for policyholders declared on its with-profits products, which are broadly based on historic and current rates of return on equity, real estate and fixed income securities, as well as Prudential's expectations of future investment returns. In the US, fluctuations in prevailing interest rates can affect results from Jackson National Life ('JNL') which is predominantly a spread-based business with the majority of its assets invested in fixed income securities. In particular, fixed annuities and stable value products in JNL expose the Group to the risk that changes in interest rates which are not fully reflected in the interest rates credited to customers will reduce spread. The spread is the difference between the amounts that JNL is required to pay under the contracts and the rate of return it is able to earn on its general account investments to support the obligations under the contracts. Declines in spread from these products or other spread businesses that JNL conducts could have a material impact on its businesses or results of operations. For some non unit-linked investment products, in particular those written in some of the Group's Asian operations, it may not be possible to hold assets which will provide cash flows to exactly match those relating to policyholder liabilities. This is particularly true in those countries where bond markets are not developed and in certain markets such as Taiwan where regulated surrender values are set with reference to the interest rate environment prevailing at time of policy issue. This is due to the duration and uncertainty of the liability cash flows and the lack of sufficient assets of a suitable duration. This results in a residual asset/liability mismatch risk which can be managed but not eliminated. If interest rates in these markets were to remain lower than surrender values over a sustained period this could have an adverse impact on the Group's reported profit. In all markets in which Prudential operates, its businesses are susceptible to general economic conditions and changes in investment returns which can change the level of demand for Prudential's products. Past uncertain trends in international economic and investment climates which have adversely affected Prudential's business and profitability could be repeated. This adverse effect would be felt principally through reduced investment returns and credit defaults. In addition, falling investment returns could impair Prudential's operational capability, including its ability to write significant volumes of new business. Prudential in the normal course of business enters into a variety of transactions, including derivative transactions with counterparties. Failure of any of these counterparties, particularly in conditions of major market disruption, to discharge their obligations, or where adequate collateral is not in place, could have an adverse impact on Prudential's results. Prudential is subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations owing to the geographical diversity of its businesses. Due to the geographical diversity of Prudential's businesses, it is subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Prudential's international operations in the US and Asia, which represent a significant proportion of operating profit and shareholders' funds, generally write policies and invest in assets denominated in local currency. Although this practice limits the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on 5 local operating results, it can lead to significant fluctuations in Prudential's consolidated financial statements upon translation of results into pounds sterling. The currency exposure relating to the translation of reported earnings is not separately managed. Consequently, this could impact on the Group's gearing ratios (defined as debt over debt plus shareholders' funds). The impact of gains or losses on currency translations is recorded as a component of shareholders' funds within the statement of changes in equity. Prudential conducts its businesses subject to regulation and associated regulatory risks, including the effects of changes in the laws, regulations, policies and interpretations and any accounting standards in the markets in which it operates. Changes in government policy, legislation or regulatory interpretation applying to companies in the financial services and insurance industries in any of the markets in which Prudential operates, which in some circumstances may be applied retrospectively, may adversely affect Prudential's product range, distribution channels, capital requirements and, consequently, reported results and financing requirements. For instance, regulators in jurisdictions in which Prudential operates may change the level of capital required to be held by individual businesses. Also these changes could include possible changes in the regulatory framework for pension arrangements and policies, the regulation of selling practices and solvency requirements. In the UK, the Financial Services Authority's (FSA) depolarization reforms, implemented in December 2004, under which the sales agent is no longer required to either be tied to a specific product provider or to recommend products from the whole spectrum of product providers in the market, and the rules relating to stakeholder products could have a significant effect on types of products sold by Prudential, how its products are priced, distributed and sold and on shareholders' return on with-profits business. Similar changes in regulation in other jurisdictions could also have an impact elsewhere in the Group. The EU Financial Conglomerates Directive (FCD) requires European financial services groups to demonstrate net aggregate surplus capital in excess of solvency requirements at the Group level in respect of shareholder-owned entities. The test is a continuous requirement so that Prudential needs to maintain a somewhat higher amount of regulatory capital at the Group level than otherwise necessary in respect of some of its individual businesses to accommodate, for example, short-term movements in global foreign exchange rates, interest rates, deterioration in credit quality and equity markets. In addition, changes in the local regulatory regimes of designated territories could affect the calculation of the Group's solvency position under the FCD. The EU is also currently reviewing future solvency requirements (Solvency II) with a directive expected during 2007 for implementation by member states. Inconsistent application of these directives by regulators in different EU member states may place Prudential at a competitive disadvantage to other European financial services groups. Various jurisdictions in which Prudential operates have created investor compensation schemes that require mandatory contributions from market participants in some instances in the event of a failure of a market participant. As a major participant in the majority of its chosen markets, circumstances could arise where Prudential, along with other companies, may be required to make such contributions. See Item 5 "Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsFactors Affecting Results of OperationsGovernment Policy and Legislation" and Item 4 "Information on the CompanySupervision and Regulation of Prudential". Any further changes or modification of the recently introduced International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounting policies and European Embedded Value (EEV) guidance may require a change in the reporting basis of future results or a restatement of reported results. 6 The resolution of several issues affecting the financial services industry could have a negative impact on Prudential's reported results or on its relations with current and potential customers. Prudential is, and in the future may be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of its business, both in the UK and internationally. This could be a review of business sold in the past under previously acceptable market practices at the time. Pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings relating to aspects of Prudential's business and operations which are typical of the business it operates in such as the requirement in the UK to provide redress to certain past purchasers of pension and mortgage endowment policies and regulatory reviews on products sold and industry practices, including in the latter case businesses it has closed. In the US, federal and state regulators have focused on, and continue to devote substantial attention to, the mutual fund, variable annuity and insurance product industries including new federal regulations in respect of broker-dealers. As a result of publicity relating to widespread perceptions of industry abuses, there have been numerous regulatory inquiries and proposals for legislative and regulatory reforms. Although Prudential believes it has adequately reserved in all material aspects for the costs of litigation and regulatory matters, no assurance can be provided that such reserves are sufficient. It is possible that Prudential's future performance could be affected by an unfavourable outcome in these matters. Prudential's businesses are conducted in highly competitive environments with developing demographic trends and Prudential's continued profitability depends on its management's ability to respond to these pressures and trends. The markets for the UK, US and Asian financial services are highly competitive, with several factors affecting Prudential's ability to sell its products and continued profitability, including price and yields offered, financial strength and ratings, range of product lines and product quality, brand strength and name recognition, investment management performance, historical bonus levels, developing demographic trends and customer appetite for certain savings products. In some of its markets Prudential faces competitors that are larger, have greater financial resources or a greater market share, offer a broader range of products or have higher bonus rates or claims-paying ratios. Further, heightened competition for talented and skilled employees with local experience, particularly in Asia, may limit the Group's potential to grow its business as quickly as planned. Within the UK, Prudential's principal competitors in the life market include many of the major stock and mutual retail financial services companies including, in particular, Aviva, Legal & General, HBOS and Standard Life. JNL's competitors in the US include major stock and mutual insurance companies, mutual fund organisations, banks and other financial services companies. JNL's principal life insurance company competitors in the US include AIG, Allstate Financial, Allianz Life of North America, AXA Financial Inc, Hartford Life Inc., ING, John Hancock, Lincoln Financial Group, Met Life, Pacific Life and Prudential Financial. Within Asia, the Group's main regional competitors are international financial companies, including AIG, Allianz, ING and Manulife. Prudential believes competition will intensify across all regions in response to consumer demand, technological advances, the impact of consolidation, regulatory actions and other factors. Prudential's ability to generate an appropriate return depends significantly upon its capacity to anticipate and respond appropriately to these competitive pressures. See Item 4, "Information on the CompanyBusiness of PrudentialCompetition". 7 Downgrades in Prudential's financial strength and credit ratings could significantly impact its competitive position and hurt its relationships with creditors or trading counterparties. Prudential's financial strength and credit ratings, which are intended to measure its ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of Prudential's products, and as a result its competitiveness. Downgrades in Prudential's ratings could have an adverse effect on its ability to market products and retain current policyholders. In addition, the interest rates Prudential pays on its borrowings are affected by its debt credit ratings, which are in place to measure Prudential's ability to meet its contractual obligations. Prudential believes the credit rating downgrades it experienced in 2002 and 2003, together with the rest of the UK insurance industry, have not to date had a discernible impact on the performance of its business. On June 23, 2006, Standard & Poor's announced that it had lowered its counterparty credit ratings on Prudential's long-term senior debt from AA- (negative outlook) to A+ (stable outlook). At the same time Standard & Poor's revised its outlook on Jackson National Life from AA (negative outlook) to AA (stable outlook). Prudential's long-term senior debt is currently rated as A2 (stable outlook) by Moody's, A+ (stable outlook) by Standard & Poor's and AA- (stable outlook) by Fitch. Prudential's short-term debt is rated as P-1 by Moody's, A1+ by Standard & Poor's and F1+ by Fitch. The PAC long-term fund is rated Aa1 (stable outlook) by Moody's, AA+ (stable outlook) by Standard & Poor's and AA+ by Fitch. Adverse experience in the operational risks inherent in Prudential's business could have a negative impact on its results of operations. Operational risks are present in all of Prudential's businesses, including the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal and external processes, systems and human error or from external events. Prudential's business is dependent on processing a large number of complex transactions across numerous and diverse products, and is subject to a number of different legal and regulatory regimes. In addition, Prudential outsources several operations, including certain UK processing and IT functions. In turn, Prudential is reliant upon the operational processing performance of its outsourcing partners. Further, because of the long-term nature of much of Prudential's business, accurate records have to be maintained for significant periods. Prudential's systems and processes are designed to ensure that the operational risks associated with its activities are appropriately controlled but, for example, any weakness in the administration systems or actuarial reserving processes could have an impact on its results of operations during the effective period. Prudential has not experienced or identified any operational risks in its systems or processes during 2005, or which have subsequently caused, or are expected to cause, a significant negative impact on its results of operations. Adverse experience against the assumptions used in pricing products and reporting business results could significantly affect Prudential's results of operations. Prudential needs to make assumptions about a number of factors in determining the pricing of its products and for reporting the results of its long-term business operations. For example, the assumption that Prudential makes about future expected levels of mortality is particularly relevant for its UK annuity business. In exchange for a premium equal to the capital value of their accumulated pension fund, pension annuity policyholders receive a guaranteed payment, usually monthly, for as long as they are alive. As part of its pension annuity pricing and reserving policy, 8 Prudential assumes that current rates of mortality continuously improve over time. During the year, Prudential carried out a review of its mortality experience across all of its non-profit annuity business. As a result of this review, it strengthened the realistic and statutory male assumptions and weakened the realistic female assumptions to align the realistic assumptions with recent experience. Prudential continues to assume future improvements in mortality for males and females at levels projected on the Continuous Mortality Investigations (CMI) medium cohort table as published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. If mortality improvement rates significantly exceed the improvement assumed, Prudential's results of operations could be adversely affected. A further example is the assumption that Prudential makes about future expected levels of the rates of early termination of products by its customers (persistency). This is particularly relevant to its lines of business other than its UK annuity business. Prudential's persistency assumptions reflect recent past experience for each relevant line of business. Any expected deterioration in future persistency is also reflected in the assumption. If actual levels of future persistency are significantly lower than assumed (that is, policy termination rates are significantly higher than assumed), Prudential's results of operations could be adversely affected. In common with other industry participants, the profitability of the Group's businesses depends on a mix of factors including mortality and morbidity trends, policy surrender rates, investment performance, unit cost of administration and new business acquisition expense. As a holding company, Prudential is dependent upon its subsidiaries to cover operating expenses and dividend payments. Prudential's insurance and investment management operations are generally conducted through direct and indirect subsidiaries. As a holding company, Prudential's principal sources of funds are dividends from subsidiaries, shareholder-backed funds, the shareholder transfer from Prudential's long-term funds and any amounts that may be raised through the issuance of equity, debt and commercial paper. Certain of the subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions that can limit the payment of dividends, which in some circumstances could limit the Group's ability to pay dividends to shareholders. Prudential operates in a number of markets through joint ventures and other arrangements with third parties. These arrangements involve certain risks that Prudential does not face with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries. Prudential operates, and in certain markets is required by local regulation to operate, through joint ventures. Prudential's ability to exercise management control over its joint venture operations and its investment in them depends on the terms of the joint venture agreements, in particular, the allocation of control among, and continued co-operation between, the joint venture participants. Prudential may also face financial or other exposure in the event that any of its joint venture partners fails to meet its obligations under the joint venture or encounters financial difficulty. In addition, a significant proportion of the Group's product distribution is carried out through arrangements with third parties not controlled by Prudential and is dependent upon continuation of these relationships. A temporary or permanent disruption to these distribution arrangements could affect Prudential's results of operations. 9 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This annual report may contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to certain of Prudential's plans and its current goals and expectations relating to its future financial condition, performance, results, strategy and objectives. Statements containing the words "believes", "intends", "expects", "plans", "seeks" and "anticipates", and words of similar meaning, are forward-looking. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances which are beyond Prudential's control including among other things, economic and business conditions in the countries in which Prudential operates, market related risks such as fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates, and the performance of financial markets generally; the policies and actions of regulatory authorities, the impact of competition, inflation, and deflation; experience in particular with regard to mortality and morbidity trends, lapse rates and policy renewal rates; the timing, impact and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or combinations within relevant industries; and the impact of changes in capital, solvency or accounting standards, and tax and other legislation and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Prudential and its affiliates operate, together with other factors discussed in "Risk Factors". This may for example result in changes to assumptions used for determining results of operations or re-estimations of reserves for future policy benefits. As a result, Prudential's actual future financial condition, performance and results may differ materially from the plans, goals, and expectations set forth in Prudential's forward-looking statements. In particular, the following are forward-looking in nature: certain statements in Item 4, "Information on the Company" with regard to strategy and management objectives, trends in market shares, prices, market standing and product volumes and the effects of changes or prospective changes in regulation, and certain statements in Item 5, "Operating and Financial Review and Prospects" with regard to trends in results, prices, volumes, operations, margins, overall market trends, risk management and exchange rates and with regard to the effects of changes or prospective changes in regulation. Prudential may also make or disclose written and/or oral forward-looking statements in reports filed or furnished to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Prudential's annual report and accounts to shareholders, proxy statements, offering circulars, registration statements and prospectuses, press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by directors, officers or employees of Prudential to third parties, including financial analysts. Prudential undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report or any other forward-looking statements it may make.
