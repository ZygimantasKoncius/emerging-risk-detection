RISK FACTORS Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before you invest in our securities, you should understand and carefully consider the risks below, as well as all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our securities may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. If we are unable to access external sources of financing we may not be able to fund and grow our operations. We depend on loans from our $22.5 million credit facility, our cash flow from operations and other external sources, to fund and expand our operations. Our ability to grow our business is dependent on availability under our credit facility and our access to additional financing and capital resources at acceptable rates. The failure to obtain financing and capital on acceptable financing terms as needed could limit our ability to purchase consumer receivable portfolios and achieve our growth plans. We have a $22.5 million credit facility with Wells Fargo, which expires in January 2011. As of April 10, 2009, we had approximately $14,100,000 million of credit available. However, many financial institutions have been adversely impacted by the current financial crisis and, as a result, have ceased or reduced the amount of lending they have made available to their customers. As a result, we may have insufficient credit lines available to purchase additional receivables, unless we successfully obtain additional credit. We have also raised additional capital from time to time through private placement offerings, or public offerings of equity or debt securities, or a combination thereof. Although we have no specific capital raising transactions currently under negotiation, we may determine to undertake such transactions at any time. Such transactions could include the sale of equity or debt at less than the market price of our common stock at the time of such transaction. The terms of any such capital raising transaction would be considered by the board of directors at the time it is proposed by management. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon the prevailing capital market conditions, as well as our business performance. We may be unable to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us or at all. If additional financing is raised by the issuance of common stock you may suffer additional dilution and if additional financing is raised through debt financing, it may involve significant restrictive covenants which could affect our ability to operate our business. In addition, we may incur significant costs in connection with any potential financing, whether or not we are able to raise additional capital. We may not be able to purchase consumer receivable portfolios at favorable prices or on sufficiently favorable terms or at all. Our ability to execute our business strategy depends upon the continued availability of consumer receivable portfolios that meet our purchasing criteria and our ability to identify and finance the purchases of such assets. The availability of consumer receivable portfolios at favorable prices and on terms acceptable to us depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including: • the continuation of the current growth trend in debt; • the continued volume of consumer receivable portfolios available for sale; • competitive factors affecting potential purchasers and sellers of consumer receivable portfolios; and • fluctuations in interest rates. The market for acquiring consumer receivable portfolios is becoming more competitive, thereby possibly diminishing our ability to acquire such portfolios at attractive prices in future periods. The growth in debt may also be affected by: 13 • a continued slowdown in the economy; • continued reductions in consumer spending; • changes in the underwriting criteria by originators; • changes in laws and regulations governing lending and bankruptcy; and • fluctuation in interest rates. The continued slowing of growth in consumer spending could result in a decrease in the availability for purchase of consumer receivable portfolios that could affect the purchase prices of such portfolios. Any increase in the prices we are required to pay for such assets in turn will reduce the possible profit, if any, we generate from such assets. We may not be able to recover sufficient amounts from the assets we acquire to recover the costs associated with the purchase and servicing of those assets and to fund our operations. We acquire and collect on charged-off consumer receivable portfolios. In order to operate profitably over the long term, we must continually purchase and collect on a sufficient volume of receivables to generate revenue that exceeds our costs. Our inability to realize value from our receivable portfolios in excess of the purchase price paid for such receivables and our expenses may compromise our ability to remain as a going concern. The originators or interim owners of the receivables generally have: • made numerous attempts to collect on these obligations, often using both their in-house collection staff and third-party collection agencies; • subsequently deemed these obligations as uncollectible; and • charged-off these obligations. These receivable portfolios are purchased at significant discounts to the actual amounts the obligors owe. These receivables are difficult to collect and actual recoveries may vary and be less than the amount expected. In addition, our collections may worsen in a weak economic cycle, such as the cycle we are currently experiencing in the United States. In addition, as the unemployment rate increases, we may also experience lower recovery rates. As a result, we may not recover amounts in excess of our acquisition and servicing costs. Since 2003, we have purchased approximately $501 million in original face amount of consumer receivables at a purchase price of approximately $40.7 million. Such original outstanding amount does not include interest and other fees which are accrued by the originator subsequent to the time of charge-off. We have collected approximately $54.5 million of such consumer receivables, which includes interest accrued post charge-off. As of December 31, 2008, we have approximately $669 million in current face amount of consumer receivables, which includes interest accrued post charge-off and excludes uncollectible accounts, such as deceased and bankrupt accounts. For the reasons set forth herein and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we cannot estimate what percentage of the current face amount of consumer receivables we will actually collect. Our ability to recover on our consumer receivable portfolios and produce sufficient returns can also be negatively impacted by the quality of the purchased receivables. In the normal course of our portfolio acquisitions, some receivables may be included in the portfolios that fail to conform to certain terms of the purchase agreements and we may seek to return these receivables to the seller for payment or replacement receivables. However, such sellers may not be able to meet their payment obligations to us. In addition, in order to obtain a portfolio of receivables, we may be required to purchase certain receivables that do not meet our general purchase criteria. Accounts that we are unable to return to sellers or that do not meet our general purchase criteria may yield no return. If cash flows from operations are less than anticipated as a result of our inability to collect sufficient amounts on our receivables, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, purchase new portfolios and our future growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected. 14 We are subject to intense competition for the purchase of distressed assets that may affect our ability to purchase distressed assets at acceptable prices or at all. We compete with other purchasers of consumer receivable portfolios, with third-party collection agencies and with financial services companies that manage their own portfolios. We compete on the basis of reputation, industry experience and performance. Some of our competitors have greater capital, personnel and other resources than we have. The possible entry of new competitors, including competitors that historically have focused on the acquisition of different asset types, and the expected increase in competition from current market participants, may reduce our access to consumer receivable portfolios. Aggressive pricing by our competitors could raise the price of such distressed assets above levels that we are willing to pay, which could reduce the amount of such assets suitable for us to purchase or, if purchased by us, reduce the profits, if any, generated by such assets. If we are unable to purchase distressed assets at favorable prices or at all, our revenues and our ability to cover operating expenses may be negatively impacted and our earnings could be materially reduced. We are dependent upon third parties, including affiliates of our officers and directors, to service the legal collection process of our consumer receivable portfolios. We outsource substantially all of our receivable servicing to over 80 law firms throughout the United States. As a result, we are dependent upon the efforts of our third party servicers, including the law firm of Ragan & Ragan, P.C., to service and collect our consumer receivables. Any failure by our third party servicers to adequately perform collection services for us or remit such collections to us could materially reduce our revenues and possibly our profitability. In addition, our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to secure replacement servicers. Conflicts of interest may occur as a result of W. Peter Ragan, Sr. serving as a director and officer of our company, and W. Peter Ragan, Jr., serving as an officer of our company, while also being the principals of Ragan & Ragan, P.C., our third party servicers in the State of New Jersey. As officers and, in the case of W. Peter Ragan, Sr., also as a director, of our company, Messrs. Ragan and Ragan have a fiduciary duty to our stockholders. However, their position as the principals of the law firm Ragan & Ragan, P.C., the primary third party servicers of our consumer receivable portfolios in the State of New Jersey, may compromise their ability to make decisions in the best interests of our stockholders. Each of Messrs. Ragan and Ragan devotes approximately 50% of his business time to our affairs in accordance with the terms of his respective employment agreement and the balance of his business time to his law practice which includes the representation of companies that may be deemed our competitors. Accordingly, there are potential conflicts of interest inherent in such relationship. The current agreement by and between our wholly-owned subsidiary, Velocity Investments (“VI”), and Ragan & Ragan P.C. is for one calendar year, and automatically extends for additional periods of one calendar year each unless terminated by us. The agreement provides for the payment to such firm of a contingency fee equal to 25% of all amounts collected and paid by the obligors. The shareholders of Ragan & Ragan, P.C. are W. Peter Ragan, Sr., our vice president and a director, and W. Peter Ragan Jr., president of our wholly-owned subsidiary, VI. During 2008 and 2007, we paid Ragan & Ragan, P.C. an aggregate of $800,261 and $1,134,345 respectively, for services rendered in accordance with the terms of the agreements between our subsidiaries and Ragan & Ragan, P.C. Pursuant to an employment agreement dated January 1, 2004, by and between W. Peter Ragan, Sr. and us, Mr. Ragan, Sr. is entitled to an annual salary of $100,000 in consideration for his position as our Vice President and president of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, J. Holder, Inc. (“J. Holder”) and VOM, LLC (“VOM”). In addition, pursuant to an employment agreement dated January 1, 2004, by and between W. Peter Ragan, Jr. and us, Mr. Ragan, Jr. is entitled to an annual salary of $100,000 per year in consideration for his position as president of our wholly-owned subsidiary, VI. Each agreement has been extended automatically pursuant to its terms. Each of Messrs. Ragan and Ragan beneficially own approximately 13.10% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of April 10, 2009. The loss of any of our executive officers may adversely affect our operations and our ability to successfully acquire distressed assets. John C. Kleinert, our president and chief executive officer, W. Peter Ragan, Sr., our vice president, W. Peter Ragan, Jr., president of our wholly-owned subsidiary, VI, and Mr. James J. Mastriani, our chief financial officer, chief legal officer, treasurer and secretary, are responsible for making substantially all management decisions, including determining which distressed assets to purchase, the purchase price and other material terms of such acquisitions and when to sell such portfolios. Although we have entered into employment agreements with each of such individuals, the loss of any of their services could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our ability to successfully acquire consumer receivable portfolios. In addition, we have not obtained “key man” life insurance on the lives of Mr. Kleinert, Mr. Ragan, Sr., Mr. Ragan, Jr. and Mr. Mastriani. 15 We may incur substantial indebtedness from time to time in connection with our operations. As of December 31, 2008, we had $16.6 million of debt outstanding, including borrowings under our $22.5 million credit facility and our outstanding notes, $4.4 million of which related to discontinued operations. On October 29, 2008, we issued an additional $360,000 principal amount of debt. We may incur substantial additional debt from time to time in connection with our purchase of consumer receivable portfolios which could affect our ability to obtain additional funds and may increase our vulnerability to economic downturns. In particular, • we could be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs and, as a result, we would have less funds available for operations, future acquisitions of consumer receivable portfolios and other purposes; • it may be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional funding through financings, if available at all; • we would be more vulnerable to economic downturns and fluctuations in interest rates, less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in reacting to changes in our industry and general economic conditions; and • if we defaulted under our existing senior credit facility or other outstanding indebtedness or if our lenders demanded payment of a portion or all of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments. Some of our debt relates to discontinued operations, and we may not be able to satisfy such debt obligations solely by liquidating the related assets. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $4.4 million in outstanding debt related to the discontinued operations of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, J. Holder and VOM. Such debt consists of an outstanding balance on a line of credit and notes, including $2.3 million principal amount of notes held by related parties. As of December 31, 2008, we valued the assets attributable to the discontinued operations at $5.8 million, $4.4 million of which is attributable to properties held for sale. Due to the current economic crisis and real estate market downturn, we may be forced to accept less for such assets upon liquidation or incur additional impairment charges. Accordingly, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations related to our discontinued operations solely by liquidating the related assets. We have pledged all of our assets to secure our borrowings under our credit facility and if we default under our credit facility, our operations would be seriously harmed. Any indebtedness that we incur under our credit facility is secured by a first lien upon all of our assets, including all of our portfolios of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation. If we default under our credit facility, those assets would be available to our lender to satisfy our obligations. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our ability to acquire consumer receivable portfolios and operate our business. As a result of our failure to satisfy certain covenants under our credit facility with Wells Fargo, our auditors have expressed doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of a revision of our expected estimated cash collection forecast methodology by extending the collection forecast useful life of our pools from 60 months to 84 months and adjusting the timing of expected future collections, and the resulting impairment charge, as of December 31, 2008, we did not satisfy the minimum stockholders equity covenant required by our Credit Facility. In addition, we and VI each failed to satisfy the minimum net income covenant under the Credit Facility for the 4th quarter. We are currently working closely with the Lender on obtaining a waiver of the breach of these December 31, 2008 covenants and amending the Credit Facility to restructure these covenants. While we anticipate completion of this waiver and amendment to the Credit Facility by May 2009, Wells Fargo is not obligated to waive these covenants. If we are unable to obtain a waiver and amendment of the Credit Facility, Wells Fargo could exercise certain remedies under the Loan Agreement, including but not limited to foreclosure on the loan. As a result of these failures, our auditors report for our 2008 financial statements, which are included in this Report, contains a statement concerning our ability to continue as a going concern. Our lack of sufficient liquidity without the Credit Facility could make it more difficult for us to secure additional financing or enter into strategic relationships on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and may materially and adversely affect the terms of any financing that we may obtain and our public stock price generally. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, our negotiations with Wells Fargo to amend the covenants contained in our Credit Facility to reflect our revised forecasting methodology, as well as the current economic conditions. However, we may be unable to renegotiate these covenants and therefore may be unable to continue as a going concern if they should foreclose. 16 The restrictions contained in the secured financings could negatively impact our ability to obtain financing from other sources and to operate our business. We and our subsidiaries have agreed to maintain certain ratios with respect to borrowings under our credit facility against the estimated remaining return value on Wells Fargo financed portfolios. Our VI subsidiary agreed to maintain a minimum net worth and subordinated debt of at least $14,000,000 for the duration of the facility and net income of $375,000 for each calendar quarter. We have also agreed to maintain minimum net worth of at least $25,000,000 in stockholders’ equity and subordinated debt for the duration of the facility and net income of at least $200,000 for each calendar quarter. Therefore, our ability to obtain financing from other sources may be limited in the future. Our credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that may restrict our ability to operate our business. Furthermore, the failure to satisfy any of these covenants could: • cause our indebtedness to become immediately payable; • preclude us from further borrowings from these existing sources; and • prevent us from securing alternative sources of financing necessary to purchase consumer receivable portfolios and to operate our business. The result of such failure to satisfy these covenants would significantly impact our ability to operate our business and cause our credit facility to become immediately due and payable, and give Wells Fargo the right to foreclose on our assets. We anticipate that we will incur significant increases in interest expenses in the future. As a result of our increased borrowings under our line of credit and our other outstanding debt, we anticipate that we will incur significant increases in interest expense. We believe such increases will be offset over time by expected increased revenues from consumer receivable portfolios purchased utilizing the proceeds of these financings. However, revenues from such purchased portfolios may not exceed the additional interest expense. If the expected revenues from such purchased portfolios do not exceed such interest expenses, our results could be materially affected. Our collections may decrease if bankruptcy filings increase. During times of economic recession, the amount of defaulted consumer receivables generally increases, which contributes to an increase in the amount of personal bankruptcy filings. Under certain bankruptcy filings an obligor’s assets are sold to repay credit originators, but since certain of the receivables we purchase are unsecured, we often would not be able to collect on those receivables. We cannot assure you that our collection experience would not decline with an increase in bankruptcy filings. If our actual collection experience with respect to our unsecured receivable portfolios is significantly lower than we projected when we purchased the portfolios, our realization on those assets may decline and our earnings could be negatively affected. We may not be able to acquire consumer receivables of new asset types or implement a new pricing structure. We may pursue the acquisition of consumer receivable portfolios of asset types in which we have little current experience. We may not be able to complete any acquisitions of receivables of these asset types and our limited experience in these asset types may impair our ability to properly price these receivables or collect on these receivables. This may cause us to pay too much for these receivables, and consequently, we may not generate a profit from these receivable portfolio acquisitions. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to execute our business strategy. We have experienced rapid growth over the past several years and intend to maintain our growth. However, our growth will place demands on our resources and we cannot be sure that we will be able to manage our growth effectively. Future internal growth will depend on a number of factors, including: • the effective and timely initiation and development of relationships with sellers of distressed assets and strategic partners; • our ability to efficiently collect consumer receivables; and • the recruitment, motivation and retention of qualified personnel. 17 Sustaining growth will also require the implementation of enhancements to our operational and financial systems and will require additional management, operational and financial resources. We may not be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or maintain or accelerate our growth. Any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and control our expenses. Our operations could suffer from telecommunications or technology downtime, disruption or increased costs. Our ability to execute our business strategy depends in part on sophisticated telecommunications and computer systems. The temporary loss of our computer and telecommunications systems, through casualty, operating malfunction or servicer’s failure, could disrupt our operations. In addition, we must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to properly bid on prospective acquisitions of consumer receivable portfolios and to access, maintain and expand the databases we use for our collection and monitoring activities. Any failure of our information systems and their backup systems would interrupt our operations. We do not maintain business interruption insurance. However, we maintain a disaster recovery program intended to allow us to operate our business at an offsite facility. In the event our disaster recovery program fails to operate as expected or we do not have adequate backup arrangements for all of our operations, we may incur significant losses if an outage occurs. We use estimates for recognizing revenue on a majority of our consumer receivable portfolio investments and our earnings would be reduced if actual results are less than estimated. We recognize finance income on a majority of our consumer receivable portfolios using the interest method. We only use this method if we can reasonably estimate the expected amount and timing of cash to be collected on a specific portfolio based on historic experience and other factors. Under the interest method, we recognize finance income on the effective yield method based on cash flows and the portfolio’s carrying value prior to the application of the current quarter’s cash collections. At December 31, 2008, we have $37,592,364 in consumer receivables outstanding. The estimated future cash flows are reevaluated quarterly. If future cash collections on these portfolios were less than what was estimated, we would recognize an impairment expense that would reduce our earnings during such periods. Any reduction in our earnings could materially adversely affect our stock price. When we first developed our cash forecasting models in 2003, limited historical collection data was available to accurately estimate cash collections beyond 60 months. Since developing these models, we have continuously analyzed the historical collection data over the life of the portfolios. While we do not yet have six complete years of historical information on any of our static pools, we have observed that certain receivable portfolios purchased during, and prior to 2004, have experienced cash collections beyond 60 months from the date of purchase. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an impairment of approximately $8.36 million on our consumer receivable portfolios. This impairment was primarily due to a combination of an extension of the collection curve from 60 to 84 months and a shortfall in collections in certain pool groups against our forecast, primarily our 2005 and 2006 vintages. Risk Factors Relating to Our Industry Government regulations may limit our ability to recover and enforce the collection of our consumer receivables. Federal, state and municipal laws, rules, regulations and ordinances may limit our ability to recover and enforce our rights with respect to the consumer receivables acquired by us. These laws include, but are not limited to, the following Federal statutes and related regulations and comparable statutes in states where obligors reside and/or where creditors are located: • Fair Debt Collection Practices Act; • Fair Credit Reporting Act; • Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; • Electronic Funds Transfer Act; • Telephone Consumer Protection Act; • Servicemembers Civil Relief Act; • U.S. Bankruptcy Code; • Fair Credit Billing Act; and • the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 18 We may be precluded from collecting consumer receivables we purchase where the creditors or other previous owners or servicers failed to comply with applicable law in originating or servicing such acquired receivables. Laws relating to the collection of consumer debt also directly apply to our business. Our failure to comply with any laws applicable to us, including state licensing laws, could limit our ability to recover on our receivables and could subject us to fines and penalties, which could reduce our earnings and result in a default under our loan arrangements. In addition, while some financial services companies are eligible to receive funds from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, we are not. Therefore, to the extent the current economic crisis adversely affects our ability to collect upon troubled assets, we do not expect to receive government assistance. Additional laws may be enacted that could impose additional restrictions on the servicing and collection of consumer receivables. Such new laws may adversely affect the ability to collect on our receivables which could also adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Our inability to obtain or renew required licenses or to be qualified to do business in certain states could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition. We currently hold a number of licenses issued under applicable consumer credit laws. Certain of our current licenses and any licenses that we may be required to obtain in the future may be subject to periodic renewal provisions and/or other requirements. In addition, many states require companies to be qualified to do business in such states in order for such companies to be able to bring lawsuits in the courts of such states, and unqualified companies transacting business in a state are generally barred from maintaining a lawsuit in such state’s courts. If we are denied access to a state’s courts, we may not be able to bring an action to enforce collection of our receivables in that state. Our inability to renew our licenses or take any other required action with respect to such licenses or obtain or maintain qualifications to do business in certain states could limit our ability to collect on some of our receivables and otherwise have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition. Because our receivables are generally originated and serviced pursuant to a variety of federal and/or state laws by a variety of entities and may involve consumers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, it is difficult to detect whether the original servicing entities have at all times been in substantial compliance with applicable law. Also, while we have no knowledge of circumstances to the contrary, it is possible that we or our servicers have been or will continue to be at all times in substantial compliance with applicable law. The failure to comply with applicable law could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables and could subject us to increased costs, fines and penalties. Class action suits and other litigation in our industry could divert our management’s attention from operating our business and increase our expenses. Certain originators and servicers in the consumer credit industry have been subject to class actions and other litigation. Claims have included failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations and improper or deceptive origination and servicing practices. If we become a party to any such class action suit or other litigation, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 19 Risk Factors Relating to Our Securities Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may cause possible volatility in the price of our securities or cause the price to decline. Because of the nature of our business, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which may adversely affect the market price of our securities. Our results may fluctuate as a result of any of the following: • the timing and amount of collections on our consumer receivable portfolios; • our inability to identify and acquire additional consumer receivable portfolios; • a decline in the estimated value of our consumer receivable portfolio recoveries; • increases in operating expenses associated with the growth of our operations; and • general and economic market conditions. In addition, the overall market for securities in recent years generally, and in the last year particularly, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many smaller companies and companies operating in the financial sector. The trading price of our securities is expected to be subject to significant fluctuations including, but not limited to, the following: • quarterly variations in operating results and achievement of key business metrics; • changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts, if any; • any differences between reported results and securities analysts’ published or unpublished expectations; • announcements of new portfolio purchases by us or our competitors; • market reaction to any acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors; • shares being sold pursuant to Rule 144 or upon exercise of warrants or options or conversion of our outstanding preferred stock and convertible notes; and • general economic or stock market conditions unrelated to our operating performance. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may have a material or adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Because three stockholders own a large percentage of our voting stock, other stockholders’ voting power may be limited. As of April 10, 2009, John C. Kleinert, W. Peter Ragan, Sr. and W. Peter Ragan, Jr., three of our executive officers, beneficially owned or controlled approximately 65.73% (including shares issuable upon conversion of preferred stock owned by such stockholders) of our shares. If those stockholders act together, they may have the ability to influence matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and the approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, the ownership of such three stockholders could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us, and consequently, materially adversely affect the price of our common stock. These stockholders may make decisions that are adverse to your interests. 20 Our organizational documents, employment and change of control agreements and Delaware law make it more difficult for us to be acquired without the consent and cooperation of our board of directors and management. Provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of our common stock. In addition, our employment and change of control agreements with certain of our executive officers require lump sum payments and the immediate vesting of unvested stock grants and stock options upon a change of control. Under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such shares. The ability to issue shares of preferred stock could tend to discourage takeover or acquisition proposals not supported by our current board of directors. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires 15% or more of our common stock. Our outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of common stock. The sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares of common stock underlying our outstanding warrants could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future financing. If and to the extent these warrants are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings. The issuance of authorized shares of preferred stock and additional common stock may result in dilution to existing stockholders, adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders and depress the price of our common stock. We have 10,000,000 shares of authorized “blank check” preferred stock, the terms of which may be fixed by our board of directors. Our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to create and issue one or more series of such preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend and other rights of the holders of such preferred stock. Depending on the rights, preferences and privileges granted when the preferred stock is issued, it may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control without further action by the stockholders, may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and may adversely affect the market price of and voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. As of April 10, 2009, there were 1,380,000 shares of preferred stock outstanding, convertible into 276,000 shares of our common stock. In addition to the preferred stock, we are authorized to issue 40,000,000 shares of our common stock. As of April 10, 2009, there were 894,799 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. However, the total number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding does not include outstanding unexercised options, warrants, convertible preferred shares or convertible debt exercisable for 426,417 shares of common stock, which we have reserved as of April 10, 2009. We have reserved a total of 50,000 shares of common stock under our 2004 Equity Incentive Program. As of April 10, 2009, 12,600 shares had been issued under such plan. Under most circumstances, our board of directors has the right, without stockholder approval, to issue authorized but unissued and nonreserved shares of our common stock. If all of these shares were issued, it would dilute the existing stockholders and may depress the price of our common stock. Any of (i) the exercise of the outstanding options and warrants, (ii) the conversion of the preferred stock, or (iii) the conversion by the convertible debenture holder of such debenture into shares of our common stock will reduce the percentage of common stock held by the public stockholders. Further, the terms on which we could obtain additional capital during the life of the options and warrants may be adversely affected, and it should be expected that the holders of the options and the warrants would exercise them at a time when we would be able to obtain equity capital on terms more favorable than those provided for by such options and warrants. As a result, any issuance of additional shares of common stock may cause our current stockholders to suffer significant dilution and depress the price of our common stock. 21 Common stock eligible for future sale may depress the price of our common stock in the market. As of April 10, 2009, there were 894,799 shares of common stock held by our present stockholders, and approximately 712,386 shares may be available for public sale by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. 155,003 shares, 68,200 shares and 53,813 shares may be sold pursuant to current registration statements effective on August 12, 2005, December 29, 2005 and December 18, 2007, respectively. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, after satisfying a six month holding period: (i) affiliated stockholder (or stockholders whose shares are aggregated) may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three month period a number of securities which does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale and (ii) non-affiliated stockholders may sell without such limitations, provided we are current in our public reporting obligations. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities by non-affiliates that have satisfied a one year holding period without any limitation or restriction. The sale of such a large number of shares may cause the price of our securities to decline. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future; therefore, returns on your investment may only be realized by the appreciation in value of our securities, if any. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We plan to retain any future earnings to finance growth. Because of this, investors who purchase our common stock and/or convert their warrants into common stock may only realize a return on their investment if the value of our common stock appreciates. If we determine that we will pay dividends to the holders of our common stock, we may be unable to pay on a timely basis. Our securities may be de-listed from the NYSE Alternext if we do not meet continued listing requirements. If we do not meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE Alternext and our securities are delisted by the NYSE Alternext, trading of our securities would thereafter likely be conducted on the OTC Bulletin Board. In such case, the market liquidity for our securities would likely be negatively affected, which may make it more difficult for holders of our common stock and preferred stock to sell their securities in the open market and we could face difficulty raising capital necessary for our continued operations. The NYSE Alternext requires that in the event a listed security has been trading at a low price per share for a substantial period of time, the issuer must effect an appropriate reverse stock split. On November 17, 2008, we effected a one-for-twenty reverse split of our common stock in part to satisfy NYSE Alternext listing requirements. Nevertheless, our securities may in the future trade at levels that do not meet the NYSE Alternext requirements. 22 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None
