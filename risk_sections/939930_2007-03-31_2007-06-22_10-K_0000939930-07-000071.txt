ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) Risks Relating to the Tobacco Industry (Continued) We have been, and continue to be, subject to governmental investigations into, and litigation concerning, leaf tobacco industry buying practices. (Continued) In March 2004, we discovered potential irregularities with respect to certain bank accounts in southern Europe and central Asia. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors engaged an outside law firm to conduct an investigation of activity relating to these accounts. That investigation revealed that, although the amounts involved were not material and had no material impact on our historical financial statements, there were payments from these accounts that may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In May 2004, we voluntarily reported the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice. Soon thereafter, we closed the accounts in question, implemented personnel changes and other measures designed to prevent similar situations in the future, including the addition of new finance and internal audit staff and enhancement of existing training programs, and disclosed these circumstances in our filings with t he SEC. In August 2006, we learned that the SEC has issued a formal order of investigation of us and others to determine if these or other actions may have violated certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rules thereunder. We are cooperating fully with the SEC with respect to the investigation. If the U.S. authorities determine that there have been violations of federal laws, they may seek to impose sanctions on us that may include, among other things, injunctive relief, disgorgement, fines, penalties and modifications to business practices. It is not possible to predict at this time whether the authorities will determine that violations have occurred, and if they do, what sanctions they might seek to impose. It is also not possible to predict how the governmentÂ’s investigation or any resulting sanctions may impact our business, results of operations or financial performance. Any monetary penalty assessed may be material to our results of operations in the quarter in which it is im posed. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
