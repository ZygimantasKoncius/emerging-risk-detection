Risk Factors We face significant competition for users, advertisers, publishers and distributors, principally from Google, Microsoft, and AOL. We face significant competition from Google, Microsoft, and AOL, which each offer an integrated variety of Internet products, advertising services, technologies, online services and content in a manner similar to Yahoo!. Among other areas, we compete against these companies:  to attract and retain users;  to attract advertisers;  to attract third-party Website publishers to participate in our Affiliate network; and  to obtain agreements with software publishers, internet access providers, mobile carriers, device manufacturers and others to promote or distribute our services to their users. Google, Microsoft and AOL offer products and services that directly compete for users with our offerings, including consumer e-mail, desktop search, local search, instant messaging, photos, maps, video sharing, content channels, mobile applications, and shopping services. We also compete with traditional media companies to attract advertising dollars, both domestically and internationally. Currently many advertisers direct a portion, but only a portion, of their advertising budgets to Internet advertising. In response, traditional media companies are increasingly expanding their content offerings onto the Web and thus are competing not only to keep offline advertising dollars but also for a share of online advertising dollars. We further compete for users, advertisers and developers with the wide variety of other providers of online services, including social media and networking sites like Facebook and MySpace.com. In recent years, social networks and social media sites have attracted an increased share of users online time. Some of our existing competitors and possible additional entrants may have greater brand recognition for certain products and services, more expertise in a particular segment of the market, and greater operational, strategic, technological, financial, personnel, or other resources than we do. For example AOL, as a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc., may have access to content from Time Warners movie, television, music, book, periodical, news, sports, and other media holdings; access to a network of cable and other broadband users and delivery technologies; and advertising offerings. In addition, Google and Microsoft have access to considerable financial and technical resources with which to compete aggressively, including by funding future growth and expansion and investing in acquisitions and research and development. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, developers, or distributors, our revenues and growth rates could decline. In addition, competitors may consolidate with each other and new competitors may enter the market. The majority of our revenues are derived from marketing services, and the reduction in spending by or loss of current or potential advertisers would cause our revenues and operating results to decline. For the year ended December 31, 2008, 88 percent of our total revenues came from marketing services. Our ability to continue to retain and grow marketing services revenues depends upon:  maintaining and growing our user base;  maintaining and growing our popularity as an Internet destination site;  attracting more advertisers to our user base;  broadening our relationships with advertisers to small-and medium-sized businesses;  the successful implementation and acceptance of our advertising exchange by advertisers, website publishers, and online advertising networks; 11 Table of Contents  the successful implementation, acceptance and ongoing improvement of our new advertising management platform, APT from Yahoo!;  the successful implementation, acceptance and improvement of our search technologies;  maintaining and expanding our Affiliate program for search and display marketing services; and  deriving better demographic and other information about our users to enable us to offer better experiences to both our users and advertisers. In many cases, our agreements with advertisers have terms of one year or less, or, in the case of search marketing agreements, may be terminated at any time by the advertiser or Yahoo!. Search marketing agreements often have payments dependent upon usage or click-through levels. Accordingly, it is difficult to forecast marketing services revenues accurately. In addition, our expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues, including occasional guaranteed minimum payments to our Affiliates in connection with search and/or display advertising, and are fixed over the short-term in some categories. The state of the global economy and availability of capital has and could further impact the advertising spending patterns of existing and potential future advertisers. Any reduction in spending by, or loss of, existing or potential future advertisers would cause our revenues to decline. Further, we may be unable to adjust our expenses and capital expenditures quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Deterioration in general economic conditions has caused and could cause additional decreases or delays in marketing services spending by our advertisers and could harm our ability to generate marketing services revenues and our results of operations. Marketing services expenditures tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Since we derive most of our revenues from marketing services, the current deterioration in economic conditions has caused and could cause additional decreases in or delays in advertising spending and is likely to reduce our marketing services revenues and negatively impact our short term ability to grow our revenues. Further, any decreased collectability of accounts receivable or early termination of agreements due to the current deterioration in economic conditions could negatively impact our results of operations. If our cost reduction initiatives do not yield anticipated benefits or if we do not manage our operating expenses effectively, our profitability might decline. We have implemented cost reduction initiatives designed to better align our operating expenses with our revenues, including reducing our headcount, outsourcing some administrative functions, consolidating space and terminating leases or entering into subleases. We plan to continue to implement these initiatives and to manage costs to better and more efficiently manage our business. Our cost reduction initiatives, however, might not yield the anticipated benefits. Our operating expenses might also increase, from their reduced levels, as we expand our operations in areas of desired growth, continue to develop and extend the Yahoo! brand, fund product development, and acquire and integrate complementary businesses and technologies. In addition, deteriorating economic conditions or other factors could cause our business to contract requiring us to implement additional cost cutting measures. If we do not recognize the anticipated benefits of our cost reduction initiatives, our expenses increase at a greater pace than our revenues, or we fail to implement additional cost cutting if required in a timely manner, our profitability will decline. If we are unable to provide innovative search technologies and other services that generate significant traffic to our Websites, our business could be harmed, causing our revenues to decline. We deploy our own Internet search technology to provide search results on our network. Internet search is characterized by rapidly changing technology, significant competition, evolving industry standards, and frequent product and service enhancements. We must continually invest in improving our users experience, including search relevance, speed, and services responsive to users needs and preferences, to continue to attract, retain, 12 Table of Contents and expand our user base. If we are unable to provide innovative search technologies and other services which generate significant traffic to our Websites, our business could be harmed, causing our revenues to decline. We rely on the value of our brands, and a failure to maintain or enhance the Yahoo! brands in a cost-effective manner could harm our operating results. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands, including those that contain the Yahoo! name as well as those that do not, is an important aspect of our efforts to attract and expand our user, advertiser, and Affiliate base. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the Internet market. We have spent considerable money and resources to date on the establishment and maintenance of our brands, and we anticipate spending increasing amounts of money on, and devoting greater resources to, advertising, marketing, and other brand-building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands. Our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including among other issues: service outages; product malfunctions; data privacy and security issues; exploitation of our trademarks by others without permission; and poor presentation or integration of our search marketing listings by Affiliates on their sites or in their software and services. Further, while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by our licensees, our licensees might take actions that could impair the value of our brand, our proprietary rights, or the reputation of our products and media properties. If we are unable to maintain or enhance customer awareness of, and trust in, our brands in a cost-effective manner, or if we incur excessive expenses in these efforts, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any failure or inability to sufficiently protect them could harm our business and our operating results. We create, own, and maintain a wide array of intellectual property assets, including copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, and rights to certain domain names, which we believe are among our most valuable assets. We seek to protect our intellectual property assets through patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, and other laws of the U.S. and other countries of the world, and through contractual provisions. However, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights might not be sufficient or effective at stopping unauthorized use of those rights. Protection of the distinctive elements of Yahoo! might not always be available under copyright law or trademark law, or we might not discover or determine the full extent of any unauthorized use of our copyrights and trademarks in order to protect our rights. In addition, effective trademark, patent, copyright, and trade secret protection might not be available or cost-effective in every country in which our products and media properties are distributed or made available through the Internet. Further, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we might choose not to protect (or not to protect in some jurisdictions) certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is also a risk that the scope of protection under our patents may not be sufficient in some cases or that existing patents may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. With respect to maintaining our trade secrets, we have entered into confidentiality agreements with most of our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with many of the parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. However, these agreements might be breached and our trade secrets might be compromised by outside parties or by our employees, which could cause us to lose any competitive advantage provided by maintaining our trade secrets. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use, the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced. In addition, protecting our intellectual property and other proprietary rights is expensive and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and consequently harm our operating results. 13 Table of Contents We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property infringement or other third-party claims, which are costly to defend, could result in significant damage awards, and could limit our ability to provide certain content or use certain technologies in the future. Internet, technology, media companies, and patent holding companies often possess a significant number of patents. Further, many of these companies and other parties are actively developing or purchasing search, indexing, electronic commerce, and other Internet-related technologies, as well as a variety of online business models and methods. We believe that these parties will continue to take steps to protect these technologies, including, but not limited to, seeking patent protection. In addition, patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As a result, disputes regarding the ownership of technologies and rights associated with online business are likely to continue to arise in the future. From time to time, parties assert patent infringement claims against us. Currently, we are engaged in a number of lawsuits regarding patent issues and have been notified of a number of other potential disputes. In addition to patent claims, third-parties have asserted, and are likely in the future to assert, claims against us alleging infringement of copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights or other proprietary rights, or alleging unfair competition. In addition, third-parties have made, and may continue to make, trademark infringement and related claims against us over the display of search results triggered by search terms that include trademark terms. Currently, we are engaged in lawsuits regarding such trademark issues. As we expand our business and develop new technologies, products and services, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement claims. In the event that there is a determination that we have infringed third-party proprietary rights such as patents, copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights, or other third-party rights such as publicity and privacy rights, we could incur substantial monetary liability, be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements or be prevented from using such rights, which could require us to change our business practices in the future and limit our ability to compete effectively. We may also incur substantial expenses in defending against third-party infringement claims regardless of the merit of such claims. In addition, many of our agreements with our customers or Affiliates require us to indemnify them for some types of third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase our costs in defending such claims and our damages. The occurrence of any of these results could harm our brand and negatively impact our operating results. We are subject to U.S. and foreign government regulation of Internet, mobile, and voice over internet protocol, or VOIP, products and services which could subject us to claims, judgments, and remedies including monetary liabilities and limitations on our business practices. We are subject to regulations and laws directly applicable to providers of Internet, mobile, and VOIP services both domestically and internationally. The application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations to Yahoo! relating to issues such as user privacy and data protection, defamation, pricing, advertising, taxation, gambling, sweepstakes, promotions, billing, real estate, consumer protection, accessibility, content regulation, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile, television and intellectual property ownership and infringement in many instances is unclear or unsettled. In addition, we will also be subject to any new laws and regulations directly applicable to our domestic and international activities. Further, the application of existing laws to Yahoo! or our subsidiaries regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our advertisers including, for example, distribution of pharmaceuticals, alcohol, adult content, tobacco, or firearms, as well as insurance and securities brokerage and legal services, can be unclear. Internationally, we may also be subject to laws regulating our activities in foreign countries and to foreign laws and regulations that are inconsistent from country to country. We may incur substantial liabilities for expenses necessary to defend such litigation or to comply with these laws and regulations, as well as potential substantial penalties for any failure to comply. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also cause us to change or limit our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. A number of U.S. federal laws, including those referenced below, impact our business. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is intended, in part, to limit the liability of eligible online service providers for listing or linking to third-party Websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others. Portions 14 Table of Contents of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third-party content. Yahoo! relies on the protections provided by both the DMCA and CDA in conducting its business. Any changes in these laws or judicial interpretations narrowing their protections will subject us to greater risk of liability and may increase our costs of compliance with these regulations or limit our ability to operate certain lines of business. The Childrens Online Protection Act and the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act are intended to restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors. In addition, the Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances. U.S. export control laws and regulations impose requirements and restrictions on exports to certain nations and persons and on our business. The costs of compliance with these regulations may increase in the future as a result of changes in the regulations or the interpretation of them. Further, any failure on our part to comply with these regulations may subject us to significant liabilities. Changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data, or any failure to comply with such laws, could adversely affect our business. Federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users. We have posted on our and many of our Affiliates Websites our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders, or other federal, state, or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Further, failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies, applicable requirements, or industry self-regulatory principles related to the collection, use, sharing or security of personal information, or other privacy or data protection-related matters could result in a loss of user confidence in us, damage to the Yahoo! brands, and ultimately in a loss of users, advertising partners, or Affiliates which could adversely affect our business. In addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact new or additional laws and regulations concerning data privacy and retention issues which could adversely impact our business. The interpretation and application of privacy, data protection and data retention laws and regulations are currently unsettled in the U.S. and internationally. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current data protection policies and practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. We may be subject to legal liability for online services. We host a wide variety of services and technology products that enable individuals and businesses to exchange information, generate content, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities on a domestic and an international basis. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the U.S. and internationally. Claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by our users. In addition, Yahoo! has been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that the availability of certain content within our services violates laws in domestic and international jurisdictions. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources and may require us to change our business in a manner adverse to our business. 15 Table of Contents We arrange for the distribution of third-party advertisements to third-party publishers and advertising networks, and we offer third-party products, services, or content, such as stock quotes and trading information, under the Yahoo! brand or via distribution on Yahoo! Properties. We may be subject to claims concerning these products, services, or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting, or providing access to them, even if we do not ourselves host, operate, provide, or provide access to these products, services, or content. While our agreements with respect to these products, services, and content, often provide that we will be indemnified against such liabilities, the ability to receive such indemnification depends on the financial resources of the other party to the agreement and any amounts received might not be adequate to cover our liabilities or the costs associated with defense of such proceedings. It is also possible that if the manner in which information is provided or any information provided directly by us contains errors or is otherwise wrongfully provided to users, third parties could make claims against us. For example, we offer Web-based e-mail services, which expose us to potential risks, such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited e-mail, lost or misdirected messages, illegal or fraudulent use of e-mail, or interruptions or delays in e-mail service. We may also face purported consumer class actions or state actions relating to our online services, including our fee-based services (particularly in connection with any decision to discontinue a fee-based service). In addition, our customers, third-parties or government entities may assert claims or actions against us if our online services or technologies are used to spread or facilitate malicious or harmful applications. Investigating and defending these types of claims is expensive, even if the claims are without merit or do not ultimately result in liability, could subject us to significant monetary liability or cause a change in business practices that could impact our ability to compete. Acquisitions and strategic investments could result in adverse impacts on our operations and in unanticipated liabilities. We have acquired, and have made strategic investments in, a number of companies (including through joint ventures) in the past, and we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future. Such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, use of our cash resources, and incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Our acquisitions and strategic investments to date were accompanied by a number of risks, including:  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of our acquired companies into our operations;  the potential disruption of our on-going business and distraction of management;  the incurrence of additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;  the difficulty of integrating acquired technology and rights into our services and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;  the failure to successfully further develop acquired technology resulting in the impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;  the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected;  the potential for patent and trademark infringement claims against the acquired company;  the impairment of relationships with customers and partners of the companies we acquired or in which we invested or with our customers and partners as a result of the integration of acquired operations;  the impairment of relationships with employees of the acquired companies or our existing employees as a result of integration of new management personnel;  our lack of, or limitations on, our control over the operations of our joint venture companies;  in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, uncertainty regarding foreign laws and regulations and difficulty integrating operations and systems as a result of cultural, systems, and operational differences; and 16 Table of Contents  the impact of known potential liabilities or unknown liabilities associated with the companies we acquired or in which we invested. We are likely to experience similar risks in connection with our future acquisitions and strategic investments. Our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally. Any failure to manage expansion, diversification, and changes to our business could adversely affect our operating results. We continue to diversify and evolve our business both in the U.S. and internationally. As a result of diversification, acquisitions, and international expansion in recent years, more than one-half of our employees are now based outside of our Sunnyvale, California headquarters. If we are unable to effectively manage a large and geographically dispersed group of employees or to anticipate our future growth and personnel needs our business may be adversely affected. As we expand and diversify our business, we must also expand and adapt our operational infrastructure. Our business relies on data systems, billing systems, and financial reporting and control systems, among others. All of these systems have become increasingly complex in the recent past due to the growing diversification and complexity of our business, to acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and to increased regulation over controls and procedures. To manage our business in a cost effective manner, we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems, billing systems, and other operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. In some cases, we are outsourcing administrative functions to lower-cost providers. These upgrades, improvements and outsourcing changes will require a dedication of resources and in some cases are likely to be complex. If we are unable to adapt our systems and put adequate controls in place in a timely manner, our business may be adversely affected. In particular, sustained failures of our billing systems to accommodate increasing numbers of transactions, to accurately bill users and advertisers, or to accurately compensate Affiliates could adversely affect the viability of our business model. Any failure to scale and adapt our existing technology architecture to manage expansion and respond to rapid technological change could adversely affect our business. As some of the most visited sites on the Internet, Yahoo! Properties deliver a significant number of products, services, and page views to users around the world. The products and services offered by Yahoo! have expanded and changed significantly over time and are expected to continue to expand and change rapidly in the future to accommodate new technologies and Internet advertising solutions and new means of content delivery, such as rich media, audio, video, and mobile. In addition, the Internet and online services industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Widespread adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies, or other technological changes could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure. The technology architectures utilized for our services are highly complex and may not provide satisfactory support in the future, as usage increases and products and services expand, change and become more complex. In the future, we may make additional changes to our architectures and systems, including moving to completely new architectures and systems. Such changes may be technologically challenging to develop and implement, may take time to test and deploy, may cause us to incur substantial costs or data loss, and may cause delays or interruptions in service. These changes, delays, or interruptions in our service may cause our users, Affiliates and other advertising exchange participants to become dissatisfied with our service and move to competing providers or seek remedial actions or compensation. Further, to the extent that demands for our services increase, we will need to expand our infrastructure, including the capacity of our hardware servers and the sophistication of our software. This expansion is likely to be expensive and 17 Table of Contents complex and require additional technical expertise. As we acquire users who rely upon us for a wide variety of services, it becomes more technologically complex and costly to retrieve, store, and integrate data that will enable us to track each users preferences. Any difficulties experienced in adapting our architectures and infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic, to store user data, and track user preferences, together with the associated costs and potential loss of traffic, could harm our operating results, cash flows from operations, and financial condition. We have dedicated considerable resources to provide a variety of premium services, which might not prove to be successful in generating significant revenue for us. We offer fee-based enhancements to many of our free services, including e-mail, personals, finance, games, music, photographs, and sports. The development cycles for these technologies are long and generally require significant investment by us. We have invested and will continue to invest in new products and services. Some of these new products and services might not generate anticipated revenue or might not meet anticipated user adoption rates. We have previously discontinued some non-profitable premium services and may discontinue others. We must, however, continue to provide new services that are compelling to our users while continuing to develop an effective method for generating revenues for such services. General economic conditions as well as the rapidly evolving competitive landscape may affect users willingness to pay for such services. If we cannot generate revenues from these services that are greater than the cost of providing such services, our operating results could be harmed. If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, we might not be able to execute our business plan. Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate and retain talented, highly skilled personnel. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including the intense competition for such highly skilled personnel in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our corporate headquarters and the headquarters of several of our vertical and horizontal competitors are located, fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, changes in Yahoo!s management or leadership, competitors hiring practices, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. If we do not succeed in recruiting, retaining, and motivating our key employees and in attracting new key personnel, we may be unable to meet our business plan and as a result, our stock price may decline. If we are unable to license or acquire compelling content at reasonable cost or if we do not develop or commission compelling content of our own, the number of users of our services may not grow as anticipated, or may decline, or users level of engagement with our services may decline, all or any of which could harm our operating results. Our future success depends in part on our ability to aggregate compelling content and deliver that content through our online properties. We in-license much of the content on our online properties, such as news items, stock quotes, weather reports, maps and audio and video content, from third-parties. We believe that users will increasingly demand high-quality audio and video content, such as music, film, speeches, news footage, concerts, and other special events. Such content may require us to make substantial payments to third parties from whom we license or acquire such content. Our ability to maintain and build relationships with third-party content providers is critical to our success. In addition, as new methods for accessing the Internet become available, including through alternative devices, we may need to enter into amended content agreements with existing third-party content providers to cover the new devices. We may be unable to enter into new, or preserve existing, relationships with the third-parties whose content we seek to obtain. In addition, as competition for compelling content increases both domestically and internationally, our content providers may increase the prices at which they offer their content to us, and potential content providers may not offer their content to us at all, or may offer it on terms that are not agreeable to us. An increase in the prices charged to us by third-party content providers could harm our operating results and financial condition. Further, many of our content licenses with third-parties are non-exclusive. Accordingly, other Webcasters and other media providers, such as radio or television providers, may be able to offer similar or identical content. This increases the importance of our ability to deliver compelling editorial content and personalization of this content for users in order to differentiate Yahoo! from other businesses. If we are unable to license or acquire compelling content at reasonable prices, if other 18 Table of Contents companies broadcast content that is similar to or the same as that provided by Yahoo!, or if we do not develop compelling editorial content or personalization services, the number of users of our services may not grow as anticipated, or may decline, which could harm our operating results. We rely on third-party providers of rich media products to provide the technologies required to deliver rich media content to our users, and any change in the licensing terms, costs, availability or user acceptance of these products could adversely affect our business. We rely on leading providers of streaming media products to license the software necessary to deliver rich media content to our users. There can be no assurance that these providers will continue to license these products to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Our users are currently able to electronically download copies of the software to play rich media free of charge, but providers of rich media products may begin charging users for copies of their player software or otherwise change their business model in a manner that slows the widespread acceptance of these products. In order for our rich media services to be successful, there must be a large base of users of these rich media products. We have limited or no control over the availability or acceptance of rich media software, and to the extent that any of these circumstances occur, our business may be adversely affected. If we are unable to attract, sustain and renew distribution arrangements on favorable terms, our revenues might decline. We enter into distribution arrangements with operators of third-party Websites, online networks, software companies, electronics companies, computer manufacturers and others to promote or supply our services to their users. For example:  We supply search and display advertising to Affiliate sites, which integrate our advertising offerings into their Websites;  We enter into distribution alliances with Internet service providers (including providers of cable and broadband Internet access) and software distributors to promote our services to their users; and  We enter into agreements with mobile device manufacturers and carriers as well as Internet-enabled television manufacturers and other electronics companies to promote our software and services on their devices. In some markets we depend on a limited number of distribution arrangements for a significant percentage of our user activity. A failure by our distributors to attract or retain their user bases would negatively impact our user activity and, in turn, would reduce our revenues. Distribution agreements often involve revenue sharing. Over time, competition to enter into distribution arrangements may cause our traffic acquisition costs to increase. In some cases, we guarantee distributors a minimum level of revenues and, as a result, run a risk that the distributors might not generate enough ad impressions, toolbar installations, etc. to otherwise earn their minimum payments. In other cases, we agree that if the distributor does not realize specified minimum revenues we will adjust the distributors revenue-share percentage or provide make-whole arrangements. Some of our distribution agreements are not exclusive, have a short term, are terminable at will, or are subject to early termination provisions. The loss of distributors, increased distribution costs, or the renewal of distribution agreements on significantly less favorable terms might cause our revenues to decline. More individuals are utilizing non-Personal Computer (PC), devices to access the Internet and versions of our services developed for these devices might not gain widespread adoption by the devices users, manufacturers, or distributors or might fail to function as intended on some devices. The number of individuals who access the Internet through devices other than a PC, such as mobile telephones, personal digital assistants, smart phones, hand held computers, televisions, and set-top box devices, has increased dramatically, and the trend is likely to continue. Our services were originally designed for rich, graphical 19 Table of Contents environments such as those available on the desktop and PC. The lower resolution, functionality, and memory associated with alternative devices currently available may make the use of our services through such devices difficult, and the versions of our services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users, manufacturers, or distributors of alternative devices. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. As we have limited experience to date in operating versions of our services developed or optimized for users of alternative devices, and as new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our services for use on these alternative devices, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such versions. We may be unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, distributors, content providers, and users to our services, or to capture a sufficient share of an increasingly important portion of the market for these services, and, therefore, we may be unsuccessful in attracting both advertisers and premium service subscribers to these services. To the extent that an access provider or device manufacturer enters into a distribution arrangement with one of our competitors, we face an increased risk that our users will favor the services or properties of that competitor. The manufacturer or access provider might promote a competitors services or might impair users access to our services by making its devices incompatible with our software or by not listing our services in a convenient directory. If competitive distributors impair access to our services, or if they simply are more successful than our distributors in developing compelling products that attract and retain users or advertisers, then our revenues could decline. In the future, as new methods for accessing the Internet become available, including through alternative devices, we may need to enter into amended distribution agreements with existing distributors to cover the new devices and new agreements with additional distributors. We face a risk that existing and potential new distributors may decide not to offer distribution of our properties and services on reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail to obtain distribution or to obtain distribution on terms that are reasonable, we might not be able to fully execute our business plan. In international markets we compete with local Internet service providers that may have competitive advantages. In a number of international markets, especially those in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, we face substantial competition from local Internet service providers and other portals that offer search, communications, and other commercial services. Many of these companies have a dominant market share in their territories and are owned by local telecommunications providers which give them a competitive advantage. Local providers of competing online services may also have a substantial advantage over us in attracting users in their country due to more established branding in that country, greater knowledge with respect to the tastes and preferences of users residing in that country and/or their focus on a single market. Further, the local providers may have greater regulatory and operational flexibility than Yahoo! due to the fact that we are subject to both U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements. We must continue to improve our local offerings, become more knowledgeable about our local users and their preferences, deepen our relationships with our local users as well as increase our branding and other marketing activities in order to remain competitive and strengthen our international market position. Our international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition to uncertainty about our ability to continue to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand our international market position, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:  trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;  difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; 20 Table of Contents  stringent local labor laws and regulations;  longer payment cycles;  credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;  profit repatriation restrictions, and foreign currency exchange restrictions;  political or social unrest, economic instability, repression or human rights issues;  geopolitical events, including acts of war and terrorism;  import or export regulations;  compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;  seasonal volatility in business activity;  laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit foreign ownership of certain businesses;  different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws; and  risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws. Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and could result in harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. New technologies could block our advertisements or our search marketing listings, which would harm our operating results. Technologies have been developed and are likely to continue to be developed that can block the display of our advertisements or our search marketing listings. Most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of advertisements or clicks on search marketing listings on Web pages. As a result, advertisement-blocking technology could reduce the number and relevancy of advertisements and search results that we are able to deliver and, in turn, our advertising revenues and operating results. Proprietary document formats may limit the effectiveness of our search technology by preventing our technology from accessing the content of documents in such formats, which could limit the effectiveness of our products and services. A large amount of information on the Internet is provided in proprietary document formats such as Microsoft Word. These proprietary document formats may limit the effectiveness of our search technology by preventing our technology from accessing the content of such documents. The providers of the software applications used to create these documents could engineer the document format to prevent or interfere with our ability to access the document contents with our search technology. This would mean that the document contents would not be included in our search results even if the contents were directly relevant to a search. The software providers may also seek to require us to pay them royalties in exchange for giving us the ability to search documents in their format. If a software provider also competes with us, it may give its search technologies, or the technologies of our competitors, a preferential ability to search documents in its proprietary format. Any of these results could harm our brand and our operating results. 21 Table of Contents Interruptions, delays, or failures in the provision of our services could harm our operating results. Delays or disruptions to our service could result from a variety of causes, including the following:  Our operations are susceptible to outages and interruptions due to fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, and similar events.  Despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, worms, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering, as well as coordinated denial-of-service attacks. We are distributing servers among additional data centers around the world to create redundancies; however, we do not have multiple site capacity for all of our services and some of our systems are not fully redundant in the event of delays or disruptions to service.  We rely on third-party providers for our principal Internet connections and co-location of a significant portion of our data servers, as well as for key components of our e-mail and VOIP services, news and stock quote delivery, chat services, mapping, streaming, and other services. We have little or no control over these third-party providers. Any disruption of the services they provide us or any failure of these third-party providers to handle higher volumes of use could, in turn, cause delays or disruptions in our services. Prolonged delays or disruptions to our service could result in a loss of users, damage our brand and harm our operating results. In addition, users ability or willingness to access our services might be impaired by spam, viruses, worms, spyware, phishing, and other acts of malice by third parties affecting the user generally or the users use of our services in particular. If we fail to prevent click fraud or if we choose to manage traffic quality in a way that advertisers find unsatisfactory, our profitability might decline. A portion of our marketing services revenues arises from advertisers that pay for advertising on a price-per-click basis, meaning that the advertisers pay a fee every time a user clicks on their advertising. This pricing model can be vulnerable to so-called click fraud, which occurs when clicks are submitted on ads by a user who is motivated by reasons other than genuine interest in the subject of the ad. On Yahoo! Properties and Affiliate sites, we are exposed to the risk of click fraud or other clicks or conversions that advertisers may perceive as undesirable. If fraudulent or other malicious activity is perpetrated by others and we are unable to detect and prevent it, or if we choose to manage traffic quality in a way that advertisers find unsatisfactory, the affected advertisers may experience or perceive a reduced return on their investment in our advertising programs which could lead the advertisers to become dissatisfied with our advertising programs and they might refuse to pay or demand refunds. This could damage our brand and lead to a loss of advertisers and revenues. Advertiser dissatisfaction has led to litigation alleging click fraud and other types of traffic quality-related claims and could potentially lead to further litigation or government regulation of advertising. We may also issue refunds or credits as a result of such activity. Any increase in costs due to any such litigation, government regulation or legislation, refunds or credits could negatively impact our profitability. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results in U.S. dollar terms. A portion of our revenues arises from international operations. Revenues generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries. As a result, our consolidated U.S. dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into U.S. dollars. In addition, our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in non-local currencies. 22 Table of Contents We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, or investments in equity interests become impaired. We are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our amortizable intangible assets and investments in equity interests for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of our business. Factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests include a prolonged period of decline in the stock price or operating performance of, or an announcement of adverse changes or events by, the company in which we invested. We have recorded and may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if a portion of our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, or investments in equity interests becomes impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our results of operations. We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities which could negatively impact our income tax provision, net income, and cash flow. We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Uncertainty resulting from potential proposals to acquire all or part of Yahoo! may adversely affect our business. In 2008, we received proposals to acquire all or a part of our Company. Third parties may in the future make proposals to acquire all or part of the Company or take other actions that might create uncertainty for our employees, publishers, advertisers, and other business partners. This continuing uncertainty could negatively impact our business. Our stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile regardless of our operating performance. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. During the quarter ended December 31, 2008, the closing sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from $8.95 to $16.96 per share and the closing sale price on February 13, 2009 was $12.84 per share. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating results, announcements and implementations of technological innovations or new services, upgrades and media properties by us or our competitors; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us; the operating performance of companies in which we have an equity investment, including Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba Group Holding Limited; and news reports relating to us, trends in our markets, or general economic conditions. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for Internet-related companies in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, all of whom have been granted stock options or other stock-based awards. A sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization could lead to an impairment charge of our long-lived assets. 23 Table of Contents Anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us. We have adopted a stockholder rights plan and initially declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of March 20, 2001. As a result of our two-for-one stock split effective May 11, 2004, each share of common stock is now associated with one-half of one right. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one unit consisting of one one-thousandth of a share of our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for $250 per unit. Under certain circumstances, if a person or group acquires 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock, holders of the rights (other than the person or group triggering their exercise) will be able to purchase, in exchange for the $250 exercise price, shares of our common stock or of any company into which we are merged having a value of $500. The rights expire on March 1, 2011, unless extended by our Board of Directors. Because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our Board of Directors, our rights plan could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us (or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock) without first negotiating with our Board of Directors regarding that acquisition. In addition, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 10 million shares of Preferred Stock (of which 2 million shares have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any Preferred Stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of Preferred Stock may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of Yahoo! without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. Further, some provisions of our charter documents, including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of Yahoo!, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock. In addition, our charter documents do not permit cumulative voting, which may make it more difficult for a third-party to gain control of our Board of Directors. Further, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will prohibit us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if such combination is favored by a majority of stockholders, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Yahoo!. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
