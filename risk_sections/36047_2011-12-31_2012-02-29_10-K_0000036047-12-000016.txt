Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business1.We depend on our ability to access data from external sources to maintain and grow our businesses. If we are unable to access needed data from these sources or if the prices charged for these services increase, the quality, pricing and availability of our products and services may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We rely extensively upon data from a variety of external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data from third-party suppliers, various government and public record sources and data contributed by our customers. Our data sources could withdraw their data from us, increase the price we pay for their data, or limit our use of their data for a variety of reasons, including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use. If a number of suppliers are no longer able or are unwilling to provide us with certain data, or if our public record sources of data become unavailable or the cost becomes economically unfeasible, we may need to find alternative sources. If we are unable to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and efficiently and effectively integrate these data sources into our service offerings, we could experience service disruptions, increased costs and reduced quality of our services. Additionally, if one or more of our suppliers terminates our existing agreements with them, there is no assurance that we will obtain new agreements with other suppliers on terms favorable to us, if at all. Loss of such access or the availability of data in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all may reduce the quality and availability of our services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, some of our suppliers compete with us in certain product offerings, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases. Significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins and our financial position, in particular if we are unable to arrange for substitute sources of data on more favorable economic terms.2.Failure to comply with government regulations or changes in government regulations could result in regulatory penalties or prohibit or limit our or our customers' operations or make it more burdensome to conduct such operations, which could have a material adverse effect on revenues, earnings and cash flows.Many of our and our customers' businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide certain services, imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties, substantial regulatory and compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity and loss of revenue. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our customers and our customers' auditors and regulators. Moreover, since we provide a variety of key services to federally regulated financial institutions, it appears more likely that federal financial institution regulators will also seek to perform compliance examinations on various parts of our operations. In addition, several of our largest bank customers are subject to consent orders with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which require them to exercise greater oversight and perform more rigorous audits of their vendors like us.Additional changes in the applicable regulatory environment or interpretations of existing regulations or statutes or enhanced governmental oversight of us or our customers could negatively affect our operations. These changes may compel us to increase our prices in certain situations or decrease our prices in other situations, may restrict our ability to implement price increases, and may limit the manner in which we conduct our business or otherwise may have a negative impact on our ability to generate revenues, earnings and cash flows.In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act and the extensive regulations being promulgated thereunder materially alter consumer and financial markets regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act expands regulation of real estate appraisals, appraisal management companies, BPOs and AVMs. We also believe it is likely that some of our activities, such as our credit reporting businesses, will be subject to examination and more active oversight by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by the Dodd-Frank Act. If we are unable to adapt our products and services to conform to the new laws and regulations, or if these laws and regulations continue to have a negative impact on our customers, we may experience customer losses or increased operating costs, and our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.3.Regulatory developments with respect to use of consumer data and public records could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Because our databases include certain public and non-public personal information concerning consumers, we are subject to government regulation and potential adverse publicity concerning the use of consumer data. We provide many types 16Table of Contentsof consumer data and related services that already are subject to regulation under the FCRA, the GLBA, and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act and, to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace. Failure to comply with these laws by us could result in substantial regulatory penalties, litigation expense and loss of revenue. In addition, our data suppliers face similar regulatory requirements and, consequently, they may cease to be able to provide data to us or may substantially increase the fees they charge us for this data which may make it financially burdensome or impossible for us to acquire data that is necessary to offer our products and services. Further, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. As a result, they are seeking further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. Any such restrictions may reduce the quality and availability of our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.4.If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, or if we are unable to provide adequate security in the electronic transmission of sensitive data, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for business-to-business and business-to-consumer electronic commerce. Security breaches of this infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Unauthorized access could jeopardize the security of information stored in our systems and can lead to "phishing" schemes whereby unauthorized persons pose as employees or other valid personnel and seek to obtain personal or confidential information from our systems. In addition, malware or viruses could jeopardize the security of information stored or used in a user's computer. If we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive consumer data.Likewise, our customers are increasingly imposing more stringent contractual obligations on us relating to our information security protections. If we are unable to maintain protections and processes at a level commensurate with that required by our large customers, it could negatively affect our relationships with those customers or increase our operating costs, which could harm our business or reputation.5.Systems interruptions may impair the delivery of our products and services, causing potential customer and revenue loss.System interruptions may impair the delivery of our products and services, resulting in a loss of customers and a corresponding loss in revenue. We depend heavily upon computer systems located in our data centers, including our centers in Santa Ana, California and Westlake, Texas. Certain events beyond our control, including natural disasters and telecommunications failures, could interrupt the delivery of products and services. These interruptions also may interfere with our suppliers' ability to provide necessary data and our employees' ability to attend work and perform their responsibilities. Such interruptions and intrusions may cause a loss of customers or a loss in revenue.6.Our revenue from customers in the mortgage and consumer lending industries is affected by the volume of real estate transactions. As a result, declines in transaction volumes in these industries may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.A significant portion of our revenue is generated from solutions we provide to the mortgage and consumer lending industries. These industries have been affected by decreased volumes in mortgage origination and residential real estate transactions. Reductions in these transaction volumes could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, declines in the level of loans seriously delinquent (loans delinquent 90 days or more) or loans in foreclosure and delays in the default cycle continue to negatively affect the demand for many of our products and services in our default services segment. These economic conditions have also had an impact on and continue to impact the performance and financial condition of some of our customers in many of our businesses, which may lead to negative impacts on our revenue, earnings and liquidity.7.We do not solely control the operations and dividend policies of our partially-owned affiliates, including our National Joint Ventures. A decrease in earnings or dividends from these joint ventures could have a negative 17Table of Contentsimpact on our earnings and cash flow. In our National Joint Ventures with some of our largest customers, we share control of the management of the operations of the joint venture with the other partner. As a result, we cannot solely dictate the business strategy, operations or dividend policies of these joint ventures without the cooperation of the respective partners. A decrease in earnings and dividends derived from these joint ventures could have a negative impact on our earnings and cash flow, and we may not have the ability to prevent such a decrease. In addition, our joint venture partners could decide to exit the joint venture or otherwise terminate the operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.8.We rely on our top customers for a significant portion of our revenue and profit, which makes us susceptible to the same macro-economic factors that our customers face. If these customers are negatively impacted by current economic conditions, or if the terms of our relationships with these customers change, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. The ten largest U.S. mortgage originators generated 40.3% of our 2011 operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, and one customer, Wells Fargo, N.A., accounted for 11.4% of our 2011 operating revenues. These customers face continued pressure in the current economic and regulatory climate. Many of our relationships with these customers are long-standing and are important to our future operating results, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements or maintain our relationships on acceptable terms or at all. Deterioration in any of these relationships could significantly reduce our revenue and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.9.We rely upon proprietary technology and information rights, and if we are unable to protect our rights, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology and information. This protection is limited, and our intellectual property could be used by others without our consent. In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Any infringement, disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. Moreover, litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be time-consuming, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.10.If our products or services are found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties.As we continue to develop and expand our products and services, we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims from third parties such as non-practicing entities, software providers or suppliers of data. Likewise, if we are unable to maintain adequate controls over how third-party software and data are used we may be subject to claims of infringement. Any claims, whether with or without merit, could:•be expensive and time-consuming to defend;•cause us to cease making, licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;•require us to redesign our applications, if feasible;•divert management's attention and resources; and•require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies.11.Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding debt.We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2011, our total debt is approximately $908.3 million, and we have unused commitments of approximately $499.0 million under our credit facilities. Subject to the limitations contained in the credit agreement governing our credit facilities, the indenture governing the 7.25% senior notes and our other debt instruments, we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other general corporate purposes. If we do so, the risks 18Table of Contentsrelated to our high level of debt could intensify. Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including:•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes, our credit facilities and our other debt;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and investments or acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•exposing us to the risk of increased rates as certain of our borrowings, in particular the borrowings under our credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;•limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industries in which we compete;•placing us at a disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors; and •increasing our cost of borrowing.12. The instruments governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that could limit our operating flexibility.The indenture governing the notes and the credit agreement governing our credit facilities each impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions include the financial covenants in our credit facilities which require on-going compliance with certain financial tests and ratios, including a minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio. The operating and financial restrictions in the indenture or the credit agreement could limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:•create, incur or assume additional debt;•create, incur or assume certain liens;•redeem and/or prepay certain subordinated debt we might issue in the future;•pay dividends on our stock or repurchase stock;•make certain investments and acquisitions, including joint ventures;•enter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;•enter into new lines of business;•engage in consolidations, mergers and acquisitions;•engage in specified sales of assets; and•enter into transactions with affiliates.These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could impact our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us. Our failure to comply with these restrictions could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all our debt. 13. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the notes or the lenders under our credit facilities could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, and the lenders under our credit facilities could terminate their revolving commitments to loan money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 14. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debtservice obligations to increase significantly.19Table of ContentsBorrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $908.3 million in long-term debt outstanding, of which approximately $392.3 million was variable interest rate debt. We have entered into interest rate swaps, which converted the interest rate exposure on $195.0 million of our floating rate debt from variable to fixed rate as of December 31, 2011. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an approximately $2.0 million change to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011. 15. We operate in a competitive business environment, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.The markets for our products and services are intensely competitive. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. We compete for existing and new customers against both third parties and the in-house capabilities of our customers. Some of our competitors, such as the credit bureaus, have substantial resources. Some have widely-used technology platforms that they seek to use as a competitive advantage to drive sales of other products and services. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies. These competitors and new technologies may render our existing technology obsolete, resulting in operating inefficiencies and increased competitive pressure. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.16.The acquisition and integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the desired financial or operating results.During 2011, we completed the acquisitions of various businesses in separate transactions, and announced the planned divestiture of certain other businesses to better align with our strategic focus. Expected benefits, synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned. In addition, we may have difficulty integrating our completed or any future acquisitions into our operations. If we fail to properly integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies and personnel, it could impair relationships with employees, customers and strategic partners, distract management attention, result in control failures and otherwise disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations. We also may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition. In addition, our future business strategy may include growth through strategic acquisitions, and we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, obtain the capital necessary to pursue acquisitions or complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms. 17.Our international outsourcing service providers and our own international operations subject us to additional risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Dependence on these operations, in particular our outsourcing arrangements, may impair our ability to operate effectively. Over the last few years, we have reduced our costs by utilizing lower cost labor outside the U.S. in countries such as India and the Philippines, primarily through outsourcing arrangements. These countries are subject to relatively higher degrees of political and social instability than the U.S. and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest or natural disasters. Such disruptions can impact our ability to deliver our products and services on a timely basis if at all, and to a lesser extent can decrease efficiency and increase our costs. Weakness of the U.S. dollar in relation to the currencies used and higher inflation rates experienced in these countries may also reduce the savings we planned to achieve through this strategy. Furthermore, the practice of utilizing labor based in foreign countries has come under increased scrutiny in the United States and, as a result, some of our customers may require us to use labor based in the U.S. We may not be able to pass on the increased costs of higher-priced U.S.-based labor to our customers, which ultimately could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. There is a possibility that the foreign countries in which we have outsourcing arrangements or operate could adopt new legislation or regulations that would adversely affect our business by making it difficult, more costly or impossible for us to continue our foreign activities as currently being conducted. In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA. Any violations of FCPA or local anti-corruption laws by us, our subsidiaries or our local agents, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation and result in substantial financial penalties or other sanctions.20Table of Contents18. We may not realize the full benefit of our outsourcing arrangements, which may result in increased costs, or may adversely affect our service levels for our customers.We outsource various business process and information technology services to various third parties, including the outsourcing arrangement we entered into with a subsidiary of Cognizant Technology Solutions, and may outsource additional functions to third-party providers in the future. Under our outsourcing arrangements, we rely on the outsource partners to provide services on a timely and effective basis. Although we have service level arrangements governing the performance of these third parties, we do not ultimately control the performance of our outsourcing partners. To the extent our customers object to the outsourcing of services we provide for them either because the services are provided offshore or because of quality issues, we may be required to perform such services directly at a higher cost. The failure of our outsourcing partners to perform as expected or as contractually required could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, and to the services we provide to our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, customer relationships, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Our outsourcing arrangement with Cognizant Technology Solutions subjects us to a net cumulative minimum commitment of approximately $303.5 million, plus applicable inflation adjustments, over the next five years, which we are required to pay regardless of the actual value of the services it provides. This minimum commitment could negatively affect our cost structure and our ability to divest operations which utilize services under this outsourcing agreement.19.We may not be able to attract and retain qualified management or develop current management to keep pace with company growth, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain or increase our product and service offerings.We rely on skilled management and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of such individuals. If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. We compete for talented individuals not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of individuals who have the skills and training needed to grow our company. Increased attrition or competition for qualified management could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and product offerings, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.20.We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions and an impairment of these investments would require a write-down that would reduce our net income.In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, existing goodwill is not amortized but instead is required to be assessed for impairment annually or sooner if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends. In the event that the book value of goodwill is impaired, any such impairment would be charged to earnings in the period of impairment. In the event of significant volatility in the capital markets or a worsening of current economic conditions, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Possible future impairment of goodwill under accounting guidance may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.21. The impact and results of the announcement that we were evaluating strategic alternatives, and the subsequent announcement that the review has terminated, are uncertain.On August 29, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors formed a committee of independent directors to explore a wide range of strategic alternatives aimed at enhancing stockholder value including, but not limited to, cost savings initiatives, an evaluation of our capital structure, possible repurchases of debt and common stock, the potential disposition of business lines, the potential sale or business combination of us and other alternatives. On February 27, 2012, we announced that the independent committee had concluded its review of strategic alternatives. The independent committee determined that, after a thorough review of the various alternatives, it would be in the best interest of CoreLogic and its stockholders for the Company to continue its present strategic course toward increased value creation for stockholders. Although now concluded, the strategic review process added a level of uncertainty to our business and operations, including in the customer purchase and renewal and employee hiring and retention contexts. In addition to the business risks, the market price of our common stock could continue to be subject to fluctuation.21Table of Contents22. We may not be able to effectively achieve our cost-containment or growth strategies, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.Our cost-containment and growth strategies include strategic outsourcing, labor management, streamlining functions and improving overall processes. Although we have implemented many of these plans, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to realize all of the projected benefits of our cost-containment and growth strategies. Our cost-containment efforts could impair our ability to attract and retain resources and can also prohibit us from being able to execute effectively and efficiently on our plans.Risks Relating to the Separation of FAFC1.Our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future results as a stand-alone company.The historical financial information we have included in prior filings for periods ending prior to June 1, 2010, and the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 filed on Form 8-K on March 22, 2010, may not reflect what our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had we been a stand-alone company during the periods presented and may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be in the future now that we are a stand-alone company. Specifically, the pro forma financial information and the financial information does not reflect any increased costs associated with being a stand-alone company, including changes in our cost structure and personnel needs. 2.The Separation could give rise to liabilities, increased operating expense or other unfavorable effects that may not have otherwise arisen.The Separation may lead to increased operating and other expenses, both of a non-recurring and a recurring nature, and changes to certain operations, which expenses or changes could arise pursuant to arrangements made with FAFC or the triggering of rights and obligations to other parties. In addition, the Separation may provide more competition in our business than it would have if the companies remained together. For example, FAFC has a small offering of appraisal-related services that may compete with certain of our products and services. With the exception of a noncompetition agreement related to the tax services business, there will be no prohibition on either us or FAFC competing with each other. Litigation with FAFC or other parties could also arise out of the transaction.3.We are responsible for a portion of FAFC's contingent and other corporate liabilities.Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement we entered into with FAFC and related agreements, subject to certain exceptions contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement, we and FAFC are each responsible for 50% of certain of FAC's contingent and other corporate liabilities. External costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate liabilities are shared equally. These contingent and other corporate liabilities primarily relate to any third party claims related to the Separation or the Distribution. Contingent and other corporate liabilities that relate only to the information solutions business were generally allocated to us and those that relate only to the financial services business were generally allocated to FAFC.If FAFC were to default on a payment obligation related to these liabilities, we may be required to pay the amount in default. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the agreed-upon share of the contingent and other corporate liabilities, including associated expenses.4.We share responsibility with FAFC for certain income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the date of the Distribution.Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we are generally responsible for taxes attributable to members of the information solutions group of companies or the assets, liabilities or businesses of the information group of companies and FAFC is generally responsible for all taxes attributable to members of the FAFC group of companies or the assets, liabilities or businesses of the FAFC group of companies. Generally, any liabilities arising from adjustments to prior year (or partial year with respect to 2010) consolidated tax returns will be shared in proportion to each company's percentage of the tax liability for the relevant year (or partial year with respect to 2010), unless the adjustment is attributable to either party, in which case the adjustment will generally be for the account of such party. In addition to this potential liability associated with adjustments for prior periods, if FAFC were to fail to pay any tax liability it is required to pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under 22Table of Contentscertain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of tax liabilities.5.If the Distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Separation are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and FAFC will incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.In connection with the Separation we received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, among other things, certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Separation will qualify for favorable treatment under the Code, the contribution by us of certain assets of the financial services businesses to FAFC, and the pro-rata distribution to our shareholders of the common stock of FAFC will, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In addition, we received opinions of tax counsel to similar effect. The ruling and opinions relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and FAFC regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the Separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that were not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or FAFC after the Separation. If the Separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.In addition, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event the Distribution were determined to be taxable and such determination were the result of actions taken after the Distribution by us or FAFC, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or FAFC as a result thereof.6.In connection with the Separation, we entered into a number of agreements with FAFC setting forth rights and obligations of the parties post Separation. In addition, certain provisions of these agreements provide protection to FAFC in the event of a change of control of us, which could reduce the likelihood of a potential change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable.In connection with the Separation, we and FAFC entered into a number of agreements that set forth certain rights and obligations of the parties post-Separation, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Restrictive Covenants Agreement, certain transition services agreements and leases for our data center and headquarters facilities in Santa Ana. We possess certain rights under those agreements, including without limitation indemnity rights from certain liabilities allocated to FAFC. The failure of FAFC to perform its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In addition, the Separation and Distribution Agreement gives FAFC the right to purchase the equity or assets of our entity or entities directly or indirectly owning the real property databases that we currently own upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. The triggering events include the direct or indirect purchase of the databases by a title insurance underwriter (or its affiliate) or an entity licensed as a title insurance underwriter, including a transaction where a title insurance underwriter (or its affiliate) acquires 25% or more of us. Such a triggering event also triggers the ability of FAFC to terminate our data center and headquarters leases upon 30 days notice. The purchase right expires June 1, 2020. Until the expiration of the purchase right, this provision could have the effect of limiting or discouraging an acquisition of us or preventing a change of control that our stockholders might consider favorable. Likewise, if a triggering event occurs, the loss of ownership of our real property database and our need to move our headquarters and data center very abruptly could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.7.We might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the Separation because of restrictions relating to U.S. federal income tax requirements for tax-free distributions.Our ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted in order to preserve for U.S. federal income tax purposes the tax-free nature of the Distribution by FAC. Even if the Distribution otherwise qualified for tax-free treatment under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, it may result in corporate level taxable gain to us under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of our common stock or FAFC's common stock are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Distribution. For this purpose, any acquisitions or issuances of shares of FAC's common stock within two years before the Distribution, and any acquisitions or issuances of our common stock or FAFC's common stock within two years after the Distribution generally are presumed to be part of such a 23Table of Contentsplan, although FAFC or we may be able to rebut that presumption.Prior to the Distribution, FAC issued to FAFC and FAFC's principal title insurance subsidiary a total of approximately 13 million shares of common stock, which represented approximately 11% of FAC's shares outstanding at the time of the issuance. In addition, in November 2009 FAC issued approximately 9.5 million shares of common stock in connection with its acquisition of the minority interest shares of it's then publicly traded subsidiary, First Advantage Corporation. This represented approximately 9% of FAC's shares currently outstanding. Both of these issuances could count towards the 50% limitation, which could hinder our ability to issue additional shares during the two year period following the Distribution. If an acquisition or issuance of our common stock or FAFC's common stock triggers the application of Section 355(e) of the Code, we would recognize taxable gain for which FAF could be wholly or partially liable as described above.Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, there are restrictions on our ability and FAFC's ability to take actions that could cause the Distribution to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction, including redemption of equity securities, a sale or other disposition of a substantial portion of assets, and an acquisition of a business or assets with equity securities. These restrictions will apply for 25 months following the Distribution, unless the party seeking to engage in such activity obtains the consent of the other party or obtains a private letter ruling from the IRS or an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized firm that such action will not cause the Distribution to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction, and such letter ruling or opinion, as the case may be, is acceptable to each party.Moreover, the Tax Sharing Agreement generally provides that each party thereto is responsible for any taxes imposed on the other party as a result of the failure of the distribution to qualify as a tax-free transaction under the Code if such failure is attributable to post-Distribution actions taken by or in respect of the responsible party or its stockholders, regardless of when the actions occur after the Distribution, the other party consents to such actions or such party obtains a favorable letter ruling or opinion of tax counsel as described above. For example, we would be responsible for a third party's acquisition of us at a time and in a manner that would cause a failure of the Distribution to qualify as a tax-free transaction under the Code. These restrictions may prevent us from entering into transactions which might be advantageous to our stockholders.8.If there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline.Pursuant to the private letter ruling received from the IRS in connection with the Separation, FAFC and its wholly-owned subsidiary First American Title Insurance Company (“FATICO”) will be required, respectively, to dispose of the retained shares of our common stock by June 1, 2015. As a result, FAFC and FATICO, respectively, may be required to sell some or all of its retained shares of our common stock at a time when it might not otherwise choose to do so. Furthermore, any such disposition by FAFC or FATICO, respectively, of its shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. On April 11, 2011, we repurchased 4.0 million shares of our common stock from FATICO for an aggregate cash purchase price of $75.8 million.The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive.Item 1B.
