Item 1A. Risk Factors. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Executive Summary The Company, a REIT, is a fully integrated, self-administered real estate company, engaged in the acquisition, ownership and management of commercial real estate, primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers in the northeastern part of the United States. Other real estate assets include office and industrial properties. The Company’s major tenants include supermarket chains and other retailers who sell basic necessities. At October 31, 2008, the Company owned or had interests in 44 properties containing a total of 3.9 million square feet of GLA of which approximately 95% was leased. The Company derives substantially all of its revenues from rents and operating expense reimbursements received pursuant to long-term leases and focuses its investment activities on community and neighborhood shopping centers, anchored principally by regional supermarket chains. The Company believes, because of the need of consumers to purchase food and other staple goods and services generally available at supermarket-anchored shopping centers, that the nature of its investments provide for relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times. The Company is experiencing and, in fiscal 2009, expects that it will continue to experience increased vacancy rates at some of its shopping centers and a lengthening in the time required for releasing of vacant space, as the current economic downturn continues to negatively affect retail companies. However, the Company believes it is well positioned to weather these difficulties. Notwithstanding the increase in vacancy rates at various properties, approximately 95% of the Company’s portfolio remains leased. The Company has a strong capital structure with, by industry standards, a small amount of debt maturing in the next 12 months that the Company believes it can refinance or repay with available cash or borrowings under its credit facilities. The Company expects to continue to explore acquisition opportunities that might present themselves during this economic downturn consistent with its business strategy. Primarily as a result of recent property acquisitions, the Company’s financial data shows increases in total revenues and expenses from period to period. The Company focuses on increasing cash flow, and consequently the value of its properties, and seeks continued growth through strategic re-leasing, renovations and expansion of its existing properties and selective acquisition of income producing properties, primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers in the northeastern part of the United States. Key elements of the Company’s growth strategies and operating policies are to: § Acquire neighborhood and community shopping centers in the northeastern part of the United States with a concentration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, Westchester and Putnam Counties, New York and Bergen County, New Jersey § Hold core properties for long-term investment and enhance their value through regular maintenance, periodic renovation and capital improvement § Selectively dispose of non-core and underperforming properties and re-deploy the proceeds into properties located in the northeast region § Increase property values by aggressively marketing available GLA and renewing existing leases § Renovate, reconfigure or expand existing properties to meet the needs of existing or new tenants § Negotiate and sign leases which provide for regular or fixed contractual increases to minimum rents § Control property operating and administrative costs 19 Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. This summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Company’s accounting policies included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Revenue Recognition The Company records base rents on a straight-line basis over the term of each lease. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in tenant receivables on the accompanying balance sheets. Most leases contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro-rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area expenses. Adjustments are also made throughout the year to tenant receivables and the related cost recovery income based upon the Company’s best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on a quarterly analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts. The analysis places particular emphasis on past-due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivables, the payment history of the tenants or other debtors, the financial condition of the tenants and any guarantors and management’s assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations, the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations, among other things. Management’s estimates of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants, particularly those at retail properties. Estimates are used to establish reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate tax and insurance costs. The Company analyzes the balance of its estimated accounts receivable for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance for each of its properties by comparing actual recoveries versus actual expenses and any actual write-offs. Based on its analysis, the Company may record an additional amount in its allowance for doubtful accounts related to these items. It is also the Company’s policy to maintain an allowance of approximately 10% of the deferred straight-line rents receivable balance for future tenant credit losses. Real Estate Land, buildings, property improvements, furniture/fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Renovations and/or replacements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The amounts to be capitalized as a result of an acquisition and the periods over which the assets are depreciated or amortized are determined based on estimates as to fair value and the allocation of various costs to the individual assets. The Company allocates the cost of an acquisition based upon the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company also estimates the fair value of intangibles related to its acquisitions. The valuation of the fair value of intangibles involves estimates related to market conditions, probability of lease renewals and the current market value of in-place leases. This market value is determined by considering factors such as the tenant’s industry, location within the property and competition in the specific region in which the property operates. Differences in the amount attributed to the intangible assets can be significant based upon the assumptions made in calculating these estimates. The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful life of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company’s net income. Properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 30-40 years Property Improvements 10-20 years Furniture/Fixtures 3-10 years Tenant Improvements Shorter of lease term or their useful life Asset Impairment On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties may be impaired. A property value is considered impaired when management’s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest) of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property. Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the net carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset. Changes in estimated future cash flows due to changes in the Company’s plans or market and economic conditions could result in recognition of impairment losses which could be substantial. Management does not believe that the value of any of its rental properties is impaired at October 31, 2008. 20 Liquidity and Capital Resources At October 31, 2008, the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1.7 million compared to $4.2 million at October 31, 2007. The Company's sources of liquidity and capital resources include its cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from bank borrowings and long-term mortgage debt, capital financings and sales of real estate investments. Payments of expenses related to real estate operations, debt service, management and professional fees, and dividend requirements place demands on the Company's short-term liquidity. Cash Flows The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements primarily by generating net cash from the operations of its properties. The Company believes that its net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund its short-term liquidity requirements for fiscal 2009 and to meet its dividend requirements necessary to maintain its REIT status. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, net cash flow provided by operations amounted to $45.0 million, $49.3 million and $35.4 million, respectively. Cash dividends paid on common and preferred shares increased to $36.0 million in fiscal 2008 compared to $33.1 million in fiscal 2007 and $32.4 million in fiscal 2006. The Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows which are expected to increase due to property acquisitions and growth in operating income in the existing portfolio and from other sources. The Company derives substantially all of its revenues from rents under existing leases at its properties. The Company’s operating cash flow therefore depends on the rents that it is able to charge to its tenants, and the ability of its tenants to make rental payments. The Company believes that the nature of the properties in which it typically invests ― primarily grocery-anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers ― provides a more stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times, in that consumers still need to purchase basic staples and convenience items. However, even in the geographic areas in which the Company owns properties, general economic downturns may adversely impact the ability of the Company’s tenants to make lease payments and the Company’s ability to re-lease space as leases expire. In either of these cases, the Company’s cash flow could be adversely affected. Net Cash Flows from: Operating Activities Net cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $45.0 million in fiscal 2008, compared to $49.3 million in fiscal 2007 and $35.4 million in fiscal 2006. The changes in operating cash flows were primarily due to increases in the net operating results generated from the Company’s properties and operating cash flows from new properties acquired during those periods and, in 2007, the receipt of a $6 million settlement of a lease guarantee obligation. Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities were $33.7 million in fiscal 2008, $19.5 million in fiscal 2007 and $20.1 million in fiscal 2006. The net cash flows in each of these years were principally due to the acquisition of properties consistent with the Company’s strategic plan to acquire properties in the northeast. The Company acquired five properties in fiscal 2008, two properties in fiscal 2007 and three properties in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, the Company also acquired the remaining limited partnership interest in its Eastchester property for $2.8 million. In fiscal 2007, the Company sold one property for $13.2 million. Sale proceeds were used to purchase an additional property in the northeast. The Company also invests in its properties and regularly pays for capital expenditures for property improvements, tenant costs and leasing commissions. Financing Activities The Company generated net cash from financing activities in fiscal 2008 primarily from the sale of 2,400,000 shares of 8.5% Series E Senior Cumulative Preferred Stock (“Series E Preferred Stock”) in the net amount of $58.0 million. The Company redeemed all of the outstanding shares of 8.99% Series B Senior Cumulative Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”) for $15.0 million in fiscal 2008. The Company borrowed $18.1 million, $14.2 million, and $3.0 million from its revolving lines of credit in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, primarily to finance property acquisitions and to repurchase Class A Common Stock. During the fiscal year ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company repaid borrowings under its revolving lines of credit in the amount of $25.2 million, $2.0 million and $ 3.0 million, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities in each of the fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 reflect distributions to its shareholders each year of $36.0 million in fiscal 2008, $33.1 million in fiscal 2007 and $32.4 million in fiscal 2006. Cash used in financing activities also included $9.0 million in fiscal 2008 and $317,000 in fiscal 2007 for the repurchase of the Company’s shares of Class A Common Stock. Cash used in financing activities for required principal payments on mortgages totaled $1.7 million in fiscal 2008, $2.3 million in fiscal 2007 and $2.4 million in fiscal 2006. The Company repaid mortgages payable totaling $5.3 million in fiscal 2008, $5.7 million in fiscal 2007 and $5.0 million in fiscal 2006. 21 Capital Resources The Company expects to fund its long-term liquidity requirements such as property acquisitions, repayment of indebtedness and capital expenditures through other long-term indebtedness (including indebtedness assumed in acquisitions), proceeds from sales of properties and/or the issuance of equity securities. The Company believes that these sources of capital will continue to be available to it in the future to fund its long-term capital needs; however, there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on its access to capital sources. The Company’s ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon its existing leverage, the value of its unencumbered assets and borrowing limitations imposed by existing lenders. The Company’s ability to raise funds through sales of equity securities is dependent on, among other things, general market conditions for REITs, market perceptions about the Company and its stock price in the market. The Company’s ability to sell properties in the future to raise cash will be dependent upon market conditions at the time of sale. Financings and Debt During fiscal 2008, the Company sold 2,400,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $58.0 million. The Series E Preferred Stock entitles the holders thereof to cumulative cash dividends payable quarterly in arrears at the rate of 8.5% per annum on the $25 per share liquidation preference. In conjunction with the sale of the Series E Preferred Stock the Company redeemed all 150,000 shares of its Series B Preferred Stock, for the redemption price, as defined, in the amount of $15.0 million. The Company used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Series E Preferred Stock to repay variable rate debt and for property acquisitions. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities. There is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates. The extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the Company’s future financing requirements. Mortgage notes payable of $105.0 million consist principally of fixed rate mortgage loan indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1% at October 31, 2008. The mortgage loans are secured by 11 properties with a net book value of $199 million and primarily have fixed rates of interest ranging from 5.09% to 7.78%. The Company made principal payments of $7.0 million (including the repayment of $5.3 million in mortgages that matured) in fiscal 2008 compared to $8.1 million (including the repayment of $5.7 million in mortgages that matured) in fiscal 2007 and $7.4 million (including the repayment of $5.0 million in mortgages that matured) in fiscal 2006. The Company may refinance its mortgage loans, at or prior to scheduled maturity, through replacement mortgage loans. The ability to do so, however, is dependent upon various factors, including the income level of the properties, interest rates and credit conditions within the commercial real estate market. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such refinancings can be achieved. In fiscal 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with a bank to extend the non-recourse mortgage note payable on the Ridgeway Shopping Center in Stamford, Connecticut with an outstanding principal balance of approximately $52.5 million for a 10-year term and reset the fixed interest rate from 7.54% to 5.52% commencing October 1, 2007. In February 2008, the Company entered into a new $50 Million Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Unsecured Facility”) with The Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo Bank N.A. The agreement gives the Company the option, under certain conditions, to increase the Facility’s borrowing capacity up to $100 million. The maturity date of the Unsecured Facility is February 11, 2011 with two one-year extensions at the Company’s option. Borrowings under the Unsecured Facility can be used for, among other things, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of other indebtedness and the issuance of letters of credit (up to $10 million). Borrowings bear interest at the Company’s option of Eurodollar plus 0.85% or The Bank of New York Mellon’s prime lending rate plus 0.50%. The Company pays an annual fee on the unused commitment amount of up to 0.175% based on outstanding borrowings during the year. The Unsecured Facility contains certain representations, financial and other covenants typical for this type of facility. The Company’s ability to borrow under the Unsecured Facility is subject to its compliance with the covenants and other restrictions on an ongoing basis. The principal financial covenants limit the Company’s level of secured and unsecured indebtedness and additionally require the Company to maintain certain debt coverage ratios. As of October 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with such covenants in the Unsecured Facility and in the Secured Facility discussed below. On April 15, 2008, the Company renewed its secured revolving credit facility with The Bank of New York Mellon (the “Secured Facility”) which provides for borrowings of up to $30 million for an additional three years to April 2011. The Secured Facility is collateralized by first mortgage liens on two of the Company’s properties. Interest on outstanding borrowings is at The Bank of New York Mellon’s prime lending rate plus 0.50% or Eurodollar plus 1.75%. The Secured Facility requires the Company to maintain certain debt service coverage ratios during its term. The Company pays an annual fee of 0.25% on the unused portion of the Secured Facility. The Secured Facility is available to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, mortgage repayments, working capital and other general corporate purposes. 22 Contractual Obligations The Company’s contractual payment obligations as of October 31, 2008 were as follows (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Mortgage notes payable $ 104,954 $ 17,182 $ 6,607 $ 13,291 $ 5,154 $ 4,449 $ 58,271 Tenant obligations* 1,186 1,186 - - - - - Total Contractual Obligations $ 106,140 $ 18,368 $ 6,607 $ 13,291 $ 5,154 $ 4,449 $ 58,271 *Committed tenant-related obligations based on executed leases as of October 31, 2008. The Company has various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to its property management. In addition, the Company also has certain other utility contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business which may extend beyond one year, which vary based on usage. These contracts include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. Contract terms are generally one year or less. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the years ended October 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. Capital Expenditures The Company invests in its existing properties and regularly incurs capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain its properties. The Company believes that such expenditures enhance the competitiveness of its properties. In fiscal 2008, the Company paid approximately $8.7 million for property improvements, tenant improvement and leasing commission costs. The amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly depending on tenant negotiations, market conditions and rental rates. The Company expects to incur approximately $3.5 million for anticipated capital and tenant improvements and leasing costs in fiscal 2009. These expenditures are expected to be funded from operating cash flows or bank borrowings. Acquisitions and Significant Property Transactions The Company seeks to acquire properties which are primarily shopping centers located in the northeastern part of the United States with a concentration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, Westchester and Putnam Counties, New York and Bergen County, New Jersey. In December 2007, the Company acquired a 20,000 square foot retail property located in Waldwick, New Jersey (Waldwick) for $6.3 million, including closing costs. The property is net-leased to a single tenant under a long-term lease arrangement. In February 2008, the Company acquired two retail properties, containing approximately 5,500 square feet of GLA in Westchester County, New York for a cash purchase price of $2.3 million, including closing costs. In April 2008, the Company through a subsidiary, which is the sole general partner, acquired a 60% interest in UB Ironbound, LP, (“Ironbound”), a newly formed limited partnership that acquired by contribution a 101,000 square foot shopping center in Newark, New Jersey (Ferry Plaza), valued at $26.3 million, including transaction costs of approximately $297,000 and the assumption of an existing first mortgage loan on the property at its estimated fair value of $11.9 million at a fixed interest rate of 6.15%. The Company’s net investment in Ironbound amounted to $8.6 million. The partnership agreement provides for the partners to receive an annual cash preference from available cash of the partnership. Any unpaid preferences accumulate and are paid from future available cash, if any. The general partner’s cash preferences are paid after the limited partner's preferences are satisfied. The balance of available cash, if any, is distributed in accordance with the respective partners' interests. Upon liquidation, proceeds from the sale of partnership assets are to be distributed in accordance with the respective partners' interests. The limited partner is not obligated to make any additional capital contributions to the partnership. Ironbound has a defined termination date of December 31, 2099. In August 2008, the Company acquired a 79,000 square foot shopping center in Litchfield County, Connecticut for a purchase price of $10.4 million, including the assumption of a first mortgage loan. The Company recorded the assumption of the mortgage loan at its estimated fair value which approximated $3.7 million. In May 2008, the Company paid a $750,000 deposit on a contract to purchase an equity interest in a joint venture which owns a 237,000 square foot shopping center in Westchester County, New York. In November 2008, the Company negotiated a termination of the contract and forfeited $150,000 of the contract deposit. The $150,000 plus capitalized acquisition costs in the amount of $66,000 have been expensed in the fiscal 2008 consolidated statement of income. 23 In October 2008, the Company paid a $500,000 deposit on a contract to purchase an office building in Greenwich, Connecticut. In November of 2008, the Company terminated the contract during the due diligence period and received its contract deposit back in December of 2008. In January 2007, the Company acquired a 10,100 square foot shopping center located in Monroe, Connecticut (“Monroe”) for $3.8 million, including closing costs. In April 2007, the Company acquired the Emerson Shopping Plaza (“Emerson”), a 92,000 square foot shopping center located in Emerson, New Jersey for a purchase price of approximately $17.5 million, including closing costs. In August 2007, the Company purchased all of the limited partner operating partnership units (OPU’s) in a consolidated partnership that owned The Shoppes at Eastchester, in Eastchester, New York for $2.8 million. Prior to the purchase, the Company was the sole general partner in the partnership. As a result of the purchase, the partnership terminated and the property is now directly owned by the Company. In January 2007, the Company entered into a lease with a wholesale club to lease approximately 107,000 square feet of space at The Dock Shopping Center, in Stratford, Connecticut, subject to certain conditions. In connection with the new lease, the Company agreed to provide up to $6.75 million toward the costs of redeveloping the space that previously had been occupied by a tenant who, in a prior year, filed a petition in bankruptcy and vacated the space. The former tenant’s lease obligation was guaranteed through 2016 by a corporate guarantor previously affiliated with the former tenant. In February 2007, the Company executed a settlement agreement with the guarantor whereby the guarantor was released from its obligations in exchange for a payment to the Company of $6 million that was received in fiscal 2007. In May 2007, the Company formed a limited liability company (“LLC”) to acquire by contribution a 20% economic interest in a general partnership which owns a retail/office property in Westchester County, New York. Simultaneously, the Company contributed one of its wholly-owned retail properties in Westchester County, New York into the LLC. As a result of the contributions, the Company owns approximately 76% of the LLC, the accounts of which are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at October 31, 2008. The Company has recorded the non-controlling member’s share of the net assets of the LLC of $546,000 in minority interests in the accompanying October 31, 2008 consolidated balance sheet. The Company has, among other things, guaranteed a preferential return to the other member of the LLC of approximately $38,000 per annum. In fiscal 2006, the Company acquired three retail properties totaling 50,000 square feet of GLA at an aggregate purchase price of $16.6 million. Sales of Properties In fiscal 2007, the Company sold its Tempe, Arizona property for a sale price of $13.2 million. The proceeds were used to complete the acquisition of the Emerson, New Jersey property. The Company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $11.4 million in fiscal 2007. There were no sales in fiscal 2008. Non-Core Properties In a prior year, the Company's Board of Directors expanded and refined the strategic objectives of the Company to refocus its real estate portfolio into one of self-managed retail properties located in the northeast and authorized the sale of the Company’s non-core properties in the normal course of business over a period of several years. The non-core properties consist of two distribution service facilities (both of which are located outside of the northeast region of the United States). The Company intends to sell its remaining non-core properties as opportunities become available. The Company’s ability to generate cash from asset sales is dependent upon market conditions and will be limited if market conditions make such sales unattractive. In fiscal 2007, the Company sold its Tempe, Arizona property, a non-core property, for $13.2 million and recorded a gain on sale of the property of $11.4 million. There were no sales of non-core properties in fiscal 2008. At October 31, 2008, the two remaining non-core properties have a net book value of approximately $630,000. Funds from Operations The Company considers Funds from Operations (“FFO”) to be an additional measure of an equity REIT’s operating performance. The Company reports FFO in addition to its net income applicable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities. Management has adopted the definition suggested by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and defines FFO to mean net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)) excluding gains or losses from sales of property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Management considers FFO a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of its real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. FFO is presented to assist investors in analyzing the performance of the Company. It is helpful as it excludes various items included in net income that are not indicative of the Company’s operating performance, such as gains (or losses) from sales of property and deprecation and amortization. 24 However, FFO: § does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income); and § should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company’s performance. FFO as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other real estate investment trusts due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. The table below provides a reconciliation of net income applicable to Common and Class A Common Stockholders in accordance with GAAP to FFO for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2008 (amounts in thousands). Year Ended October 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net Income Applicable to Common and Class A Common Stockholders $ 16,147 $ 35,046 $ 15,690 Plus: Real property depreciation 10,966 10,530 9,981 Amortization of tenant improvements and allowances 2,822 2,267 2,450 Amortization of deferred leasing costs 509 564 557 Depreciation and amortization on discontinued operations - 40 170 Less: Gains on sales of properties - (11,385 ) - Funds from Operations Applicable to Common and Class A Common Stockholders $ 30,444 $ 37,062 $ 28,848 Net Cash Provided by (Used in): Operating Activities $ 44,997 $ 49,307 $ 35,429 Investing Activities $ (33,694 ) $ (19,457 ) $ (20,129 ) Financing Activities $ (13,857 ) $ (28,432 ) $ (38,994 ) FFO amounted to $30.4 million in fiscal 2008 compared to $37.1 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $28.8 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease in FFO in fiscal 2008, when compared with fiscal 2007, is attributable, among other things, to: a) the one-time receipt of a settlement of a lease guarantee obligation in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 in the amount of $6 million, b) an increase in general and administrative expenses, c) an increase in preferred stock dividends in fiscal 2008 as a result of the Company’s $60 million preferred stock sale in March 2008, d) the one-time expense of offering costs, which were deferred by the Company, on the redemption of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and e) a decrease in other income; offset by f) an increase in operating income as a result of property acquisitions in fiscal 2007 and 2008 and g) a decrease in interest expense principally from the mortgage refinancing of one of the Company’s properties at a lower interest rate in October 2007. The increase in FFO in fiscal 2007 when compared with fiscal 2006 reflects an increase in operating income from properties owned during the period and property acquisitions in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 and the receipt of $6 million from the settlement of a lease guarantee on a tenant space in The Dock shopping center in Stratford, Connecticut. See more detailed explanations which follow. 25 Results of Operations Fiscal 2008 vs. Fiscal 2007 The following information summarizes the Company’s results of operations for the year ended October 31, 2008 and 2007 (amounts in thousands): Year Ended October 31, Change Attributable to: Revenues 2008 2007 Increase (Decrease) % Change Property Acquisitions Properties Held In Both Periods Base rents $ 61,008 $ 57,260 $ 3,748 6.5 % $ 2,276 $ 1,472 Recoveries from tenants 18,938 17,660 1,278 7.2 % 620 658 Mortgage interest and other 849 845 4 0.5 % 2 2 Operating Expenses Property operating 12,937 12,109 828 6.8 % 747 81 Property taxes 12,059 10,926 1,133 10.4 % 455 678 Depreciation and amortization 14,374 13,442 932 6.9 % 656 276 General and administrative 5,853 4,979 874 17.6 % n/a n/a Non-Operating Income/Expense Interest expense 7,012 7,773 (761 ) (9.8 %) 441 (1,202 ) Interest, dividends, and other investment income 318 501 (183 ) (36.7 %) n/a n/a Revenues Base rents increased by 6.5% to $61.0 million in fiscal 2008 as compared with $57.3 million in the comparable period of 2007. The increase in base rentals during each period was attributable to: Property Acquisitions: In fiscal 2008, the Company purchased or acquired interests in five properties totaling 205,500 square feet of GLA (compared to two retail properties totaling 102,100 square feet of GLA acquired in fiscal 2007). These properties accounted for all of the revenue and expense changes attributable to property acquisitions during the fiscal year ended 2008. Properties Held in Both Periods: The increase in base rents for properties held in both periods during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2007 reflects an increase in rental rates for in-place leases and new leases entered into over the periods offset by an increase in vacancies occurring during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 at several of the Company’s core properties. During fiscal 2008, the Company leased or renewed approximately 303,000 square feet (or approximately 8.0% of total property leasable area) at an approximate rental rate increase of 11%. At October 31, 2008, the Company’s core properties were approximately 94% leased. The overall core property occupancy rate decreased from 95.4% at October 31, 2007 to 92.7% at October 31, 2008. For the fiscal year ended 2008, recoveries from tenants for properties owned in both periods (which represents reimbursements from tenants for operating expenses and property taxes) increased by $658,000 when compared to the same period in fiscal 2007. The increase was a result of an increase in property tax expense recoverable from tenants for the period when compared to the corresponding period of the prior year caused by an approximate 6.3% increase in property tax expense in properties held in both periods. Recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance were relatively unchanged in fiscal 2008 when compared with fiscal 2007. The Company’s single largest real estate investment is the Ridgeway Shopping Center located in Stamford, Connecticut (which is owned by a consolidated joint venture in which the Company has a 90% controlling interest). Ridgeway’s revenues represented approximately $12.0 million or 15% of total revenues in fiscal 2008 compared to $11.0 million or 14.0% of total revenues in fiscal 2007. At October 31, 2008, the property was approximately 99% leased. No other property in the Company’s portfolio comprised more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008. 26 Operating Expenses Operating expense increases were a result of property acquisitions as discussed above and properties held in both periods as more fully discussed below: Property operating expenses for properties held in both periods were relatively unchanged in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008 when compared to fiscal 2007. Property taxes for properties held in both periods increased by $678,000 or 6.3% in fiscal 2008 from higher real estate tax assessment rates at some of the Company’s properties. Depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of depreciation on the two properties acquired in fiscal 2007 and the five properties purchased in fiscal 2008. General and administrative expenses increased by $874,000 in fiscal 2008 compared fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation costs, professional fees of $276,000 and employment placement fees of $79,000. Non-Operating Income/Expense Interest, dividends and other investment income decreased by $183,000 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. This decrease is a result of the use of available cash in 2008 primarily for property acquisitions as well as the repurchase of Class A Common Stock under the Company’s share repurchase program. Interest expense decreased $761,000 in fiscal 2008 when compared to fiscal 2007 as a result of scheduled principal payments on mortgage notes, the refinancing of an approximately $53 million mortgage at the Company’s Ridgeway property at a lower rate of interest in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the repayment of mortgage notes of $5.7 million during 2007.

Property Acquisitions: In fiscal 2007, the Company acquired two properties totaling 102,100 square feet of GLA (compared with three properties totaling 50,000 square feet of GLA in Fiscal 2006). These properties accounted for all of the revenue, operating expense, property tax, and depreciation and amortization changes attributable to property acquisitions during the fiscal year ended 2007.
