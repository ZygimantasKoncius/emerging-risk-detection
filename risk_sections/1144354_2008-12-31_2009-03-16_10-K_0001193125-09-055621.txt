ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings before you decide whether to buy our common stock. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock. Risks Relating to Our Business Unauthorized disclosure of merchant and cardholder data, whether through breach of our computer systems (such as the Processing System Intrusion) or otherwise, could expose us to liability and protracted and costly litigation. On January 20, 2009, we announced the Processing System Intrusion, which apparently had occurred during some portion of 2008. The Processing System Intrusion involved malicious software that appears to have been used to collect in-transit, unencrypted payment card data while it was being processed by us during the transaction authorization process. Such data is not required to be encrypted while in transit under current payment card industry guidelines. Card data that was affected by the Processing System Intrusion included card numbers, expiration dates, and certain other information from the magnetic stripe on the back of the payment card (including, for a small percentage of transactions, the cardholders name). Although, we have taken a number of steps to contain the Processing System Intrusion and to further enhance the security of our computer system. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer an additional security breach in the future. 31 Table of Contents The Processing System Intrusion has resulted in numerous lawsuits having been filed against us and will likely result in additional lawsuits against us in the future. Several government agencies have either made inquiries to us or initiated investigations of us related to Processing System Intrusion. For more information concerning these lawsuits and government inquiries and investigations, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We expect that the Card Brands will assert claims seeking to impose fines, penalties, and/or other assessments against us or our sponsor banks (who would seek indemnification from us pursuant to our agreements with them) based upon the Processing System Intrusion. By these claims, we expect the Card Brands to seek to recover from us, or from our sponsor banks (who would in turn seek to recover from us), assessments in respect of fraud losses and operating expenses (including card reissuance costs and non-ordinary-course account monitoring expenses) that the Card Brands believe either themselves or their issuers to have incurred by reason of the Processing System Intrusion, as well as fines and/or penalties by reason of our alleged failure to comply with the Card Brands operating regulations. The amounts of the claims we expect to be asserted by the Card Brands and amounts we may be required to pay as a result of, or in order to defend, the lawsuits, Card Brand claims, and government investigations and inquiries described above is likely to be substantial. It is possible that the amounts required to resolve and defend the claims by the card brands and these lawsuits and government inquiries and investigations could exceed our ability to pay such amounts from our cash flow and we may be required to seek financing to make such payments. Given the current state of the financial markets and the impact the Processing System Intrusion may have on our business and financial condition, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on reasonable terms or at all. We collect and store sensitive data about merchants, including names, addresses, social security numbers, drivers license numbers and checking account numbers. In addition, we maintain a database of cardholder data relating to specific transactions, including bank card numbers, in order to process the transactions and for fraud prevention. Any loss of cardholder data by us or our merchants could result in significant fines and sanctions by Visa, MasterCard or governmental bodies, which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial position and/or results of operations. In addition, a significant breach could result in our being prohibited from processing transactions for Visa and MasterCard. Our computer systems have been, and could in the future, be subject to penetration by hackers and our encryption of data may not prevent unauthorized use. In this event, we may be subject to liability, including claims for unauthorized purchases with misappropriated bank card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. We could also be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information, such as unauthorized marketing purposes. These claims also could result in protracted and costly litigation. In addition, we could be subject to penalties or sanctions from the Visa and MasterCard networks. Although we generally require that our agreements with our service providers who have access to merchant and customer data include confidentiality obligations that restrict these parties from using or disclosing any customer or merchant data except as necessary to perform their services under the applicable agreements, we cannot assure you that these contractual measures will prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of data. In addition, our agreements with financial institutions require us to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of merchant and consumer data. Any failure to adequately enforce these protective measures could result in protracted and costly litigation. If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the Visa and MasterCard bank card networks, Visa or MasterCard could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations. Fines could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, and if these registrations are terminated, we will not be able to conduct our business. If we are unable to comply with Visa and MasterCard bank card network requirements, Visa or MasterCard could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations. On occasion, we have received notices of non-compliance and fines, which have typically related to excessive chargebacks by a merchant or data security failures on the part of a merchant. If we are unable to recover fines from our merchants, we would experience a financial loss. The termination of our registration, or any changes in the Visa or MasterCard rules that would impair our registration, could require us to stop providing Visa and MasterCard payment processing services, which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business. We have been advised by Visa that, based on Visas investigation of the Processing System Intrusion, Visa believes we are in violation of the Visa operating regulations and that, based on that belief, Visa has removed us from Visas published list of PCI-DSS compliant service providers until such time as we are re-certified as PCI-DSS compliant and the assessors report attesting to such re-certification has been reviewed and approved by Visa, intends to seek to impose fines on our sponsor banks, which fines (if successfully imposed) our sponsor banks could in turn seek to recover from us, intends to place us in a probationary status during the two years following our re-certification as being PCI-DSS compliant, during which time our failure to comply with the probationary requirements set forth by Visa or with the Visa operating regulations may result in Visa seeking to impose further risk conditions on us, including but not limited to our disconnection from VisaNet or our disqualification from the Visa payment system, and intends to treat some or all of the Visa accounts that Visa considers to have been placed at risk of compromise in the Processing System Intrusion as being eligible for Visas Account Data Compromise Recovery and Data Compromise Recovery Solution processes, which processes could result in Visas seeking to recover from our sponsor banks (and our sponsor banks in turn seeking to recover from us) amounts in respect of fraud losses and operating expenses that Visa believes Visa issuers to have incurred by reason of the Processing System Intrusion. We are subject to the business cycles and credit risk of our merchants, which could negatively impact our financial results. A recessionary economic environment could have a negative impact on our merchants, which could, in turn, negatively impact our financial results, particularly if the recessionary environment disproportionately affects some of the market segments that represent a larger portion of our bank card processing volume, like restaurants. If our merchants make fewer sales of their products and services, we will have fewer transactions to process, resulting in lower revenue. In addition, we have a certain amount of fixed and semi-fixed costs, including rent, processing contractual minimums and salaries, which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy. In a recessionary environment our merchants could also experience a higher rate of business closures, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. During the recession prior to the current recession, we experienced a slowdown in the rate of same-store sales growth and an increase in business closures. During the current recession, we have for the first time experienced a reduction in same-store sales when compared to last year, and we could experience a higher rate of merchant closures. In the event of a closure of a merchant, we are unlikely to receive our fees for any transactions processed by that merchant in its final month of operation. While we service a broad range of merchants, restaurants represent a significant portion of our merchant base. The failure rate of restaurants is typically high, which increases our merchant attrition and reject losses. A reduction in consumer spending, particularly at restaurants, would further increase our rate of merchant attrition and reject losses. 32 Table of Contents The payment processing industry is highly competitive and we compete with certain firms that are larger and that have greater financial resources. Such competition could increase, which would adversely influence our prices to merchants, and as a result, our operating margins. The market for payment processing services is highly competitive. Other providers of payment processing services have established a sizable market share in the small- and medium-size merchant processing sector. Maintaining our historic growth will depend on a combination of the continued growth in electronic payment transactions and our ability to increase our market share. The current recession could cause future growth in electronic payment transactions to slow compared to historical rates of growth and the Processing System Intrusion could negatively impact our ability to increase our market share. According to The Nilson Report, we accounted for approximately 2.4% of the 2.1 trillion of total purchase volume (which we refer to as bank card processing volume) processed by all bank card acquirers in 2007. This competition may influence the prices we are able to charge. If the competition causes us to reduce the prices we charge, we will have to aggressively control our costs in order to maintain acceptable profit margins. In addition, some of our competitors are financial institutions, subsidiaries of financial institutions or well-established payment processing companies, including First Data Corporation, Bank of America Corporation, Global Payments, Inc., Fifth Third Bank, Chase Paymentech Solutions and Elavon, Inc., a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp. Our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a bank for registration with the card networks and can settle transactions more quickly for their merchants than we can for ours. These competitors have substantially greater financial, technology, management and marketing resources than we have. This may allow our competitors to offer more attractive fees to our current and prospective merchants, or other products or services that we do not offer. This could result in a loss of customers, greater difficulty attracting new customers, and a reduction in the price we can charge for our services. We have faced, and will in the future face, chargeback liability when our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers, and reject losses when our merchants go out of business. We cannot accurately anticipate these liabilities, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In the event a billing dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant, the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. If we or our clearing banks are unable to collect such amounts from the merchants account, or if the merchant refuses or is unable, due to closure, bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us for the chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. The risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment. We may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future. Any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Reject losses arise from the fact that we collect our fees from our SME merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period. This results in the build-up of a substantial receivable from our customers, which significantly exceeds the receivables of any of our competitors which assess their fees on a daily basis. If a merchant has gone out of business during the billing period, we may be unable to collect such fees. In addition, if our sponsor bank is unable, due to system disruption or other failure, to collect our fees from our merchants, we would face a substantial loss. We incurred charges relating to chargebacks and reject losses of $5.3 million, $2.8 million and $1.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We have faced, and will in the future face, merchant fraud, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We have potential liability for fraudulent bank card transactions initiated by merchants. Merchant fraud occurs when a merchant knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit bank card or card number to record a false sales transaction, processes an invalid bank card or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. Examples of merchant fraud we have faced include a manager of a franchised motel who applied for a merchant account that proved to be a second account for that motel, and processed duplicate charges in his office, and an antique repair service owner who continued accepting deposits on cards for repairs, but stopped doing the repairs. We have established systems and procedures designed to detect and reduce the impact of merchant fraud, but we cannot assure you that these measures are or will be effective. It is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future. Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud would increase our chargeback liability. Increases in chargebacks could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our actual losses and costs to mitigate the Processing System Intrusion could be a material amount, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow. While we have determined that the Processing System Intrusion has triggered a loss contingency, to date an unfavorable outcome is not believed by us to be probable on those claims that are pending or have been threatened against us, or that we consider to be probable of assertion against us, and we do not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the loss we would incur in the event of an unfavorable outcome on any such claim. Therefore, in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, no reserve/liability has been recorded with respect to any such claim as of December 31, 2008. As more information becomes available, if we should determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable on such a claim and that the amount of such unfavorable outcome is reasonably estimable, we will record a reserve for the claim in question. If and when we record such a reserve, it could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Costs we incurred related to investigations and remedial actions performed in December 2008 were not significant. Amounts we expect to incur for investigations, remedial actions, legal fees, and crisis management services related to the Processing System Intrusion that will be performed after December 31, 2008 will be recognized as incurred. Such costs could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. 33 Table of Contents If publicity surrounding the Processing System Intrusion and the efforts of our competitors to capitalize on the Processing System Intrusion have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain new customers and retain existing customers, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow would experience a material adverse impact. The Processing System Intrusion has resulted in significant negative publicity and we believe that our competitors are using the occurrence of the Processing System Intrusion and the attendant negative publicity to compete against us for merchants. It is possible that publicity surrounding the Processing System Intrusion and the efforts of our competitors to capitalize on the Processing System Intrusion could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain new merchant customers and retain existing merchant customers which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Increased merchant attrition that we cannot offset with increased bank card processing volume or new accounts would cause our revenues to decline. We experience attrition in merchant bank card processing volume resulting from several factors, including business closures, transfers of merchants accounts to our competitors and account closures that we initiate due to heightened credit risks relating to, or contract breaches by, merchants, and when applicable same store sales contraction. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we experienced average annual attrition of 17.3%, 12.6%, and 11.1% respectively. Substantially all of our processing contracts may be terminated by either party on relatively short notice. We cannot predict the level of attrition in the future, and it could increase. Increased attrition in merchant bank card processing volume may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to establish accounts with new merchants or otherwise increase our bank card processing volume in order to counter the effect of this attrition, our revenues will decline. We rely on sponsor banks, which have substantial discretion with respect to certain elements of our business practices, in order to process bank card transactions. If these sponsorships are terminated and we are unable to secure new bank sponsors, we will not be able to conduct our business. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from Visa and MasterCard bank card transactions. Because we are not a bank, we are not eligible for membership in the Visa and MasterCard networks and are, therefore, unable to directly access the bank card networks, which are required to process Visa and MasterCard transactions. Visa and MasterCard operating regulations require us to be sponsored by a bank in order to process bank card transactions. We are currently registered with Visa and MasterCard through KeyBank, which has maintained that registration since 1999, Heartland Bank, which has been a sponsor since December 2007, and SunTrust Bank, which has been a sponsor since August 2008 (but only started processing in February 2009). If our sponsorships are terminated and we are unable to secure another bank sponsor or sponsors, we will not be able to process Visa and MasterCard transactions. Furthermore, our agreements with KeyBank and Heartland Bank give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for merchants, the terms of our agreements with merchants and our customer service levels. Our sponsor banks discretionary actions under these agreements could be detrimental to our operations. It is possible that our sponsor banks could claim that the Processing System Intrusion gives them the right to terminate our agreements with them. 34 Table of Contents Current or future bank card network rules and practices could adversely affect our business. We are registered with the Visa and MasterCard networks through our bank sponsor as an Independent Sales Organization with Visa and a Member Service Provider with MasterCard. We are currently a sales agent for Discover and American Express. Under the new American Express agreement we will remain a sales agent however, under the new Discover agreement we will be registered as an Acquirer. The rules of the bank card networks are set by their boards, which may be strongly influenced by member banks and, in the case of Discover and American Express, by the card issuers, and some of those banks and issuers are our competitors with respect to these processing services. Many banks directly or indirectly sell processing services to merchants in direct competition with us. These banks could attempt, by virtue of their membership in the network, to alter the networks rules or policies to the detriment of non-members like us. The bank card networks or issuers who maintain our registrations or arrangements or the current bank card network or issuer rules allowing us to market and provide payment processing services may not remain in effect. The termination of our registration or our status as an Independent Sales Organization or Member Service Provider, or any changes in card network or issuer rules that limit our ability to provide payment processing services, could have an adverse effect on our bank card processing volumes, revenues or operating costs. In addition, if we were precluded from processing Visa and MasterCard bank card transactions, we would lose substantially all of our revenues. Our systems and our third-party providers systems may fail due to factors beyond our control, which could interrupt our service, cause us to lose business and increase our costs. We depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems, software, data center and telecommunications networks, as well as the systems of third parties. Our systems and operations or those of our third-party providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from, among other things, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry and computer viruses. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur. Defects in our systems or those of third parties, errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions, telecommunications failures or other difficulties could result in:  loss of revenues;  loss of merchants, although our contracts with merchants do not expressly provide a right to terminate for business interruptions;  loss of merchant and cardholder data;  harm to our business or reputation;  exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities;  negative publicity;  additional operating and development costs; and/or  diversion of technical and other resources. Adverse conditions in markets in which we obtain a substantial amount of our bank card processing volume, such as our largest SME merchant markets of California, New York, Texas, Florida, Colorado, and New Jersey, could negatively affect our results of operations. Adverse economic or other conditions in California, New York, Texas, Florida, Colorado, and New Jersey would negatively affect our revenue and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In December 2008, SME merchants in California represented 12.3%, in New York represented 6.6%, in Texas represented 5.3%, in Florida represented 4.5%, in New Jersey represented 4.4%, and in Colorado represented 4.1% of our SME bank card processing volume. As a result of this geographic concentration of our merchants in these markets, we are exposed to the risks of downturns in these local economies and to other local conditions, which could adversely affect the operating results of our merchants in these markets. No other state represented more than 4% of our SME bank card processing volume in December 2008. 35 Table of Contents If we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow, our business could be adversely affected. We are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of our key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, the rapidly changing payment processing industry and the selected markets in which we offer our services. It is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of our senior executives or key managers, particularly Robert O. Carr, our Chief Executive Officer, would have an adverse effect on our operations. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, manage and retain other qualified middle management and technical and clerical personnel as we grow. We may not continue to attract or retain such personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified sales people, our business and financial results may suffer. Unlike many of our competitors who rely on Independent Sales Organizations or salaried salespeople and telemarketers, we rely on a direct sales force whose compensation is entirely commission-based. Through our direct sales force of approximately 1,166 Relationship Managers, we seek to increase the number of merchants using our products and services. We intend to significantly increase the size of our sales force. Our success partially depends on the skill and experience of our sales force. If we are unable to retain and attract sufficiently experienced and capable Relationship Managers, our business and financial results may suffer. If we cannot pass increases in bank card network interchange fees along to our merchants, our operating margins will be reduced. We pay interchange fees and other network fees set by the bank card networks to the card issuing bank for each transaction we process involving their bank cards. From time to time, the bank card networks increase the interchange fees and other network fees that they charge payment processors and the sponsoring banks. At its sole discretion, our sponsoring bank has the right to pass any increases in interchange fees on to us and it has consistently done so in the past. We are allowed to, and in the past we have been able to, pass these fee increases along to our merchants through corresponding increases in our processing fees. However, if we are unable to do so in the future, our operating margins will be reduced. Any acquisitions or portfolio buyouts that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition. We expect to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies. We may not be able to successfully finance or integrate any businesses, products or technologies that we acquire. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition may divert managements time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. We may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenue. To the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock, it could be dilutive to our stockholders. While we from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions. We also regularly buy out the residual commissions of our Relationship Managers and sales managers, at multiples that typically amount to 2 to 2 1/2 years of such commissions. If the merchants included in the portfolios we purchase do not generate sufficient incremental margin after the purchase, we will not achieve a positive return on the cash expended. 36 Table of Contents Governmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to consumer information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services to merchants. Governmental bodies in the United States and abroad have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations restricting the transfer of, and safeguarding, non-public personal information. For example, in the United States, all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to ensure the privacy and security of consumer financial information. While our operations are subject to certain provisions of these privacy laws, we have limited our use of consumer information solely to providing services to other businesses and financial institutions. We limit sharing of non-public personal information to that necessary to complete the transactions on behalf of the consumer and the merchant and to that permitted by federal and state laws. In connection with providing services to the merchants and financial institutions that use our services, we are required by regulations and contracts with our merchants to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer information. These contracts require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards and best practices established by regulatory guidelines. The compliance standards relate to our infrastructure, components, and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer personal information shared by our clients with us. Our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future. The cost of such systems and procedures may increase in the future and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other similarly situated service providers. Our operating results are subject to seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly net income. We have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns. Historically our revenues have been strongest in our second and third quarters, and weakest in our first quarter. We may become subject to additional U.S., state or local taxes that cannot be passed through to our merchants, which could negatively affect our results of operations. Companies in the payment processing industry, including us, may become subject to taxation in various tax jurisdictions on our net income or revenues. Application of these taxes is an emerging issue in our industry and taxing jurisdictions have not yet adopted uniform positions on this topic. If we are required to pay additional taxes and are unable to pass the tax expense through to our merchants, our costs would increase and our net income would be reduced. We may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs, which may prevent us from growing our business. We may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs, including funding costs associated with the Processing System Intrusion, completing the build out of our new service center, developing new products and technology, and operating expenses. We may need additional financing earlier than we anticipate if we:  experience material costs to mitigate the impacts of, and resolve the claims originating from, the Processing System Intrusion;  expand faster than our internally generated cash flow can support;  purchase portfolio equity (the portion of our commissions that we have committed to our sales force for as long as the merchant processes with us, which we may buy out at an agreed multiple) from a large number of Relationship Managers or sales managers;  add new merchant accounts faster than expected;  need to reduce pricing in response to competition;  repurchase our common stock; or  acquire complementary products, businesses or technologies. If we raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities, these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock. We may also decide to issue securities, including debt securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. We may be unable to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all. If financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our future needs. This may prevent us from increasing our market share, capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry. 37 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Company Borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement could adversely affect our financial condition, and the related debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow and ability to invest in and grow our businesses. We funded our acquisition of Network Services by borrowing under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The interest rates on this debt are floating based on the LIBOR rate; accordingly, if the LIBOR rate increases, our interest expense would be higher. We intend to fulfill our total debt service obligations primarily from cash generated by our operations. Such funds will not be available to use in future operations, or investing in our businesses. This may adversely impact our ability to expand our businesses or make other investments. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations, to seek additional equity financing or to sell assets, which we may not be able to do on satisfactory terms or at all. As a result, we could default on those obligations and in the event of such default, our lenders could accelerate our debt or take other actions that could restrict our operations. If we incur significant costs to defend, or are required to book a significant reserve for, claims arising out of the Processing System Intrusion, such costs or reserve could cause us to violate certain of the financial covenants in our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, could depress our stock price. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities. At December 31, 2008, we had 37,675,543 shares of our common stock outstanding. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding options to purchase a total of 5,308,173 shares under our 2008 Incentive Stock Option Plan and our 2000 Incentive Stock Option Plan, of which 2,358,443 were vested. Assuming the exercise of all outstanding options to acquire our common stock, our current stockholders would own on a fully-diluted basis 87.7% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and the number of shares of our common stock available to trade could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition to the adverse effect a price decline could have on holders of our common stock, such a decline could impede our ability to raise capital or to make acquisitions through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities. Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage a takeover that our shareholders may consider favorable or could cause current management to become entrenched and difficult to replace. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, in our bylaws and under Delaware law could make it more difficult for other companies to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain the following provisions, among others, which may inhibit an acquisition of our company by a third party:  advance notification procedures for matters to be brought before stockholder meetings; 38 Table of Contents  a limitation on who may call stockholder meetings;  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; and  the ability of our Board of Directors to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock without a stockholder vote. If any shares of preferred stock are issued that contain an extraordinary dividend or special voting power, a change in control could be impeded. We are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder, meaning, generally, that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our Board of Directors. Any of these restrictions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. We may be unable or we may decide not to pay dividends on our common stock at a level anticipated by shareholders, which could depress our stock price. The payment of dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other factors, our earnings, stockholders equity, cash position and financial condition. No assurance can be given that we will be able to or will choose to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not Applicable.
