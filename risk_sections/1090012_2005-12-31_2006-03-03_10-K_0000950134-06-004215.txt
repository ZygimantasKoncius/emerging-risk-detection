Item 1A. Risk Factors. As a result, we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves. Our policies regarding booking reserves require proved reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and guidance, and assign responsibilities for reserves bookings to our Reserve Evaluation Group (the Group). The policies also require that reserve estimates be made by qualified reserves estimators (QREs), as defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers standards. A list of QREs is kept by the Senior Advisor  Corporate Reserves. All QREs are required to receive education covering the fundamentals of SEC proved reserves assignments. The Group is responsible for internal reserves evaluation and certification and includes the Manager  E&P Budgets and Reserves and the Senior Advisor  Corporate Reserves. The Group reports independently of any of our operating divisions. The Vice President  Planning and Evaluation is directly responsible for overseeing the Group and reports to the President of Devon. No portion of the Groups compensation is dependent on the quantity of reserves booked. Throughout the year, the Group performs internal audits of each operating divisions reserves. Selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major changes (additions and 16 Table of Contents revisions) to reserves. In addition, the Group reviews reserve estimates with each of the third-party petroleum consultants as discussed below. In addition to internal audits, we engage three independent petroleum consulting firms to perform both external reserves preparation and audits. Ryder Scott Company, L.P. prepared the reserves estimates for all offshore Gulf of Mexico properties and for 98% of the international proved reserves. LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. audited the reserves estimates for 87% of the domestic onshore properties. AJM Petroleum Consultants prepared estimates covering 46% of our Canadian reserves and audited an additional 26% of our Canadian reserves. Set forth below is a summary of the reserves which were evaluated, either by preparation or audit, by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003. 2005 2004 2003 Prepared Audited Prepared Audited Prepared Audited Domestic 9 % 79 % 16 % 61 % 33 % 37 % Canada 46 % 26 % 22 %  28 %  International 98 %  98 %  98 %  Total 31 % 54 % 28 % 35 % 42 % 21 % Prepared reserves are those estimates of quantities of reserves which were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant. Audited reserves are those quantities of reserves which were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant. An audit is an examination of a companys proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates, in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. We follow what we believe to be a rational approach not only to recording oil and gas reserves, but also to subjecting these reserves to reviews by independent petroleum consultants. In 2004 and 2003, 63% of our company-wide reserves were prepared or audited by an independent petroleum consulting firm. In 2005, 85% of our company-wide reserves were prepared or audited by an independent petroleum consulting firm. We expect the 2005 percent to be indicative of the coverage provided by independent reviews in 2006. This approach provides a high degree of assurance about the validity of our reserve estimates. This is evidenced by the fact that in the past five years, our annual performance related revisions to our reserve estimates, which have been both increases and decreases in individual years, have averaged approximately 1% of the previous years estimate. In addition to internal and external reviews, three independent members of our Board of Directors have been assigned to a Reserves Committee. The Reserves Committee meets at lease twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and periodically meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our independent petroleum consultants. The Reserves Committee assists the Board of Directors with the oversight of the following:  the annual review and evaluation of our consolidated oil, gas and NGL reserves;  the integrity of our reserves evaluation and reporting system;  our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to reserves evaluation, preparation, and disclosure;  the qualifications and independence of our independent engineering consultants; and  our business practices and ethical standards in relation to the preparation and disclosure of reserves. 17 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves and the related estimated pre-tax future net revenues, pre-tax 10% present value and after-tax standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of December 31, 2005.

NGL reserves are converted to Boe on a one-to-one basis with oil. 18 Table of Contents (2) Estimated future net revenue represents estimated future revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and development costs and site restoration and abandonment charges. The amounts shown do not give effect to non-property related expenses such as debt service and future income tax expense or to depreciation, depletion and amortization. These amounts were calculated using prices and costs in effect for each individual property as of December 31, 2005. These prices were not changed except where different prices were fixed and determinable from applicable contracts. These assumptions yield average prices over the life of our properties of $45.50 per Bbl of oil, $7.84 per Mcf of natural gas and $32.46 per Bbl of NGLs. These prices compare to the December 31, 2005, NYMEX price of $61.04 per Bbl for crude oil and the Henry Hub spot price of $10.08 per MMBtu for natural gas. We believe the pre-tax 10% present value is a useful measure in addition to standardized measure as it assists in both the determination of future cash flows of the current reserves as well as in making relative value comparisons among peer companies. The standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company, while the pre-tax 10% present value is based on prices and discount factors which are consistent from company to company. We also understand that securities analysts use this measure in similar ways. (3) See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. As presented in the previous table, we had 1,599 MMBoe of proved developed reserves at December 31, 2005. Proved developed reserves consist of proved developed producing reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves. The following table provides additional information regarding our proved developed reserves at December 31, 2005.

Reserve estimates filed with the SEC correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein. Reserve estimates filed with the DOE are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included herein. However, the DOE requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate. The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil, gas and NGL production subsequent to December 31, 2005. There can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated, that the assumed prices will be realized or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced. Production, Revenue and Price History Certain information concerning oil, natural gas and NGL production, prices, revenues (net of all royalties, overriding royalties and other third party interests) and operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2005, is set forth in Item 7.

Operation of Properties The day-to-day operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements. The operator supervises production, maintains production records, employs field personnel and performs other functions. We are the operator of 18,784 of our wells. As operator, we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of our duties as well as monthly per-well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area. In presenting our financial data, we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense, which is a common industry practice. Organization Structure Our North American properties are concentrated within five geographic areas. Operations in the United States are focused in the Permian Basin, the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains and onshore and offshore Gulf Coast regions. Canadian properties are focused in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British Columbia. Properties outside North America are located primarily in Azerbaijan, China, Egypt and areas in West Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Cote dIvoire. Additionally, we have exploratory interests, but no current producing assets, in other international countries including Angola, Brazil, Ghana and Nigeria. Maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core areas has allowed us to improve operating and capital efficiency. The following table sets forth proved reserve information on the most significant geographic areas in which our properties are located as of December 31, 2005.
