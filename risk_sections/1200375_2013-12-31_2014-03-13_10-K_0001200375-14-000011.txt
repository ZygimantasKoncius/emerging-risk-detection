ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Risks Relating to Our Business and Strategy We have a limited operating history and have recently experienced significant changes to our business, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance. Our company has been in existence since January 2002. From 2002 until 2005, our operations focused on organizing and staffing our company and developing our technology platform. In 2005, we recognized our first revenues from product sales. Since 2005, we have continued to generate revenues, but because our revenue growth has occurred in recent periods, our limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance. Additionally, from 2006 to August 2012, a major portion of our business revolved around our research and development collaboration with Shell with respect to advanced biofuels, and the collaboration accounted for 0%, 51% and 51% of our revenues in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Upon the termination of the Shell collaboration in August 2012, we undertook a significant restructuring of our operations as a result and refocused our business on the biocatalysis market. In November 2013, we announced that we had immediately begun to wind down our CodeXyme® cellulase enzymes program, and that we had stopped further development of our CodeXol® detergent alcohols program in the third quarter of 2013. As a result of these changes in our business and any changes to our business focus that we may make as we move forward, our operating history in 14Table of Contentspast periods may not provide much of a basis to evaluate our current business or predict our future performance. Any assessments of our current business and predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or if we had not experienced significant changes to our business. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by young companies in rapidly changing industries. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business will be harmed. Our quarterly or annual operating results may fluctuate in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline. Our financial condition and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following factors, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report: •our ability to achieve or maintain profitability; •our ability to obtain substantial additional capital that may be necessary to expand our business; •our dependence on a limited number of customers; •our ability to develop and successfully commercialize new products for the biocatalysis market(s);•charges to earnings as a result of any impairment of goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets;•our ability to realize the expected benefits from the corporate restructuring we undertook in November 2013; •our customers' ability to timely pay amounts owed to us;•our dependence on a limited number of products in our pharmaceutical business; •our ability to maintain internal control over financial reporting; •our reliance on one contract manufacturer for commercial scale production of substantially all of our enzymes; •our relationships with, and dependence on, collaborators in our principal markets; •our ability to deploy our technology platform in the fine chemicals markets; •our dependence on, and the need to attract and retain key management and other personnel; •the success of our customers' pharmaceutical products in the market and the ability of such customers to obtain regulatory approvals for products and processes; •our ability to control and to improve pharmaceutical product gross margins; •our exposure to potential third party claims resulting from Dyadic's proper termination of our license rights for Dyadic's commercial scale expression systems for cellulases;•risks associated with the international aspects of our business; •our ability to integrate any businesses we may acquire with our business; •our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner; •our ability to obtain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights; •our ability to prevent the theft or misappropriation of our biocatalysts, the genes that code for our biocatalysts, know-how or technologies; •potential advantages that our competitors and potential competitors may have in securing funding or developing products; •business interruptions, such as earthquakes and other natural disasters; •public concerns about the ethical, legal and social ramifications of genetically engineered products and processes; •our ability to comply with laws and regulations; •our ability to properly handle and dispose of hazardous materials used in our business; •potential product liability claims; and•our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Due to the various factors mentioned above, and others, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance. We have a history of net losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability. We have incurred net losses since our inception, including losses of $16.6 million, $30.9 million and $41.3 million in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, we had an accumulated deficit of $256.9 million. Until September 2012, we derived a substantial portion of our revenues from research and development agreements with our collaborators, particularly Shell, who accounted for 0%, 51% and 51% of our revenues in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our research and development collaboration with Shell terminated effective as of August 31, 2012, and we do not expect to receive further collaboration revenue from Shell. In November 2013, we announced that we had immediately begun to wind down our CodeXyme® cellulase enzymes program, and that we had stopped further development of our CodeXol® detergent alcohols program in the third quarter of 2013. If we are unable to expand our biocatalysis business, through new or expanded 15Table of Contentscollaborations, development of new products or services, or increased sales of existing products and services, our net losses may increase and we may never achieve profitability. In addition, some of our collaboration agreements provide for milestone payments and/or future royalty payments, which we will only receive if we and our collaborators develop and commercialize products. We also may fund development of additional biocatalysis products. There can be no assurance that any of these products will become commercially viable or that we will ever achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we fail to achieve profitability, or if the time required to achieve profitability is longer than we anticipate, we may not be able to continue our business. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. We may need substantial additional capital in the future in order to expand our business. Our future capital requirements may be substantial, particularly as we continue to develop our business. Although we believe that, based on our current level of operations, our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations, planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, we may need additional capital if our current plans and assumptions change. Our need for additional capital will depend on many factors, including the financial success of our biocatalysis business, our spending to develop and commercialize new and existing products and the amount of collaboration funding we may receive to help cover the cost of such expenditures, the effect of any acquisitions of other businesses, technologies or facilities that we may make or develop in the future, our spending on new market opportunities, including opportunities in the fine chemicals markets, and the filing, prosecution, enforcement and defense of patent claims. If our capital resources are insufficient to meet our capital requirements, and we are unable to enter into or maintain collaborations with partners that are able or willing to fund our development efforts or commercialize any products that we develop or enable, we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technology and products and complete the commercialization of products, if any, resulting from our technologies. If future financings involve the issuance of equity securities, our existing stockholders would suffer dilution. If we raise debt financing, we may be subject to restrictive covenants that limit our ability to conduct our business. We may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. If we fail to raise sufficient funds and fail to generate sufficient revenues to achieve planned gross margins and to control operating costs, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of strategic opportunities, develop products or technologies, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. If this happens, we may be forced to delay or terminate research or development programs or the commercialization of products resulting from our technologies, curtail or cease operations or obtain funds through collaborative and licensing arrangements that may require us to relinquish commercial rights, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available, we will not be able to successfully execute our business plan or continue our business. We are dependent on a limited number of customers. Our current revenues are derived from a limited number of key customers. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our top five customers accounted for 83% of our total revenues, with Shell accounting for 51% of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our top five customers accounted for 81% of our total revenues. Our research collaboration with Shell terminated effective as of August 31, 2012, which means that we will not receive any additional collaboration funding from Shell. We expect a limited number of customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results. The loss or reduction of business from one or a combination of our significant customers could, materially adversely affect our revenues, financial condition and results of operations.If we are unable to develop and commercialize new products for the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals markets, our business and prospects will be harmed. We plan to launch new products for the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals markets. These efforts are subject to numerous risks, including the following: •pharmaceutical and fine chemicals companies may be reluctant to adopt new manufacturing processes that use our enzymes; •we may be unable to successfully develop the enzymes or manufacturing processes for our products in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all; •we may face difficulties in transferring the developed technologies to our customers and the contract manufacturers that we may use for commercial scale production of intermediates and enzymes in these markets; •the contract manufacturers that we may use may be unable to scale their manufacturing operations to meet the demand for these products and we may be unable to secure additional manufacturing capacity; •customers may not be willing to purchase these products for these markets from us on favorable terms, if at all; •we may face product liability litigation, unexpected safety or efficacy concerns and product recalls or withdrawals; 16Table of Contents•changes in laws or regulations relating to the pharmaceutical industry or the industries into which we sell our fine chemicals products, including the food industry, could cause us to incur increased costs of compliance or otherwise harm our business; •our customers' products may experience adverse events or face competition from new products, which would reduce demand for our products; •we may face pressure from existing or new competitive products; and •we may face pricing pressures from existing or new competitors, some of which may benefit from government subsidies or other incentives. If goodwill or our intangible or other long-lived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Our total assets reflect goodwill of $3.2 million, intangible assets of $9.6 million and other long-lived assets of $8.8 million as of December 31, 2013. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, we review goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis and at any interim date whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We review our long lived and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances (i.e., information that indicates an impairment might exist), could include: a significant decrease in the market price of the Company's common stock; current period cash flow losses or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the assets; slower growth rates in our industry; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the assets; loss of significant customers or partners; or the current expectation that the assets will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of their estimated useful life. For example, as described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2013, we determined that continued operating losses and a decline in market price of the Company’s common stock were indicators of impairment. Consequently, we tested long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment as of December 31, 2013. Based on our analysis, we determined that the fair value of the assets exceeded their carrying value and that no impairment was necessary as of December 31, 2013. Nevertheless, we may experience additional events or changes in circumstances in the future that we determine to be indicators of impairment, and that may in turn require us to undertake impairment analysis in future periods. Depending on the circumstances and judgments made at such future time, the outcome of the analysis may require us to recognize impairment.We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets is determined, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.We implemented cost saving measures in the fourth quarter of 2013, and we may implement additional cost saving measures in the future. These measures may interfere with the operation of our business and if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits of these measures, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. In November 2013, we announced a restructuring plan that includes a reduction of approximately 15 employees in the United States. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and financial benefits from this reduction and restructuring activity, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. Restructuring costs include exit-related costs arising from contractual and other obligations. We continue to review our cost structure and may implement further cost saving initiatives in the future. This cost reduction effort may interfere with our ability to achieve our business objectives, may be difficult to manage, may cause concerns from current and potential customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business and may increase the likelihood of turnover of other key employees, all of which may have an adverse impact on our business.Our revenues, financial condition and results of operations may also be adversely affected if one or more of our customers is delayed in paying, or becomes unable to pay, for our delivered products on a timely basis.Certain of our customers are, or in the future may become, subject to significant economic and other challenges that affect their cash flow, and many customers outside of the United States are generally accustomed to vendor financing in the form of extended payment terms which may exceed contractual payment terms. To remain competitive in markets outside of the United States, we may offer selected customers payment flexibility. We consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable, and accordingly, we defer revenue until payment is received. The costs associated with such revenue deferral are also deferred and classified as other current assets in the financial statements. If these customers fail to pay us on a timely basis it may cause our financial results to fluctuate and we may decide to grant concessions to such 17Table of Contentscustomers to increase the probability of payment. Such concessions, or failure by such customers to pay at all, would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent on a limited number of products in our pharmaceutical business. Our current product revenues are derived from a limited number of pharmaceutical products. We expect a limited number of pharmaceutical products to continue to account for a significant portion of our pharmaceutical product revenues for the foreseeable future. This product concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results. The loss or reduction of business of one or a combination of our significant pharmaceutical products could materially adversely affect our revenues, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $20.4 million, a decrease from $35.9 million in product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012, and $49.0 million in product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to lower revenues for generic statin-family products. These products were approximately $2.7 million in product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to $20.9 million and $30.0 million, for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires companies to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting. At the end of each fiscal year, we must perform an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting, include in our annual report the results of the evaluation, and have our external auditors publicly attest to such evaluation.In connection with the integrated audit of our consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting and management's assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting at December 31, 2012, a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting was identified. The material weakness we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified related to the lack of a sufficient number of qualified personnel to timely and appropriately account for complex, non-routine transactions in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. We implemented policies and procedures to remediate this deficiency and based on the procedures performed as of December 31, 2013, we noted no control deficiencies that would arise to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. We have taken numerous steps to enhance our internal control over financial reporting, including the development and implementation of policies, improved processes and documented procedures, the retention of third-party experts and contractors, and the hiring of additional accounting and finance personnel with technical accounting, inventory accounting and financial reporting experience. We cannot assure you that in the future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered, a risk that is significantly increased in light of the complexity of our business and multinational operations. If other deficiencies are discovered in the future, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be impaired, which could result in late filings of our annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, restatements of our consolidated financial statements, a decline in our stock price, suspension or delisting of our common stock by The NASDAQ Global Market, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We are dependent on contract manufacturers for commercial scale production of substantially all of our enzymes. We have limited internal capacity to manufacture enzymes. As a result, we are dependent upon the performance and capacity of third party manufacturers for the commercial scale manufacturing of the enzymes used in our pharmaceutical and fine chemicals business. We rely on one contract manufacturer, Lactosan, for our pharmaceutical business to manufacture substantially all of the commercial enzymes used in our pharmaceutical and fine chemicals businesses. These businesses, therefore, face risks of difficulties with, and interruptions in, performance by Lactosan, the occurrence of which could adversely impact the availability, launch and/or sales of our enzymes in the future. We have qualified other contract manufacturers to manufacture enzymes for our pharmaceutical business, but currently have limited reliance on them for our supply requirements. The failure of any contract manufacturers that we may use to supply manufactured enzymes on a timely basis or at all, or to manufacture our enzymes in compliance with our specifications or applicable quality requirements or in volumes sufficient to meet demand would adversely affect our ability to sell pharmaceutical and fine and complex chemicals products, could harm our relationships with our collaborators or customers and could negatively affect our revenues and operating results. We may be forced to secure alternative sources of supply, which may be unavailable on commercially acceptable terms, cause delays in our ability to deliver products to our customers, increase our costs and decrease our profit margins. 18Table of ContentsWe do not have any supply agreements in place with any enzyme contract manufacturers, other than Lactosan. In the absence of a supply agreement, a contract manufacturer will be under no obligation to manufacture our enzymes and could elect to discontinue their manufacture at any time. If we require additional manufacturing capacity and are unable to obtain it in sufficient quantity, we may not be able to increase our pharmaceutical and fine and complex chemicals sales, or we may be required to make substantial capital investments to build that capacity or to contract with other manufacturers on terms that may be less favorable than the terms we currently have with our suppliers. If we choose to build our own additional manufacturing facility, it could take two years or longer before our facility is able to produce commercial volumes of our enzymes. Any resources we expend on acquiring or building internal manufacturing capabilities could be at the expense of other potentially more profitable opportunities. In addition, if we contract with other manufacturers, we may experience delays of several months in qualifying them, which could harm our relationships with our collaborators or customers and could negatively affect our revenues or operating results. We are dependent on our collaborators, and our failure to successfully manage these relationships could prevent us from developing and commercializing many of our products and achieving or sustaining profitability, and could lead to disagreements with our current or former collaborators. Our ability to maintain and manage collaborations in our markets is fundamental to the success of our business. We currently have license agreements, research and development agreements, supply agreements and/or distribution agreements with various collaborators. We may have limited or no control over the amount or timing of resources that any collaborator is able or willing to devote to our partnered products or collaborative efforts. Any of our collaborators may fail to perform its obligations. These collaborators may breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner. Further, our collaborators may not develop products arising out of our collaborative arrangements or devote sufficient resources to the development, manufacture, marketing, or sale of these products. Moreover, disagreements with a collaborator could develop and any conflict with a collaborator lead to litigation and could reduce our ability to enter into future collaboration agreements and negatively impact our relationships with one or more existing collaborators. If any of these events occur, or if we fail to maintain our agreements with our collaborators, we may not be able to commercialize our existing and potential products, grow our business, or generate sufficient revenues to support our operations, and we may be involved in litigation. Our collaboration opportunities could be harmed if: •we do not achieve our research and development objectives under our collaboration agreements in a timely manner or at all; •we develop products and processes or enter into additional collaborations that conflict with the business objectives of our other collaborators; •our collaborators and/or our contract manufacturers do not receive the required regulatory and other approvals necessary for the commercialization of the applicable product;•we disagree with our collaborators as to rights to intellectual property that are developed during the collaboration, or their research programs or commercialization activities; •we are unable to manage multiple simultaneous collaborations; •our collaborators become competitors of ours or enter into agreements with our competitors; •our collaborators become unable or less willing to expend their resources on research and development or commercialization efforts due to general market conditions, their financial condition or other circumstances beyond our control; or •our collaborators experience business difficulties, which could eliminate or impair their ability to effectively perform under our agreements. Additionally, despite the termination of the research term of our three-way research collaboration with Shell and Iogen, many elements of our collaborative research and license agreement with Shell and Iogen will continue. For example, the collaborative research and license agreement provides for certain rights, licenses and obligations of each party with respect to intellectual property and program materials that will continue after the research activities have ended. Disagreements or conflicts between and among the parties could develop even though the research program has ended. These disagreements or conflicts could result in expensive arbitration or litigation, which may not be resolved in our favor. Finally, our business could be negatively affected if any of our collaborators or suppliers undergo a change of control or were to otherwise assign the rights or obligations under any of our agreements. Our efforts to deploy our technology platform in the fine chemicals markets, may fail.We have recently begun to use our CodeEvolver® directed evolution technology platform to develop new products in the fine chemicals markets. We do not know if we can successfully compete in this new market. This new market is well established and consists of numerous large, well-funded entrenched market participants who have long and established track records and customer relationships. We have currently developed products in the food and solvent sectors of this market, and these 19Table of Contentsproducts, or any other products that we may develop in the future for the fine chemicals market, we may not succeed in displacing current products. If we succeed in commercializing new products for the fine chemicals market, we may not generate significant revenue and cash flows from these activities. The failure to successfully deploy products in the fine chemicals space may limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and business prospects. If we lose key personnel, including key management personnel, or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel as needed in the future, it could disrupt the operation of our business, delay our product development programs, harm our research and development efforts, and we may be unable to pursue collaborations or develop our own products. Our business involves complex, global operations across a variety of markets and requires a management team and employee workforce that is knowledgeable in the many areas in which we operate. The loss of any key members of our management team or the failure to attract or retain other key employees who possess the requisite expertise for the conduct of our business could prevent us from developing and commercializing our products for our target markets and entering into collaborations or licensing arrangements to execute on our business strategy. In addition, the loss of any key scientific staff, or the failure to attract or retain other key scientific employees, could prevent us from developing and commercializing our products for our target markets and entering into collaborations or licensing arrangements to execute on our business strategy. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology and other technology-based businesses or due to the availability of personnel with the qualifications or experience necessary for our business. Additionally, potential future government awards may require us to maintain a minimum level of staffing. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience staffing constraints that will adversely affect our ability to meet the demands of our collaborators and customers in a timely fashion or to support our internal research and development programs. In particular, our product and process development programs are dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists and engineers. Competition for experienced scientists and other technical personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms. All of our employees are at-will employees, which mean that either the employee or we may terminate their employment at any time. Our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products and processes developed through our technology platform or acquired through strategic or other transactions, especially in the end markets that we seek to penetrate. These activities will require the addition of new personnel, and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel. The inability to attract personnel with appropriate skills or to develop the necessary expertise could impair our ability to grow our business. In August and September 2012, we implemented a corporate restructuring plan that included a reduction in work force of approximately 55% of our total workforce and the closure of our Singapore facility. We also announced a workforce reduction on November 12, 2013, which includes the termination of approximately 12% of our total workforce. Our restructuring activities and the workforce reductions have had and may continue to have a negative effect on employee morale, and we may have difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Our business could be adversely affected if our customers' products are not received well in the market, if their products, or the processes used by our customers to manufacture their final products, fail to be approved, or if our customers discontinue their drug development activities for any reason. Our enzymes are used by our pharmaceutical customers in the manufacture of intermediates and APIs which are then used in the manufacture of final pharmaceutical products by our existing and potential branded drug customers, and by our fine chemicals customers to manufacture food ingredients. Our business could be adversely affected if these final products do not perform in the market as well as expected, or if our customers encounter competition from new entrants into the market with competing, and possibly superior, products. Additionally, these pharmaceutical and food products must be approved by the FDA in the United States and similar regulatory bodies in other markets prior to commercialization. If our customers who sell branded-drugs, which we refer to as innovators, fail to receive regulatory approval for the drugs, fail to receive regulatory approval for new manufacturing processes for previously approved drugs, or decide for business or other reasons to discontinue their drug development activities, our revenues and prospects will be negatively impacted. The process of producing these drugs, and their generic equivalents, is also subject to regulation by the FDA in the United States and equivalent regulatory bodies in other markets. Similarly, if the market-leading food ingredients company that we have recently begun performing services for is unable to receive regulatory approval for its product, or decides to discontinue developing its product using our technology, our revenues and prospects will be negatively impacted. If any pharmaceutical or food manufacturing process that uses our enzymes or enzyme technology does not receive approval by the appropriate regulatory body or if customers decide not to pursue approval, our business could be adversely affected. 20Table of ContentsOur pharmaceutical product gross margins are variable and may decline from quarter to quarter. Our pharmaceutical product gross margins have varied significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future due to a variety of factors, including product mix, pricing pressure from our pharmaceutical customers and competition from other products or technologies. This variability may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition and cause our stock price to decline. We may be exposed to third party legal claims if Dyadic terminates our license rights to Dyadic’s commercial scale expression system for the production of enzymes.We entered into the Dyadic license agreement in November 2008 to obtain a non-exclusive license to Dyadic's C-1 based proprietary fungal expression technology for the production of enzymes. We are licensed to use these enzymes to make products in the fields of biofuels, certain pharmaceuticals, chemicals, air treatment, water treatment and the conversion of cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars for use in non-fuel products. We also obtained access to specified materials of Dyadic relating to such Dyadic technology. We used the licensed technology in connection with our CodeXyme® cellulase enzyme program which we announced on November 12, 2013 we were immediately beginning to wind down. Our license is sublicenseable to Shell and to affiliates of Shell in the field of biofuels, and sublicenseable to third parties in the non-biofuels fields of certain pharmaceuticals, chemicals, air treatment, water treatment and the conversion of cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars for non-fuel products. Dyadic has the right to terminate our licenses under the license agreement if we challenge the validity of any of the patents licensed under the Dyadic license agreement and for various other reasons, including by reason of an uncured material breach by Codexis. Our licenses and access to such materials of Dyadic under the Dyadic license agreement will terminate as a result of any proper termination of the Dyadic license agreement other than due to Dyadic's material breach. Our sublicense to Shell under the Dyadic license agreement will also terminate if the Dyadic license agreement is properly terminated other than due to Dyadic's material breach. Any termination of our licenses under the Dyadic license agreement may result in potential litigation with third parties that we have sublicensed these license rights to. Any such termination could also adversely affect our ability to enter into a strategic transaction involving our CodeXyme® cellulase enzymes program.On July 30, 2013, Dyadic delivered notice to us alleging that we were in breach under the Dyadic license agreement and stating that Dyadic intended to terminate the Dyadic license agreement in 60 days if the alleged breach was not cured to Dyadic's satisfaction. This notice was subsequently withdrawn by Dyadic in March 2014 in light of our decision to wind down our CodeXyme® cellulase enzyme program. In connection with the withdrawal, we agreed with Dyadic that such withdrawal does not constitute (1) a waiver or impairment of Dyadic’s ability to assert any rights, remedies or claims that Dyadic has or will have in the future against us under the Dyadic License Agreement; (2) a waiver of any defenses to any claims we may assert now or in the future; (3) a concession that any claim, remedy or defense Dyadic may have lacks merit; or (4) an acknowledgment that we have cured any aspect of the alleged breach. Although we do not believe that the use of the licensed technology in our CodeXyme® cellulase enzyme program constituted a breach of the Dyadic license agreement , we can make no assurances that Dyadic will not make such allegations again in the future, or regarding our ability to resolve any possible future disputes with Dyadic on commercially reasonable terms or our ability to dispute with success, through legal action or otherwise, any possible future allegations by Dyadic that such use may have breached the Dyadic license agreement. We may be unable to realize a favorable strategic transaction for our former CodeXyme® cellulase enzymes and CodeXol® detergent alcohols programs.In November 2013 we announced that we were winding down our CodeXyme® cellulase enzymes program, and that we had stopped development of our CodeXol® detergent alcohols program. Although we continue to explore possible strategic transactions with respect to those programs and their related assets, we may be unable to effect any such strategic transactions on favorable terms, if it all, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We face risks associated with our international business. Significant portions of our operations are conducted outside of the United States and we expect to continue to have significant foreign operations in the foreseeable future. International business operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: •changes in or interpretations of foreign regulations that may adversely affect our ability to sell our products, repatriate profits to the United States or operate our foreign-located facilities; •the imposition of tariffs; •the imposition of limitations on, or increase of, withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures; 21Table of Contents•the imposition of limitations on genetically-engineered products or processes and the production or sale of those products or processes in foreign countries; •currency exchange rate fluctuations; •uncertainties relating to foreign laws, regulations and legal proceedings including tax, import/export, anti-corruption and exchange control laws; •the availability of government subsidies or other incentives that benefit competitors in their local markets that are not available to us; •increased demands on our limited resources created by our diversified, global operations may constrain the capabilities of our administrative and operational resources and restrict our ability to attract, train, manage and retain qualified management, technicians, scientists and other personnel; •economic or political instability in foreign countries; •difficulties associated with staffing and managing foreign operations; and •the need to comply with a variety of United States and foreign laws applicable to the conduct of international business, including import and export control laws and anti-corruption laws. If we engage in any acquisitions, we will incur a variety of costs and may potentially face numerous risks that could adversely affect our business and operations. We have made acquisitions in the past, and if appropriate opportunities become available, we expect to acquire additional businesses, assets, technologies, or products to enhance our business in the future. For example, in October 2010, we acquired substantially all of the patents and other intellectual property rights associated with Maxygen's directed evolution technology. In connection with any future acquisitions, we could: •issue additional equity securities, which would dilute our current stockholders; •incur substantial debt to fund the acquisitions; •use our cash to fund the acquisitions; or •assume significant liabilities including litigation risk. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including problems integrating the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs and other liabilities, diversion of management's attention from our core businesses, adverse effects on existing business relationships with current and/or prospective collaborators, customers and/or suppliers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees. We do not have extensive experience in managing the integration process and we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses, assets, products, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire in the future without a significant expenditure of operating, financial and management resources, if at all. The integration process could divert management's time from focusing on operating our business, result in a decline in employee morale and cause retention issues to arise from changes in compensation, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the business. Acquisitions may also require us to record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur large and immediate write offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may acquire companies that have insufficient internal financial controls, which could impair our ability to integrate the acquired company and adversely impact our financial reporting. If we fail in our integration efforts with respect to any of our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. We must rely on our suppliers, contract manufacturers and customers to deliver timely and accurate information in order to accurately report our financial results in the time frame and manner required by law. We need to receive timely, accurate and complete information from a number of third parties in order to accurately report our financial results on a timely basis. We rely on suppliers and certain contract manufacturers to provide us with timely and accurate information regarding our inventories and manufacturing cost information, and we rely on current and former collaborators to provide us with product sales and cost saving information in connection with royalties owed to us. Any failure to receive timely information from one or more of these third parties could require that we estimate a greater portion of our revenues and other operating performance metrics for the period, which could cause our reported financial results to be incorrect. Moreover, if the information that we receive is not accurate, our financial statements may be materially incorrect and may require restatement, and we may not receive the full amount of revenues that we are entitled to under these arrangements. Although we typically have audit rights with these parties, performing such an audit could be harmful to our collaborative relationships, expensive and time consuming and may not be sufficient to reveal any discrepancies in a timeframe consistent with our reporting requirements. 22Table of ContentsOur ability to compete may decline if we do not adequately protect our proprietary technologies or if we lose some of our intellectual property rights. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property for our technologies and products and potential products in the United States and other countries. We have adopted a strategy of seeking patent protection in the United States and in foreign countries with respect to certain of the technologies used in or relating to our products and processes. As such, as of December 31, 2013, we owned or controlled approximately 394 issued patents and approximately 301 pending patent applications in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Some of our gene shuffling patents will expire as early as 2014. We also have license rights to a number of issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications are directed to our enabling technologies and to the methods and products that support our business in the pharmaceuticals manufacturing and complex chemistry markets. We intend to continue to apply for patents relating to our technologies, methods and products as we deem appropriate. Numerous patents in our portfolio involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, enforceability cannot be predicted with any certainty. Issued patents and patents issuing from pending applications may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Moreover, the United States Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, enacted in September 2011, brings significant changes to the United States patent system, which include a change to a “first to file” system from a “first to invent” system and changes to the procedures for challenging issued patents and disputing patent applications during the examination process, among other things. The effects of these changes on our patent portfolio and business are currently uncertain as the United Stated Patent and Trademark Office has just implemented regulations related to these changes and the courts have yet to address many of these provisions in the context of a dispute. We have not assessed the applicability of the act and new regulations on our patent portfolio. These changes could increase the costs and uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our patent rights. Additional uncertainty may result from legal precedent handed down by the United States Federal Circuit Court and Supreme Court as they determine legal issues concerning the scope and construction of patent claims and inconsistent interpretation of patent laws by the lower courts. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents, or even if issued, predict the breadth of the claims upheld in our and other companies' patents. Given that the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, we cannot ensure that: (i) we were the first to invent the inventions covered by each of our pending applications, (ii) we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions, or (iii) the proprietary technologies we develop will be patentable. In addition, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in certain foreign countries where the local laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Moreover, third parties could practice our inventions in territories where we do not have patent protection. Such third parties may then try to import products made using our inventions into the United States or other territories. If competitors are able to use our technology, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed. Moreover, others may independently develop and obtain patents for technologies that are similar to or superior to our technologies. If that happens, we may need to license these technologies, and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, if at all, which could cause harm to our business. Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, which may subject us to costly and time consuming litigation and prevent us from developing or commercializing our products. Our commercial success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties, and without breaching any licenses or other agreements that we have entered into with regard to our technologies, products and business. We cannot ensure that patents have not been issued to third parties that could block our ability to obtain patents or to operate as we would like. There may be patents in some countries that, if valid, may block our ability to make, use or sell our products in those countries, or import our products into those countries, if we are unsuccessful in circumventing or acquiring the rights to these patents. There also may be claims in patent applications filed in some countries that, if granted and valid, may also block our ability to commercialize products or processes in these countries if we are unable to circumvent or license them. 23Table of ContentsThe industries in which we operate and the biotechnology industry in particular, are characterized by frequent and extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Many biotechnology companies have employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage. Our involvement in litigation, interferences, opposition proceedings or other intellectual property proceedings inside and outside of the United States, to defend our intellectual property rights or as a result of alleged infringement of the rights of others, may divert our management's time from focusing on business operations and could cause us to spend significant amounts of money. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following: • stop selling or using our products or technologies that use the subject intellectual property; •pay monetary damages or substantial royalties; •grant cross-licenses to third parties relating to our patents or proprietary rights; •obtain from the third party asserting its intellectual property rights a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or •redesign those products or processes that use any allegedly infringing technology, or relocate the operations relating to the allegedly infringing technology to another jurisdiction, which may result in significant cost or delay to us, could be technically infeasible or could prevent us from selling some of our products in the United States or other jurisdictions. We are aware of a significant number of patents and patent applications relating to aspects of our technologies filed by, and issued to, third parties. We cannot assure you that if this third party intellectual property is asserted against us that we would ultimately prevail. If any of our competitors have filed patent applications or obtained patents that claim inventions also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention and, thus, the right to the patents for these inventions in the United States. These proceedings could result in substantial cost to us even if the outcome is favorable. Even if successful, any interference may result in loss of certain claims. Any litigation or proceedings could divert our management's time and efforts. Even unsuccessful claims could result in significant legal fees and other expenses, diversion of management time, and disruption in our business. Uncertainties resulting from initiation and continuation of any patent or related litigation could harm our ability to compete. We may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world. The laws of some foreign countries where we do business do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property, particularly those relating to biotechnology and/or bioindustrial technologies. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. Additionally, proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. If our biocatalysts, or the genes that code for our biocatalysts, are stolen, misappropriated or reverse engineered, others could use these biocatalysts or genes to produce competing products. Third parties, including our contract manufacturers, customers and those involved in shipping our biocatalysts, often have custody or control of our biocatalysts. If our biocatalysts, or the genes that code for our biocatalysts, were stolen, misappropriated or reverse engineered, they could be used by other parties who may be able to reproduce these biocatalysts for their own commercial gain. If this were to occur, it would be difficult for us to challenge this type of use, especially in countries with limited intellectual property protection or in countries in which we do not have patents covering the misappropriated biocatalysts. Confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosures of trade secrets and other proprietary information. We rely in part on trade secret protection to protect our confidential and proprietary information and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, but these measures may not be effective. We require employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting arrangement with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual's relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property. Nevertheless, 24Table of Contentsour proprietary information may be disclosed, third parties could reverse engineer our biocatalysts and others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. Competitors and potential competitors who have greater resources and experience than we do may develop products and technologies that make ours obsolete or may use their greater resources to gain market share at our expense. The biocatalysis industry and each of our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change. Our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances. In addition, as we enter new markets, we will face new competition and will need to adapt to competitive factors that may be different from what we face today. We are aware that other companies, including Royal DSM N.V., or DSM and Novozymes, have alternative methods for obtaining and generating genetic diversity or use mutagenesis techniques to produce genetic diversity. Academic institutions such as the California Institute of Technology, the Max Planck Institute and the Center for Fundamental and Applied Molecular Evolution (FAME), a jointly sponsored initiative between Emory University and Georgia Institute of Technology, are also working in this field. Technological development by others may result in our products and technologies, as well as products developed by our customers using our biocatalysts, becoming obsolete. Our primary competitors in the biocatalysis market for pharmaceutical products are companies using conventional, non-enzymatic processes to manufacture pharmaceutical intermediates and APIs that compete in the marketplace with our enzymatically manufactured products. The principal methods of competition and competitive differentiation in this market are product quality and performance, including manufacturing yield and safety and environmental benefits, speed of delivery of product and price. The market for the manufacture and supply of APIs and intermediates is large with many established companies. These companies include many of our large innovator and generic pharmaceutical customers, such as Merck, Pfizer, Bristol Myers Squibb and Teva, who have significant internal research and development efforts directed at developing processes to manufacture APIs and intermediates. The processes used by these companies include classical conventional organic chemistry reactions, chemo catalysis reactions catalyzed by chemical catalysts, or biocatalytic routes using commercially available enzymes, or combinations thereof. Our manufacturing processes must compete with these internally developed routes. Additionally, we also face competition from companies such as Solvias Inc. and Takasago International Corporation who use metal-based chemical reactions for their pharmaceutical products, rather than a biocatalytic process. Finally, we face increasing competition from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in low cost centers such as India and China. The market for supplying enzymes for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing is quite fragmented. There is competition from large industrial enzyme companies, such as Novozymes, as well as subsidiaries of larger pharmaceutical companies, such as DSM, Cambrex Corporation and Almac Group Ltd. There is also competition in the customized and optimized enzyme area from several small European companies, such as BRAIN AG, C-LEcta GmbH and Evocatal GmbH.We entered the fine chemicals market in 2013, namely applying our biocatalysis technology in the food and solvents markets. We face similar forms of competition in this market as in the pharmaceutical markets, with the exceptions that our fine chemicals customers do not have the in-house biocatalysis capabilities that our pharmaceutical customers have and the risk of losing out on opportunities to larger competitors in fine chemicals is greater given the larger scale of opportunities available in the fine chemicals markets compared to the pharmaceutical market. Our significant competitors in the fine chemical markets include companies that have been in these marketplaces for many years, such as Dupont-Genencor, DSM, Novozymes and A.B. Enterprises. These companies have greater resources in these markets than we do and have long-term supply arrangements already in place with customers. Our ability to compete in these markets may be limited by our relatively late start.Our ability to compete successfully in any of these markets will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner and are technologically superior to and/or are less expensive than other products on the market. Many of our competitors have substantially greater production, financial, research and development, personnel and marketing resources than we do. They also started developing products earlier than we did, which may allow them to establish blocking intellectual property positions or bring products to market before we can. In addition, certain of our competitors may also benefit from local government subsidies and other incentives that are not available to us. As a result, our competitors may be able to develop competing and/or superior technologies and processes, and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. We cannot be certain that any products we develop in the future will compare favorably to products offered by our competitors or that our existing or future products will compare favorably to any new products that are developed by our competitors. As more 25Table of Contentscompanies develop new intellectual property in our markets, the possibility of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit our products or potential products increases, which could lead to litigation. Our limited resources relative to many of our competitors may cause us to fail to anticipate or respond adequately to new developments and other competitive pressures. This failure could reduce our competitiveness and market share, adversely affect our results of operations and financial position, and prevent us from obtaining or maintaining profitability. Business interruptions could delay us in the process of developing our products and could disrupt our sales. Our headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to other types of natural disasters and other events that could disrupt our operations, such as riot, civil disturbances, war, terrorist acts, flood, infections in our laboratory or production facilities or those of our contract manufacturers and other events beyond our control. We do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan. In addition, we do not carry insurance for earthquakes and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and success as an overall business. Ethical, legal and social concerns about genetically engineered products and processes could limit or prevent the use of our products, processes, and technologies and limit our revenues. Some of our products and processes are genetically engineered or involve the use of genetically engineered products or genetic engineering technologies. If we and/or our collaborators are not able to overcome the ethical, legal, and social concerns relating to genetic engineering, our products and processes may not be accepted. Any of the risks discussed below could result in increased expenses, delays, or other impediments to our programs or the public acceptance and commercialization of products and processes dependent on our technologies or inventions. Our ability to develop and commercialize one or more of our technologies, products, or processes could be limited by the following factors: •public attitudes about the safety and environmental hazards of, and ethical concerns over, genetic research and genetically engineered products and processes, which could influence public acceptance of our technologies, products and processes; •public attitudes regarding, and potential changes to laws governing ownership of genetic material, which could harm our intellectual property rights with respect to our genetic material and discourage collaborators from supporting, developing, or commercializing our products, processes and technologies; and •governmental reaction to negative publicity concerning genetically modified organisms, which could result in greater government regulation of genetic research and derivative products. The subject of genetically modified organisms has received negative publicity, which has aroused public debate. This adverse publicity could lead to greater regulation and trade restrictions on imports of genetically altered products. The biocatalysts that we develop have significantly enhanced characteristics compared to those found in naturally occurring enzymes or microbes. While we produce our biocatalysts only for use in a controlled industrial environment, the release of such biocatalysts into uncontrolled environments could have unintended consequences. Any adverse effect resulting from such a release could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, and we may have exposure to liability for any resulting harm. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our food products, if required, and, even if approvals are obtained, complying on an ongoing basis with the numerous regulatory requirements applicable to these products will be time-consuming and costly. The product that we are currently developing for the food market is, and any other products that we may develop for this market will likely be, subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the FDA, state and local agencies and similar agencies outside the United States, as well as religious compliance certifying organizations. Food ingredients are regulated either as food additives or as substances generally recognized as safe, or GRAS. A substance can be listed or affirmed as GRAS by the FDA or self-affirmed by its manufacturer upon determination that independent qualified experts would generally agree that the substance is GRAS for a particular use. While we expect to self-affirm the product that we are currently developing for the food market, our customer will need to submit a GRAS Notice of Determination for the final commercial product. There can be no assurance that our customer will not receive any objections from the FDA to its Notice of Determination. If the FDA were to disagree with our customer’s determination, they could ask our customer to voluntarily withdraw the final commercial product from the market or could initiate legal action to halt its sale. Such actions by the FDA could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of our operations. Food ingredients that are not GRAS are regulated as food additives and require FDA approval prior to commercialization. The food additive petition process is generally expensive and time consuming, with approval, if secured, taking years. 26Table of ContentsChanges in regulatory requirements, laws and policies, or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, laws and policies, may result in increased compliance costs, delays, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. We expect to encounter regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to sell our food products, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary approvals in a timely manner or at all. If our existing and future food products do not meet applicable regulatory requirements in a particular country or at all, then we may not be able to commercialize them and our business will be adversely affected. The various regulatory schemes applicable to our food products will continue to apply following initial approval for sale. Monitoring regulatory changes and ensuring our ongoing compliance with applicable requirements will be time-consuming and may affect our results of operations. If we fail to comply with such requirements on an ongoing basis, we may be subject to fines or other penalties, or may be prevented from selling our food products and our business may be harmed. We use hazardous materials in our business and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials or noncompliance of applicable laws and regulations could be time consuming and costly and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our research and development and commercial processes involve the use of hazardous materials, including chemical, radioactive, and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste. We cannot eliminate entirely the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of, and human exposure to, these materials. We may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Although we believe that our activities comply in all material respects with environmental laws, there can be no assurance that violations of environmental, health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and the failure to comply with past, present, or future laws could result in the imposition of fines, third party property damage, product liability and personal injury claims, investigation and remediation costs, the suspension of production, or a cessation of operations, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault. Environmental laws could become more stringent over time imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could impair our research, development or production efforts and harm our business. In addition, we may have to indemnify some of our customers or suppliers for losses related to our failure to comply with environmental laws, which could expose us to significant liabilities. We may be sued for product liability. The design, development, manufacture and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity. For example, we may be named directly in product liability suits relating to drugs that are produced using our enzymes or that incorporate our intermediates and APIs. The biocatalysts, pharmaceutical intermediates and APIs that we produce or are produced for us by our manufacturing partners could be subject to quality control or contamination issues of which we are not aware. Claims could be brought by various parties, including customers who are purchasing products directly from us, other companies who purchase products from our customers or by the end users of the drugs. We could also be named as co-parties in product liability suits that are brought against our contract manufacturers who manufacture our enzymes, pharmaceutical intermediates and APIs, such as Lactosan. Insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain, and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. We cannot assure you that any contract manufacturer that we have used in the past or shall use in the future has or will have adequate insurance coverage to cover against potential claims. In addition, although we currently maintain product liability insurance for our products in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable, if the coverage limits of these insurance policies are not adequate, a claim brought against us, whether covered by insurance or not, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. This insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential losses, and if claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage, we may go out of business. Moreover, we have agreed to indemnify some of our customers for certain claims that may arise out of the use of our products, which could expose us to significant liabilities. Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. If the Internal Revenue Service challenges our analysis that our existing NOLs are not subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, our ability to utilize NOLs could be limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the 27Table of ContentsInternal Revenue Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected in our financial statements, even if we attain profitability. Risks Related to Owning our Common Stock We are subject to anti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for a board of directors which is divided into three classes, with staggered three-year terms and provide that all stockholder action must be effected at a duly called meeting of the stockholders and not by a consent in writing, and further provide that only our board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, our chief executive officer or president may call a special meeting of the stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors, without further action by our stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. These provisions may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management team. Furthermore, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits, with some exceptions, stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Finally, our charter documents establish advanced notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. Although we believe these provisions together provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer to acquire our company may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. Concentration of ownership among our existing officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and depress our stock price. Based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2013, our officers, directors and stockholders who hold at least 5% of our stock together beneficially own approximately 37% of our outstanding common stock. If these officers, directors, and principal stockholders or a group of our principal stockholders act together, they will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and control matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. For instance, officers, directors, and principal stockholders, acting together, could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider. Similarly, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company otherwise favored by our other stockholders. As of December 31, 2013, Raízen, Biomedical Sciences Investment Fund Pte Ltd. and CMEA Ventures beneficially owned approximately 15%, 8% and 8% of our common stock, respectively. Our share price may be volatile which may cause the value of our common stock to decline and subject us to securities class action litigation. The market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including: •actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results; •the position of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; •actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors; •actual or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors' operating results or changes in their growth rate; •announcements of technological innovations by us, our collaborators or our competitors; •announcements by us, our collaborators or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; •additions or losses of one or more significant pharmaceutical products; •announcements or developments regarding pharmaceutical products manufactured using our biocatalysts, intermediates and APIs; •the entry into, modification or termination of collaborative arrangements; •additions or losses of customers; •additions or departures of key management or scientific personnel; •competition from existing products or new products that may emerge; •issuance of new or updated research reports by securities or industry analysts; 28Table of Contents•fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; •disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patent litigation and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies; •contractual disputes or litigation with our partners, customers or suppliers; •announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts; •sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders; •share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares; •general market conditions in our industry; and •general economic and market conditions, including the recent financial crisis. Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock in a negative manner, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. We incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as related rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Stock Market, impose various requirements on public companies that require our management and other personnel to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. Moreover, if we are not able to maintain compliance with the requirements of Section 404, our stock price could decline, and we could face sanctions, delisting or investigations by The NASDAQ Global Market, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
