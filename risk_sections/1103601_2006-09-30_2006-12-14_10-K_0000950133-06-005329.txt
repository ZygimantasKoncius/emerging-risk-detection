Item 1A. Risk Factors (concluded) paper and unsecured short-term bank loans by WGL Holdings. The results of operations of WGEServices would be adversely affected if short-term interest rates rose or if we were unable to access capital in a cost-effective manner. WGEServices is dependent on guarantees from WGL Holdings. The ability of WGEServices to purchase natural gas and electricity from suppliers is dependent upon guarantees issued on its behalf by WGL Holdings. Should WGL Holdings not renew such guarantees after the effective date of their cancellation, the ability of WGEServices to make commodity purchases at reasonable prices would be impaired, adversely affecting its results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Competition may negatively affect WGEServices. WGEServices competes with other non-regulated retail suppliers of natural gas and electricity, as well as with the commodity rate offerings of electric and gas utilities. Increases in competition including utility commodity rate offers that are below prevailing market rates may cause a loss of sales volumes or a reduction of growth opportunities for WGEServices that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows. Regulatory developments may negatively affect WGEServices. The regulations that govern the conduct of competitive energy markets are subject to change as the result of legislation or regulatory proceedings. Changes in these regulatory rules could reduce customer growth opportunities for WGEServices, or could reduce the profit opportunities associated with certain groups of existing or potential new customers and, thereby, adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.
