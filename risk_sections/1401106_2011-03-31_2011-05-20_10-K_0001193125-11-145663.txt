ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS developing, introducing or marketing new services, products and technologies. Any new service, product or technology we develop may not be accepted by the market. Any failure on our part to anticipate or respond adequately to technological advancements, client requirements or changing industry standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We must also devote resources to the regular maintenance of our systems, which, together with any necessary upgrades or expansions, could require significant expenditures of funds. We depend on outside vendors to provide some of the principal computerized systems we use to execute and clear client trades. Our ability to modify these outside systems is limited. As a result, as our markets expand and our clientsÂ’ trading and investment needs evolve, we may need to develop further our own proprietary systems to supplement or even replace some existing systems. That process would require a very significant capital investment and could involve difficult transition periods when service may be interrupted or may fail. If and when we decide, or are required, to upgrade or expand our systems (including our own proprietary systems), we may not have the funds necessary and the changes we make or undertake to make may not be successful or accepted by our clients. Our failure to maintain our systems as necessary or to upgrade and expand them in response to evolving client demands or emerging industry standards would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS There are no material unresolved written comments that were received from the SEC staff 180 days or more before the end of our fiscal year relating to our periodic or current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
