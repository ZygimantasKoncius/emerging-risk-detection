D. Risk FactorsThe Company's assets are primarily engaged in offshore contract drilling for the oil and gas industry in benign and harsh environments worldwide, including ultra-deepwater environments. The following summarizes risks that may materially affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash available for distributions or the trading price of the Company's common units. Risks Inherent in the Company's BusinessBecause the Company's ownership interest in OPCO currently represents the Company's only cash-generating asset, the Company's cash flow depends completely on OPCO’s ability to make distributions to its owners, including the Company.The Company's cash flow depends completely on OPCO’s distributions to the Company as one of its owners. The amount of cash OPCO can distribute to its owners principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the dayrates it obtains under its drilling contracts;•the level of its rig operating costs, such as the cost of crews, repair, maintenance and insurance;•the levels of reimbursable revenues and expenses;•its ability to re-contract its drilling units upon expiration or termination of an existing drilling contract and the dayrates it can obtain under such contracts;•delays in the delivery of any new drilling units and the beginning of payments under drilling contracts relating to those drilling units;•the timeliness of payments from customers under drilling contracts;•earn-out payment obligations related to purchases of drilling units;•prevailing global and regional economic and political conditions;•time spent mobilizing drilling units to the customer location;•changes in local income tax rates;•currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls; and•the effect of governmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization standards on the conduct of its business.The actual amount of cash OPCO has available for distribution also depends on other factors, such as:•the level of capital and operating expenditures it makes, including for maintaining and replacing drilling units or modifying existing drilling units to meet customer requirements and complying with regulations or to upgrade technology on the Company’s drilling units;•its debt service requirements, including fluctuations in interest rates, and restrictions on distributions contained in its debt instruments;•fluctuations in its working capital needs;•number of days of rig downtime or less than full utilization, which would result in a reduction of revenues under a drilling contract;•whether the Company or OPCO exercises any options to purchase drilling units in the future that are required to be offered to the Company or OPCO by Seadrill pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Agreement or otherwise;•the ability to make working capital borrowings and availability under the sponsor credit facility; and•the amount of any cash reserves, including reserves for future maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, working capital and other matters, established by the Company's board of directors.OPCO’s operating agreements provide that it will distribute its available cash to its owners on a quarterly basis. OPCO’s available cash includes cash on hand less any reserves that may be appropriate for operating its business. The amount of OPCO’s quarterly distributions, including the amount of cash reserves not distributed, is determined by the Company's board of directors.2Table of ContentsThe amount of cash OPCO generates from operations may differ materially from its profit or loss for the period, which is affected by non-cash items. As a result of this and the other factors mentioned above, OPCO may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net income.The Company may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses to enable the Company to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on its common units and subordinated units.The source of the Company's earnings and cash flow consists exclusively of cash distributions from OPCO. Therefore, the amount of cash distributions the Company is able to make to the Company's unitholders currently fluctuates, based on the level of distributions made by OPCO to its owners, including the Company, and, in the future, will fluctuate based on the level of cash distributions made by OPCO and any other subsidiaries through which the Company later conducts operations. OPCO or any such operating subsidiaries may make quarterly distributions at levels that will not permit the Company to make distributions to the Company's common unitholders at the minimum quarterly distribution level or to increase the Company's quarterly distributions in the future. In addition, while the Company would expect to increase or decrease distributions to the Company's unitholders if OPCO increases or decreases distributions to the Company, the timing and amount of any such increased or decreased distributions will not necessarily be comparable to the timing and amount of the increase or decrease in distributions made by OPCO to the Company.The Company's ability to distribute to its unitholders any cash it may receive from OPCO or any future operating subsidiaries is or may be limited by a number of factors, including, among others:•interest expense and principal payments on any indebtedness the Company may incur;•restrictions on distributions contained in any of the Company's current or future debt agreements;•fees and expenses of the Company, the Seadrill Member, its affiliates or third parties the Company is required to reimburse or pay, including expenses the Company incurs as a result of being a public company; and•reserves the Company's board of directors believes are prudent for the Company to maintain for the proper conduct of its business or to provide for future distributions.Many of these factors will reduce the amount of cash the Company may otherwise have available for distribution. The Company may not be able to pay distributions, and any distributions the Company makes may not be at or above the Company's minimum quarterly distribution. The actual amount of cash that is available for distribution to the Company's unitholders depends on several factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control.The Company's ability to grow may be adversely affected by its cash distribution policy. OPCO’s ability to meet its financial needs and grow may be adversely affected by its cash distribution policy.The Company's cash distribution policy, which is consistent with the Company's operating agreement, requires the Company to distribute all of the Company's available cash each quarter. Accordingly, the Company's growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.In determining the amount of cash available for distribution by OPCO, the Company's board of directors will approve the amount of cash reserves to set aside for the Company and OPCO, including reserves for anticipated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, working capital and other matters. OPCO will also rely upon external financing sources, including commercial borrowings, to fund its capital expenditures. Accordingly, to the extent OPCO does not have sufficient cash reserves or is unable to obtain financing, its cash distribution policy may significantly impair its ability to meet its financial needs or to grow.The Company must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of its fleet, which will reduce cash available for distribution. In addition, each quarter the Company is required to deduct estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures from operating surplus, which may result in less cash available to unitholders than if actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures were deducted.The Company must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to maintain and replace, over the long-term, the operating capacity, of its fleet. Maintenance and replacement capital expenditures include capital expenditures for maintenance (including special classification surveys) and capital expenditures associated with modifying an existing drilling unit, including to upgrade its technology, acquiring a new drilling unit or otherwise replacing current drilling units at the end of their useful lives to the extent these expenditures are incurred to maintain or replace the operating capacity of the Company’s fleet. These expenditures could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could increase as a result of changes in:•the cost of labor and materials;•customer requirements;•fleet size;•the cost of replacement drilling units;•the cost of replacement parts for existing drilling units;•the geographic location of the drilling units;3Table of Contents•length of drilling contracts;•governmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization and technical standards relating to safety, security or the environment; and•industry standards.The Company's operating agreement requires its board of directors to deduct estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, instead of actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, from operating surplus each quarter in an effort to reduce fluctuations in operating surplus as a result of variations in actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures each quarter. The amount of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures deducted from operating surplus is subject to review and change by the conflicts committee of the Company's board of directors at least once a year. In years when estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures are higher than actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders will be lower than if actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures were deducted from operating surplus. If the board of directors underestimates the appropriate level of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, the Company may have less cash available for distribution in future periods when actual capital expenditures exceed the Company's previous estimates.If capital expenditures are financed through cash from operations or by issuing debt or equity securities, the Company's ability to make cash distributions may be diminished, its financial leverage could increase or its unitholders could be diluted.Use of cash from operations to expand or maintain the Company’s fleet will reduce cash available for the Company to distribute to its unitholders. The Company's ability to obtain bank financing or to access debt and equity capital markets may be limited by the Company's financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering as well as by adverse market conditions resulting from, among other things, general economic conditions, changes in the offshore drilling industry and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond the Company's control. Failure to obtain the funds for future capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition and on the Company's ability to make cash distributions. Even if the Company is successful in obtaining necessary funds, the terms of any debt financings could limit the Company’s ability to pay distributions to unitholders. In addition, incurring additional debt may significantly increase the Company's interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing additional equity securities may result in significant unitholder dilution and would increase the aggregate amount of cash required to pay the minimum quarterly distribution to unitholders, both of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to make cash distributions.The Company’s debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing, pursuing other business opportunities and paying distributions to unitholders.As of December 31, 2014, the Company's consolidated debt was approximately $3,650 million. The Company has the ability to incur additional debt. Please read Item 5 “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”The Company’s level of debt could have important consequences to it, including the following:•the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be limited or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;•a substantial portion of the Company's cash flow will be required to make principal (including amortization payments as required by financing agreements) and interest payments on debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions to unitholders;•such debt may make the Company more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally than the Company's competitors with less debt; and•such debt may limit the Company’s flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.The Company's ability to service its consolidated debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond its control. If the Company's operating results are not sufficient to service its consolidated current or future indebtedness, the Company will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying its business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing the Company's consolidated debt, or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. The Company may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms, or at all.Furthermore, the Company’s financing agreements contain cross-default clauses which are linked to other indebtedness of Seadrill. In the event of a default by Seadrill under one of its other credit facilities, the Company could be adversely affected by the cross-default clauses, even if Seadrill cures any such default.Financing agreements containing operating and financial restrictions and other covenants may restrict the Company's business and financing activities.The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the financing agreements of Seadrill, or the Company and any future financing agreements of Seadrill or the Company, could adversely affect the Company's ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage, expand or 4Table of Contentspursue the Company's business activities. For example, subject to certain exceptions, the financing agreements may restrict the Company's ability to:•enter into other financing agreements;•incur additional indebtedness;•create or permit liens on the Company's respective assets;•sell drilling units or the capital stock of the Company's respective subsidiaries;•change the nature of the Company's business;•make investments;•pay distributions to the Company's unitholders or to the Company, respectively;•change the management and/or ownership of the drilling units;•make capital expenditures; and•compete effectively to the extent the Company's competitors are subject to less onerous restrictions.For more information, please read Item 5 “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”The Company’s ability to comply with the restrictions and covenants, including financial ratios and tests, contained in any financing agreements of Seadrill or the Company is dependent on future performance and may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If the Company is unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing its indebtedness or in current or future debt financing agreements, there could be a default under the terms of those agreements. Seadrill’s obligations under its facilities in which the Company participates could exceed the indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries under such agreements. If a default occurs under these agreements, lenders could terminate their commitments to lend and/or accelerate the outstanding loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. The Company has pledged its drilling units as security either under the Company's financing facilities or under Seadrill’s financing facilities in which the Company participates. If the Company's or Seadrill’s lenders were to foreclose on the Company’s drilling units in the event of a default, this may adversely affect the Company’s ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in, expand or pursue its business activities. In addition, all of the Company’s loan agreements contain cross-default provisions, meaning that if the Company is in default under one of its loan agreements, amounts outstanding under its other loan agreements may also be accelerated and become due and payable. If any of these events occur, the Company cannot guarantee that the Company’s assets will be sufficient to repay in full all of its outstanding indebtedness, and the Company may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if the Company could obtain alternative financing, that financing might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable. Any of these events would adversely affect its ability to make distributions to the Company's unitholders and cause a decline in the market price of the Company's common units. Please read Item 5 “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Restrictions in the Company’s debt agreements may prevent it or the Company from paying distributions.The payment of principal and interest on the Company’s debt will reduce cash available for distribution to the Company and to its unitholders. In addition, the Company’s current financing agreements contain provisions that, upon the occurrence of certain events, permit lenders to terminate their commitments and/or accelerate the outstanding loans and declare all amounts due and payable, which may prevent the Company from paying distributions to its unitholders. These events include, among others:•a failure to pay any principal, interest, fees, expenses or other amounts when due;•a violation of covenants requiring the Company to maintain certain levels of insurance coverage, minimum liquidity levels, minimum interest coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios and minimum current ratios;•a default under any other provision of the financing agreements, as well as a default under any provision of related security documents;•a material breach of any representation or warranty contained in the applicable financing agreement;•a default under other indebtedness;•a failure to comply with a final legal judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction;•a bankruptcy or insolvency event;•a suspension or cessation of the Company's business;•the destruction or abandonment of the Company's assets, or the seizure or appropriation thereof by any governmental, regulatory or other authority if the lenders determine such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or the Company's ability to satisfy the Company's obligations under or otherwise comply with the applicable financing agreement;•the invalidity, unlawfulness or repudiation of any financing agreement or related security document;•an enforcement of any liens or other encumbrances covering the Company's assets; and5Table of Contents•the occurrence of certain other events that the lenders believe is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or its ability to satisfy its obligations under or otherwise comply with the applicable financing agreement.OPCO is party to a $100 million revolving credit facility with Seadrill, as the lender, which referred to herein as the "sponsor credit facility". The sponsor credit facility contains customary covenants and provisions relating to events of default. Furthermore, the Company expects that its future financing agreements will contain similar provisions. For more information regarding these financing agreements, please read Item 5 “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Borrowing Activities.”Seadrill’s failure to comply with covenants and other provisions in its existing or future financing agreements could result in cross-defaults under the Company’s existing financing agreements, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.The Company’s existing financing agreements contain cross-default provisions that may be triggered if Seadrill defaults under the terms of its existing or future financing agreements. In turn, Seadrill’s existing financing arrangements contain cross-default provisions that may be triggered if its key subsidiaries, including North Atlantic Drilling Ltd. and Sevan Drilling ASA, default under the terms of their existing or future financing arrangements. In addition Seadrill also consolidates certain Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) owned by Ship Finance International Limited (NYSE: SFL), or Ship Finance. Seadrill's cross-default provisions could also be triggered if Ship Finance or one of the consolidated VIEs breached the terms of their financing arrangements. In the event of a default by Seadrill under one of its financing agreements, the lenders under the Company’s existing financing agreements could determine that the Company is in default under its financing agreements. This could result in the acceleration of the maturity of such debt under these agreements and the lenders thereunder may foreclose upon any collateral securing that debt, including the Company’s drilling units, even if Seadrill were to subsequently cure its default. In the event of such acceleration and foreclosure, the Company might not have sufficient funds or other assets to satisfy all of its obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition and would significantly reduce its ability, or make it unable, to make distributions to the Company's unitholders for so long as such default is continuing.The failure to consummate or integrate acquisitions in a timely and cost-effective manner could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.The Company believes that acquisition opportunities may arise from time to time, and any such acquisition could be significant. Under the Company's omnibus agreement with Seadrill, subject to certain exceptions Seadrill is obligated to offer to the Company any of its drilling units acquired or placed under drilling contracts of five or more years. Although the Company is not obligated to purchase any of these drilling units offered by Seadrill, any acquisition could involve the payment by the Company of a substantial amount of cash, the incurrence of a substantial amount of debt or the issuance of a substantial amount of equity. Certain acquisition and investment opportunities may not result in the consummation of a transaction. In addition, the Company may not be able to obtain acceptable terms for the required financing for any such acquisition or investment that arises. The Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that any announcement or consummation of an acquisition would have on the trading price of its common units. The Company's future acquisitions could present a number of risks, including the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets, the risk of failing to successfully and timely integrate the operations or management of any acquired businesses or assets and the risk of diverting management’s attention from existing operations or other priorities. The Company may also be subject to additional costs related to compliance with various international laws in connection with such acquisition. If the Company fails to consummate and integrate its acquisitions in a timely and cost-effective manner, its financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution could be adversely affected.The Company's growth depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by, among other things, volatile oil and gas prices, and may be materially and adversely affected by a decline in the offshore oil and gas industry.The offshore drilling industry is cyclical and volatile. The Company's growth strategy focuses on expansion in the offshore drilling sector, which depends on the level of activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production in offshore areas worldwide. The availability of quality drilling prospects, exploration success, relative production costs, the stage of reservoir development and political and regulatory environments affect customers’ drilling programs. Oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in these prices also significantly affect this level of activity and demand for drilling units.Oil and gas prices are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond the Company's control, including the following:•worldwide production and demand for oil and gas;•the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and gas;•expectations regarding future energy prices;•advances in exploration, development and production technology;•the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to set and maintain levels and pricing;•the level of production in non-OPEC countries;•government regulations, including restrictions on offshore transportation of oil and gas;•local and international political, economic and weather conditions;•domestic and foreign tax policies;•development and exploitation of alternative fuels;•the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves;6Table of Contents•accidents, severe weather, natural disasters and other similar incidents relating to the oil and gas industry; and•the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in the Middle East, Eastern Europe or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the United States, or elsewhere.Declines in oil and gas prices for an extended period of time, or market expectations of potential decreases in these prices, could negatively affect the Company's future growth. Sustained periods of low oil and gas prices typically result in reduced exploration and drilling because oil and gas companies’ capital expenditure budgets are subject to cash flow from such activities and are therefore sensitive to changes in energy prices. These changes in commodity prices can have a dramatic effect on rig demand, and periods of low demand can cause excess rig supply and intensify the competition in the industry which often results in drilling rigs, particularly older and less technologically-advanced drilling rigs, being idle for long periods of time. The Company cannot predict the future level of demand for drilling rigs or future conditions of the oil and gas industry. In response to the recent decrease in the prices of oil and gas, a number of the Company's oil and gas company customers have recently announced decreases in budgeted expenditures for offshore drilling. Any future decrease in exploration, development or production expenditures by oil and gas companies could reduce the Company's revenues and materially harm its business, results of operations and cash available for distribution.In addition to oil and gas prices, the offshore drilling industry is influenced by additional factors, including:•the availability of competing offshore drilling rigs;•the level of costs for associated offshore oilfield and construction services;•oil and gas transportation costs;•the level of rig operating costs including crew and maintenance;•the discovery of new oil and gas reserves; and•regulatory restrictions on offshore drilling.Any of these factors could reduce demand for drilling rigs and adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.The current downturn in activity in the oil and gas drilling industry has had and is likely to continue to have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.The oil and gas drilling industry is cyclical, and the industry has entered a downcycle. Crude oil prices have fallen during the past year. The price of Brent crude has fallen from over $100 per barrel in March 2014, to approximately $56 per barrel as of March 31, 2015. In response to the recent decrease in the prices of oil and gas, a number of our oil and gas company customers have recently announced decreases in budgeted expenditures for offshore drilling. Declines in capital spending levels, coupled with additional newbuild supply, have and are likely to continue to put significant pressure on dayrates and utilization. The decline and the perceived risk of a further decline in oil and/or gas prices could cause oil and gas companies to further reduce their overall level of activity or spending, in which case demand for our services may further decline and revenues may continue to be adversely affected through lower drilling unit utilization and/or lower dayrates. Historically, when drilling activity and spending decline, utilization and dayrates also decline and drilling has been reduced or discontinued, resulting in an oversupply of drilling units. The recent oversupply of drilling units will be exacerbated by the entry of newbuild rigs into the market. The supply of available uncontracted units has and is likely to further intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur and additional contracts terminate without renewal and lead to a reduction in dayrates as the active fleet grows. If we are unable to secure contracts for our drilling units upon the expiration of our existing contracts, we may idle or stack our units. When idled or stacked, drilling units do not earn revenues, but continue to require cash expenditures for crews, fuel, insurance, berthing and associated items. We currently have no units idled or stacked. However, the West Sirius drilling contract has been recently terminated, and we anticipate that this drilling unit will be idle or stacked following the estimated completion of the contract in May 2015. In addition the drilling contract for the West Vencedor will expire during the second quarter of 2015, and this drilling unit could also be idled or stacked. We have not yet secured a new contract for either of these drilling units. If our lenders are not confident that we are able to employ our assets, we may be unable to secure additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In general, drilling unit owners are bidding for available work extremely competitively with a focus on utilization over returns, which has and will likely continue to drive rates down to or below cash breakeven levels. To maintain the continued employment of our units, we may also accept contracts at lower dayrates or on less favorable terms due to market conditions. In addition, customers have already and may in the future request renegotiation of existing contracts to lower dayrates. In an over-supplied market, we may have limited bargaining power to renegotiate on more favorable terms. Lower utilization and dayrates have and will adversely affect our revenues and profitability. The effects of the downcycle may have other impacts on our business as well. Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could result in a reduction in the market value of our drilling units or goodwill. This could lead to the recognition of impairment charges on our drilling units or goodwill if future cash flow estimates, based on information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these drilling units or goodwill may not be recoverable. In addition, if the market value of our drilling units decreases, and we sell any drilling unit at a time when prices for drilling units have fallen, such a sale may result in a loss, which would negatively affect our results of operations. 7Table of ContentsProlonged periods of low dayrates, the possible termination or loss of contracts and reduced values of our drilling units could negatively impact our ability to comply with certain financial covenants under the terms of our debt agreements. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants, including meeting financial ratios and tests, is dependent on our future performance and may be affected by events beyond our control. If a default occurs under these agreements, lenders could terminate their commitments to lend or in some circumstances accelerate the outstanding loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. In addition, our existing debt agreements contain cross-default provisions. In the event of a default by us under one of our debt agreements, the lenders under our other existing debt agreements could determine that we are in default under our other financing agreements. This could lead to an acceleration and enforcement of such agreements by our lenders.We do not know when the market for offshore drilling units may recover, or the nature or extent of any future recovery. There can be no assurance that the current demand for drilling rigs will not further decline in future periods. The continued or future decline in demand for drilling rigs would adversely affect our financial position, operating results and cash flows.The Company depends on certain subsidiaries of Seadrill, including Seadrill Management, to assist the Company in operating and expanding the business.The Company's ability to enter into new drilling contracts and expand its customer and supplier relationships will depend largely on its ability to leverage its relationship with Seadrill and its reputation and relationships in the offshore drilling industry. If Seadrill suffers material damage to its reputation or relationships, it may harm the Company's ability to:•renew existing drilling contracts upon their expiration;•obtain new drilling contracts;•efficiently and productively carry out the Company's drilling activities;•successfully interact with shipyards;•obtain financing and maintain insurance on commercially acceptable terms;•maintain access to capital under the sponsor credit facility; or•maintain satisfactory relationships with suppliers and other third parties.In addition, pursuant to the management and administrative services agreements, Seadrill Management provides the Company with significant management, administrative, financial and other support services and/or personnel. Subsidiaries of Seadrill also provide advisory, technical and administrative services to the Company’s fleet pursuant to advisory, technical and administrative services agreements. The Company's operational success and ability to execute the Company's growth strategy depends significantly upon the satisfactory performance of these services. The Company's business will be harmed if Seadrill and its subsidiaries fail to perform these services satisfactorily, if they cancel their agreements with the Company or if they stop providing these services to it. Please read Item 7 “Major Unitholders and Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions.”The Company’s drilling contracts may not permit it to fully recoup its costs in the event of a rise in expenses.The Company’s drilling contracts have dayrates that are fixed over the contract term. In order to mitigate the effects of inflation on revenues from these term contracts, all of the Company’s drilling contracts, except for the West Leo include escalation provisions. These provisions allow the Company to adjust the dayrates based on certain published indices. These indices are designed to compensate the Company for certain cost increases, including wages, insurance and maintenance costs. However, actual cost increases may result from events or conditions that do not cause correlative changes to the applicable indices. Furthermore, certain indices are updated semi-annually, and therefore may be outdated at the time of adjustment. In addition, the adjustments are normally performed on a semi-annual or annual basis. For these reasons, the timing and amount received as a result of the adjustments may differ from the timing and amount of expenditures associated with actual cost increases, which could adversely affect the Company's cash flow and ability to make cash distributions.An increase in operating and maintenance costs could materially and adversely affect the Company's financial performance.The Company's operating expenses and maintenance costs depend on a variety of factors including crew costs, provisions, equipment, insurance, maintenance and repairs and shipyard costs, many of which are beyond the Company's control and affect the entire offshore drilling industry. During periods after which a rig becomes idle, the Company may decide to “warm stack” the rig, which means the rig is kept fully operational and ready for redeployment, and maintains most of its crew. As a result, the Company's operating expenses during a warm stacking will not be substantially different than those the Company would incur if the rig remained active. The Company may also decide to “cold stack” the rig, which means the rig is stored in a harbor, shipyard or a designated offshore area, and the crew is assigned to an active rig or dismissed. However, reductions in costs following the decision to cold stack a rig may not be immediate, as a portion of the crew may be required to prepare the rig for such storage. Moreover, as the rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly. Operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues. Operating revenues may fluctuate as a function of changes in supply of offshore drilling rigs and demand for contract drilling services, which in turn, affect dayrates, and the economic utilization and performance of the Company’s fleet of drilling rigs. However, operating costs are generally related to the number of drilling rigs in operation and the cost level in each country or region where such drilling rigs are located. In addition, equipment maintenance costs fluctuate depending upon the type of activity that the drilling rig is performing and the age and condition of the equipment. Escalation provisions contained in the Company’s drilling contracts may not be adequate to substantially mitigate these increased operating and maintenance costs. In connection with new assignments, the Company might incur expenses relating to preparation for operations under a new contract. The expenses may vary based on the scope and length of such required preparations and the duration of the contractual period over which such expenditures are amortized. In situations where the Company’s drilling units incur idle time between 8Table of Contentsassignments, the opportunity to reduce the size of its crews on those drilling units is limited as the crews will be engaged in preparing the drilling unit for its next contract. When a drilling unit faces longer idle periods, reductions in costs may not be immediate as some of the crew may be required to prepare drilling units for stacking and maintenance in the stacking period. Should drilling units be idle for a longer period, the Company may not be successful in redeploying crew members, who are not required to maintain the drilling units, and therefore may not be successful in reducing the Company's costs in such cases.Any limitation in the availability or operation of the Company’s drilling units could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition and could significantly reduce the Company's ability to make distributions to its unitholders.As at March 31, 2015, the Company’s fleet consisted of four semi-submersible drilling rigs, three drillships and three tender rigs. If any of the Company’s drilling units are unable to generate revenues as a result of the expiration or termination of its drilling contracts or sustained periods of downtime, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Some of the Company’s customers have the right to terminate their drilling contracts without cause upon the payment of an early termination fee. However, such payments may not fully compensate the Company for the loss of the drilling contract. Under certain circumstances the Company’s contracts may permit customers to terminate contracts early without the payment of any termination fees as a result of non-performance, total loss of the rigs, extended periods of downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues, or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events beyond the Company’s control. During periods of challenging market conditions, the Company may be subject to an increased risk of its customers seeking to repudiate their contracts, including through claims of non-performance. The Company’s customers’ ability to perform their obligations under their drilling contracts may also be negatively impacted by the prevailing uncertainty surrounding the development of the world economy and the credit markets. If a customer cancels its contract, and the Company is unable to secure a new contract on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if a contract is suspended for an extended period of time or if a contract is renegotiated on different terms, it could adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition and may reduce the amount of cash the Company has available to distribute to the Company and that the Company has available for distribution to its unitholders. For more information regarding the termination provisions of the Company’s drilling contracts, please read Item 4 “Information on the Company—Business Overview—Drilling Contracts.”The Company currently derives all its revenue from four customers, and the loss of any of these customers could result in a significant loss of revenues and cash flow.The Company currently derives all of its revenues and cash flow from four customers. For the year ended December 31, 2014, BP accounted for 41.5%, Tullow accounted for 17.4%, ExxonMobil(*) accounted for 26.4% and Chevron accounted for 14.7% of total revenues, respectively. All of the Company’s drilling contracts have fixed terms, but may be terminated early due to certain events or might nevertheless be lost in the event of unanticipated developments, such as the deterioration in the general business or financial condition of a customer, resulting in its inability meet its obligations under its contracts with the Company. The Company's contract with Chevron relating to the West Vencedor will expire early in the second quarter of 2015, no subsequent employment has been obtained for the West Vencedor. (* During 2013 and 2014 the ExxonMobil drilling contract was assigned to Hibernia Management and Development Co. Ltd and Statoil Canada Ltd.). On March 30, 2015 the Company received a notice of termination from BP for the contract for the West Sirius which will be effective after having completed the current well and demobilization, which the Company estimates to be by early May 2015. No subsequent employment has been obtained for the West Sirius.If any of the Company’s drilling contracts are terminated, the Company may be unable to re-deploy the drilling unit subject to such terminated contract on terms as favorable to it as its current drilling contracts. If the Company is unable to re-deploy a drilling unit for which the drilling contract has been terminated, the Company may not receive any revenues from that drilling unit (other than termination fees), but it will be required to pay expenses necessary to maintain the drilling unit in proper operating condition. This will cause the Company to receive decreased revenues and cash flows from having fewer drilling units operating in its fleet. The loss of any customers, drilling contracts or drilling units, or a decline in payments under any of the Company’s drilling contracts, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to the Company's unitholders.In addition, the Company's drilling contracts subject it to counterparty risks. The ability of each of the Company's counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with the Company depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company's control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the offshore drilling industry, prevailing prices for oil and gas, the overall financial condition of the counterparty, the dayrates received for specific types of drilling units and the level of expenses necessary to maintain drilling activities. In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company's customers may no longer need a drilling unit that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable drilling unit at a lower dayrate. Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under an agreement with the Company, the Company could sustain losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.The Company may not be able to renew or obtain new and favorable contracts for drilling units whose contracts are expiring or are terminated, which could adversely affect its revenues and profitability.The Company’s ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new contracts will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the time which may vary among different geographic regions, different types of drilling units, and specific conditions. If the Company is not able to obtain new contracts in direct continuation with existing contracts, or if new contracts are entered into at dayrates substantially below the existing dayrates or on terms otherwise less favorable compared to existing contract terms, its revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.9Table of ContentsThe offshore drilling markets in which the Company competes experience fluctuations in the demand for drilling services, as measured by the level of exploration and development expenditures and supply of capable drilling equipment. The Company's contract with Chevron relating to the West Vencedor will expire early in the second quarter of 2015, no subsequent employment has been obtained for the West Vencedor. In March 2015 the Company received a notice of termination from BP for the contract for the West Sirius which will be effective after having completed the current well and demobilization, which the Company estimates to be in May 2015. No subsequent employment has been obtained for the West Sirius.The existing drilling contracts for the remainder of the Company's drilling units , are scheduled to expire from April 2017 through November 2020. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to obtain contracts for the its drilling units upon the expiration or termination of their current contracts or that there will not be a gap in employment of the rigs between current contracts and subsequent contracts. In particular, if oil and gas prices are low as they are currently, or it is expected that such prices will remain low or decrease in the future, at a time when the Company is seeking to arrange contracts for the its drilling units, the Company may not be able to obtain drilling contracts at attractive dayrates or at all.If the dayrates which the Company receives for the reemployment of the Company's current drilling units are less favorable, the Company will recognize less revenue from their operations. The Company's ability to meet its cash flow obligations will depend on the Company's ability to consistently secure drilling contracts for the Company's drilling units at sufficiently high dayrates. The Company cannot predict the future level of demand for the Company's services or future conditions in the oil and gas industry. If oil and gas companies do not increase exploration, development and production expenditures, the Company may have difficulty securing drilling contracts, or the Company may be forced to enter into contracts at unattractive dayrates, which would adversely affect the Company's ability to make distributions to the Company's unitholders.Competition within the offshore drilling industry may adversely affect us.The offshore drilling industry is highly competitive and fragmented and includes several large companies that compete in the markets the Company serves, as well as smaller companies. Offshore drilling contracts are generally awarded on a competitive bid basis or through privately negotiated transactions. In determining which qualified drilling contractor is awarded a contract, the key factors are pricing, rig availability, rig location, condition and integrity of equipment, its record of operating efficiency, including high operating uptime, technical specifications, safety performance record, crew experience, reputation, industry standing and customer relations. The Company’s operations may be adversely affected if its current competitors or new market entrants introduce new drilling units with better features, performance, price or other characteristics in comparison to the Company’s drilling units, or expand into service areas where the Company operates. In addition, mergers among oil and gas exploration and production companies have reduced, and may from time to time further reduce, the number of available customers, which would increase the ability of potential customers to achieve pricing terms favorable to them. The offshore drilling industry has historically been cyclical and is impacted by oil and gas price levels and volatility. There have been periods of high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates, followed by periods of low demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates. Changes in commodity prices can have a dramatic effect on rig demand, and periods of excess rig supply may intensify competition in the industry and result in the idling of older and less technologically advanced equipment. The Company may in the future idle or stack rigs or enter into lower dayrate drilling contracts in response to market conditions. The Company cannot predict when or if any idled or stacked rigs will return to service.Competitive pressures and other factors may result in significant price competition, particularly during industry downturns, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to the Company's unitholders.An economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on the Company's revenue, profitability and financial position.The Company depend on its customers' willingness and ability to fund operating and capital expenditures to explore, develop and produce oil and gas, and to purchase drilling and related equipment. There has historically been a strong link between the development of the world economy and demand for energy, including oil and gas. The world economy is currently facing a number of challenges. Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations and the overall stability of the euro. An extended period of adverse development in the outlook for European countries could reduce the overall demand for oil and gas and for the Company's services. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could affect the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash available for distribution. This includes uncertainty surrounding the sovereign debt and credit crises in certain European countries. In addition, turmoil and hostilities in Korea, Ukraine, the Middle East, North Africa and other geographic areas and countries are adding to overall risk. In addition, worldwide financial and economic conditions could severely restrict the Company's ability to access the capital markets at a time when the Company would like, or need, to access such markets, which could impact the Company's ability to react to changing economic and business conditions. Worldwide economic conditions have in the past impacted, and could in the future impact, the lenders participating in the Company's credit facilities. Such economic conditions could also impact lenders participating in the credit facilities of the Company's customers, causing those customers to fail to meet their obligations to the Company. In addition, a portion of the credit under the Company's credit facilities is provided by European banking institutions. If economic conditions in Europe preclude or limit financing from these banking institutions, the Company may not be able to obtain financing from other institutions on terms that are acceptable, or at all, even if conditions outside Europe remain favorable for lending. An extended period of adverse development in the outlook for the world economy could reduce the overall demand for oil and gas and for the Company's services. Such changes could adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to the Company's unitholders.10Table of ContentsThe current state of global financial markets and current economic conditions may adversely impact the Company's ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms which may hinder or prevent the Company from expanding the Company's business.Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile. The current state of global financial markets and current economic conditions might adversely impact the Company's ability to issue additional equity at prices which will not be dilutive to the Company's existing unitholders or preclude the Company from issuing equity at all. The Company cannot be certain that additional financing will be available if needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If additional financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, the Company may be unable to meet the Company's obligations as they come due or the Company may be unable to expand the Company's existing business, complete drilling unit acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.The Company's current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be ultimately realized.As of March 31, 2015, the Company's backlog of contract drilling revenues under firm commitments was approximately $5.2 billion. The actual amount of revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned may differ from the stated amounts and periods due to shipyard and maintenance projects, downtime and other events within or beyond the Company’s control. In addition, the Company's customers may seek to cancel or renegotiate the Company's contracts for various reasons, including those described under “—Certain work stoppages or maintenance or repair work may cause the Company’s customers to suspend or reduce payment of dayrates until operation of the respective rig is resumed, which may lead to termination or renegotiation of important agreements.”and under "---The Company's growth depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by, among other things, volatile oil and gas prices, and may be materially and adversely affected by a decline in the offshore oil and gas industry." In addition, some of the Company's customers could experience liquidity issues or could otherwise be unable or unwilling to perform under the contract, which could ultimately lead a customer to go into bankruptcy or to otherwise encourage a customer to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate a contract. The Company's inability or the inability of the Company's customers to perform under the Company's or their contractual obligations could adversely affect the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash available for distribution.Failure to obtain or retain highly skilled personnel could adversely affect the Company’s operations.The Company believes that competition for skilled and other labor required for the Company’s drilling operations has increased in recent years as the number of rigs activated or added to worldwide fleets has increased. The number of rigs in operation is continuing to grow as new units are being delivered. Furthermore, additional rigs currently under construction are expected to increase the future demand for offshore drilling crews. In some regions such as Angola and Nigeria, limited availability of qualified personnel, in combination with local regulations focusing on crew composition, is expected to further increase demand for qualified offshore drilling crews, which may increase costs. A continued expansion of the rig fleet, increased demand for drilling services in general, coupled with shortages of qualified personnel could further create and intensify upward pressure on wages and make it more difficult or costly for the Company to staff and service its rigs, or do so on economically viable terms. The current industry downturn may not provide relief from such pressures. Further, if substantial numbers of workers seek employment outside the offshore drilling industry as a result of the downturn, the competition for workers in the offshore drilling industry could remain high, or even increase, during the downturn. Such developments could adversely affect the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to the Company's unitholders. Furthermore, as a result of any increased competition for people and risk for higher turnover, the Company may experience a reduction in the experience level of its personnel, which could lead to higher downtime and more operating incidents.Certain work stoppages or maintenance or repair work may cause the Company’s customers to suspend or reduce payment of dayrates until operation of the respective drilling unit is resumed, which may lead to termination or renegotiation of the drilling contract.Compensation under the Company’s drilling contracts is based on daily performance and/or availability of each drilling unit in accordance with the requirements specified in the applicable drilling contract agreement. For instance, when the Company's drilling units are idle, but available for operation, the Company’s customers are entitled to pay a waiting rate lower than the operational rate.Several factors could cause an interruption of operations, including:•breakdowns of equipment and other unforeseen engineering problems;•work stoppages, including labor strikes;•shortages of material and skilled labor;•delays in repairs by suppliers;•surveys by government and maritime authorities;•periodic classification surveys;•severe weather, strong ocean currents or harsh operating conditions; and•force majeure events.In addition, if the Company’s drilling units are taken out of service for maintenance and repair for a period of time exceeding the scheduled maintenance periods set forth in its drilling contracts, the Company will not be entitled to payment of dayrates until the relevant rig is available for deployment. If the interruption of operations were to exceed a determined period due to an event of force majeure, the Company’s customers have the right to pay a rate (the “force majeure rate”) that is significantly lower than the waiting rate for a period of time, and, thereafter, may terminate the drilling contracts related to the subject rig. For more details on the Company’s drilling contracts, see Item 4 “Information on the 11Table of ContentsCompany—Business Overview—Drilling Contracts” and Item 5 “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Important Financial and Operational Terms and Concepts—Contracted Revenues and Dayrates.” Suspension of drilling contract payments, prolonged payment of reduced rates or termination of any drilling contract agreements as a result of an interruption of operations as described herein could materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to the Company's unitholders.Labor costs and operating restrictions that apply to the Company could increase as a result of collective bargaining negotiations and changes in labor laws and regulations.A significant portion of the Company’s employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements. The majority of these employees work in Canada, Nigeria and Angola. As part of the legal obligations in some of these agreements, the Company is required to contribute certain amounts to retirement funds and pension plans and is restricted in its ability to dismiss employees. In addition, many of these represented individuals are working under agreements that are subject to salary negotiation. These negotiations could result in higher personnel costs, other increased costs or increased operating restrictions that could adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions.An inability to obtain visas and work permits for drilling unit personnel on a timely basis could hurt its operations and have an adverse effect on the Company's business.The Company’s ability to operate worldwide depends on obtaining the necessary visas and work permits for the personnel on its drilling units to travel in and out of, and to work in, the jurisdictions in which it operates. Governmental actions in some of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates may make it difficult to move personnel in and out of these jurisdictions by delaying or withholding the approval of these visa and work permits. If visas and work permits cannot be obtained for the employees needed for operating the Company’s rigs on a timely basis or for third-party technicians needed for maintenance or repairs, the Company might not be able to perform its obligations under its drilling contracts, which could lead to periods of prolonged downtime or allow the Company’s customers to cancel the contracts. Any such downtime or cancellation could adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to the Company's unitholders.The Company’s business and operations involve numerous operating hazards, and its insurance and indemnities from its customers may not be adequate to cover potential losses from its operations.The Company’s operations are subject to hazards inherent in the offshore drilling industry, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment defects, craterings, fires, explosions and pollution. Contract drilling requires the use of heavy equipment and exposure to hazardous conditions, which may subject the Company to liability claims by employees, customers and third parties. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, claims by third parties or customers and suspension of operations. The Company’s offshore fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on-site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, piracy, damage from severe weather and marine life infestations. Operations may also be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages. The Company customarily provides contract indemnity to its customers for claims that could be asserted by the Company relating to damage to or loss of the Company's equipment, including rigs, and claims that could be asserted by the Company or its employees relating to personal injury or loss of life.Damage to the environment could also result from the Company’s operations, particularly through spillage of hydrocarbons, fuel, lubricants or other chemicals and substances used in drilling operations, or extensive uncontrolled fires. The Company may also be subject to property damage, environmental indemnity and other claims by oil and gas companies. The Company’s insurance policies and drilling contracts contain rights to indemnity that may not adequately cover its losses, and the Company does not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks. There are certain risks, including risks associated with the loss of control of a well (such as blowout, cratering, the cost to regain control of or re-drill the well and remediation of associated pollution), against which the Company’s customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify the Company. In addition, a court may decide that certain indemnities in the Company’s current or future contracts are not enforceable. For example, in a 2012 case related to the fire and explosion that took place on the unaffiliated Deepwater Horizon Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, or the Deepwater Horizon Incident, (to which the Company was not a party), the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana invalidated certain contractual indemnities for punitive damages and for civil penalties under the US Clean Water Act under a drilling contract governed by U.S. maritime law as a matter of public policy. For example, in 2011, a U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Texas invalidated certain contractual indemnities for gross negligence in a drilling master services agreement governed by U.S. maritime law as a matter of public policy. The Company maintains insurance coverage for property damage, occupational injury and illness, and general and marine third-party liabilities (except as described below with respect to drilling units and equipment in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico). However, pollution and environmental risks generally are not totally insurable.The Company’s insurance provides for deductibles for damage to its offshore drilling equipment and third-party liabilities. With respect to hull and machinery, the Company’s insurance provides for a deductible per occurrence of $5 million for all of its fleet. However, in the event of a total loss or a constructive total loss of a drilling unit, such loss is fully covered by its insurance with no deductible. For general and marine third-party liabilities the Company’s insurance provides for up to a $500,000 deductible per occurrence on personal injury liability for crew claims as well as non-crew claims and per occurrence on third-party property damage.If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by the Company’s insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a customer, the occurrence could adversely affect the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash available for distribution. The amount of the Company’s insurance may also be less than the related impact on enterprise value after a loss. The Company’s insurance coverage will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect it from all liabilities that could result from its drilling operations. The 12Table of ContentsCompany’s coverage includes annual aggregate policy limits. As a result, the Company retains the risk for any losses in excess of these limits. Any such lack of reimbursement may cause the Company to incur substantial costs. In addition, the Company could decide to retain more risk in the future. This results in a higher risk of losses, which could be material, that are not covered by third-party insurance contracts. Specifically, the Company has at times in the past elected to not insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to the substantial costs associated with such coverage. The Company insures a limited part of this windstorm risk in a combined single limit annual aggregate policy. The Company is currently negotiating the renewal of its policy to insure a limited part of this windstorm risk for a further period starting May 1, 2015 through March 31, 2016. If the Company elects not to insure such risks in the future, and such windstorms cause significant damage to any rig and equipment the Company has in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Moreover, no assurance can be made that the Company will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that the Company considers reasonable, or obtain insurance against certain risks.An over-supply of drilling units may lead to a reduction in dayrates and therefore may materially impact the Company’s profitability.Prior to the current downturn, during the recent period of high utilization and high dayrates, industry participants have increased the supply of drilling units by ordering construction of new drilling units. Historically, this has resulted in an over-supply of drilling units and has caused a subsequent decline in utilization and dayrates when the drilling units have entered the market, sometimes for extended periods of time until the new units have been absorbed into the active fleet. As of March 31, 2015, the worldwide fleet of tender rigs, semi-submersible rigs and drillships consisted of 355 units, comprising 39 tender rigs, 198 semi-submersible rigs and 118 drillships. In addition there are 9 tender rigs, 30 semi-submersible rigs and 56 drillships were under construction or on order, which would bring the total fleet to 450 units, assuming no reduction in the total fleet size through retirement of drilling units or otherwise. A relatively large number of the drilling units currently under construction have not been contracted for future work, and a number of units in the existing worldwide fleet are currently off contract.The supply of available uncontracted units is likely to intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur and additional contracts terminate without renewal, and lead to a reduction in dayrates as the active fleet grows. Any further increase in construction of new units may increase the negative impact on dayrates and utilization. In addition, drilling units may be relocated to markets in which the Company operates, which could exacerbate excess drilling unit supply and lower dayrates in those markets. If a large number of drilling units become available around the time of expiration of the Company's drilling contracts, it could depress the dayrate the Company is able to obtain under a renewed or new contract with respect to the Company's drilling units. In addition, customers may demand renegotiation of existing contracts to lower dayrates. In an over-supplied market, the Company may have limited bargaining power to renegotiate on more favorable terms. Lower utilization and dayrates could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and profitability and ability to make distributions to its unitholders. In addition, prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on the Company’s drilling units if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these drilling units may not be recoverable.The market value of the Company’s existing drilling units has decreased and drilling units the Company may acquire in the future could decrease, which could cause the Company to incur losses if the Company decides to sell them following a decline in their market values.During the second half of 2014, the estimated fair value of the Company's drilling units, based upon various broker valuations, decreased by approximately 10%. If the offshore contract drilling industry suffers adverse developments in the future, the fair market value of the Company's drilling units may decline further. The fair market value of the drilling units that we currently own, or may acquire in the future, may increase or decrease depending on a number of factors, including:•general economic and market conditions affecting the offshore drilling industry, including competition from other offshore contract drilling companies;•types, sizes and ages of drilling units;•supply and demand for drilling units;•costs of newbuildings;•prevailing level of drilling services contract dayrates;•governmental or other regulations; and•technological advances.If the Company sells any drilling unit at a time when prices for drilling units have fallen, such a sale may result in a loss. Such a loss could materially and adversely affect the Company's business prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and ability to make distributions to its unitholders.The Company may incur impairment charges as a result of reduced demand for drilling services or other factorsIn the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges to goodwill or other assets. Such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance or results of operations, and its ability to pay distributions. In addition, such impairment charges could adversely impact the Company's ability to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the Company's debt agreements, including meeting financial ratios and tests in those agreements. If the Company is unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing its indebtedness or in current or future debt financing agreements, a default could occur under the terms of those agreements.13Table of ContentsConsolidation and governmental regulation of suppliers may increase the cost of obtaining supplies or restrict the Company’s ability to obtain needed supplies, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.The Company relies on certain third parties to provide supplies and services necessary for its offshore drilling operations, including but not limited to drilling equipment suppliers, catering and machinery suppliers. Recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers, resulting in fewer alternatives for sourcing key supplies. With respect to certain items, such as blow-out preventers, the Company is dependent upon the original equipment manufacturer for repair and replacement of the item or its spare parts. For instance, several drilling companies, including Seadrill, experienced significant interruption of operations in early 2013 as a result of a defective batch of connector bolts procured by a supplier of BOP equipment, and the only source of approved replacement bolts was that same supplier. Such consolidation, combined with a high volume of drilling units under construction, may result in a shortage of supplies and services thereby increasing the cost of supplies and/or potentially inhibiting the ability of suppliers to deliver on time. These cost increases or delays could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and result in rig downtime, and delays in the repair and maintenance of its drilling units. Furthermore, most of the Company's suppliers are U.S. companies, which means that in the event a U.S. supplier was debarred or otherwise restricted by the U.S. government from delivering its products the Company's ability to supply and service its operations in areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico subject to federal lease could be severely impacted.The Company’s international operations involve additional risks, which could adversely affect the Company's business.As a result of the Company’s international operations, the Company may be exposed to political and other uncertainties, including risks of:•terrorist acts, armed hostilities, war and civil disturbances;•acts of piracy, which have historically affected ocean-going drilling units trading in regions of the world such as the South China Sea, the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia, where piracy has increased significantly in frequency since 2008, and off the west coast of Africa;•significant governmental influence over many aspects of local economies;•seizure, nationalization or expropriation of property or equipment;•repudiation, nullification, modification or renegotiation of contracts;•limitations on insurance coverage, such as war risk coverage, in certain areas;•political unrest;•foreign and U.S. monetary policy and foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations;•the inability to repatriate income or capital;•complications associated with repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations;•import-export quotas, wage and price controls, imposition of trade barriers;•U.S. and foreign sanctions or trade embargoes;•regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions;•changing taxation policies, including confiscatory taxation;•other forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond the Company's control; and•governmental corruption.In addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations of the countries in which the Company operates, including laws and regulations relating to:•the equipping and operation of drilling units;•exchange rates or exchange controls;•oil and gas exploration and development;•taxation of offshore earnings and the earnings of expatriate personnel; and•use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors.It is difficult to predict what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry. The actions of foreign governments, including initiatives by OPEC, may adversely affect the Company's ability to compete. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to sanctions and export restrictions, may subject the Company to criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions or seizures of assets.14Table of ContentsIf the Company’s business activities involve countries, entities and individuals that are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments, the Company could be subject to enforcement action and the Company's reputation and the market for the Company's common units could be adversely affected.In 2010, the U.S. enacted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act, or CISADA, which expanded the scope of the former Iran Sanctions Act. Among other things, CISADA expands the application of the prohibitions to non-U.S. companies, such as the Company, and introduces limits on the ability of companies and persons to do business or trade with Iran when such activities relate to the investment, supply or export of refined petroleum or petroleum products. On August 10, 2012, the U.S. signed into law the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, or the Iran Threat Reduction Act, which places further restrictions on the ability of non-U.S. companies to do business or trade with Iran and Syria. Perhaps the most significant provision in the Iran Threat Reduction Act is that prohibitions in the existing Iran sanctions applicable to U.S. persons will now apply to any foreign entity owned or controlled by a U.S. person (essentially making the U.S. sanctions against Iran as expansive as U.S. sanctions against Cuba). These new sanctions were codified within the Iranian Transactions Regulations on or about December 26, 2012. The other major provision in the Iran Threat Reduction Act is that issuers of securities must disclose to the SEC in their annual and quarterly reports filed after February 6, 2013 if the issuer or “any affiliate” has “knowingly” engaged in certain sanctioned activities involving Iran during the timeframe covered by the report. The disclosure must describe the nature and extent of the activity in detail and the SEC will publish the disclosure on its website. The President must then initiate an investigation and determine whether sanctions on the issuer or its affiliate will be imposed. Such negative publicity and the possibility that sanctions could be imposed would present a risk for any issuer that is knowingly engaged in sanctioned conduct or that has an affiliate that is knowingly engaged in such conduct. At this time, the Company is not aware of any sanctionable activity, conducted by ourselves or by any affiliate of Seadrill that is likely to trigger an SEC disclosure requirement. Sanctions affecting non-U.S. companies like the Company were expanded yet again under the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, with the passage of the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act, and the Company believes that these sanctions will continue to become more restrictive for the foreseeable future. In addition to the sanctions against Iran, U.S. law continues to restrict U.S. owned or controlled entities from doing business with Cuba and various U.S. sanctions have certain other extraterritorial effects that need to be considered by non-U.S. companies. Moreover, any U.S. persons who serve as officers, directors or employees of the Company would be fully subject to U.S. sanctions. It should also be noted that other governments are more frequently implementing sanctions regimes. The Company does not currently have any drilling contracts or plans to initiate any drilling contracts involving operations in countries or with government-controlled entities that are subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and/or identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. However, from time to time, the Company may enter into drilling contracts involving operations in countries or with government-controlled entities that are subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and/or identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism in cases where entering into such contracts would not violate U.S. law or may enter into drilling contracts involving operations in countries or with government-controlled entities that may become subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and/or identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. However, this could negatively affect the Company's ability to obtain investors. In some cases, U.S. investors would be prohibited from investing in an arrangement in which the proceeds could directly or indirectly be transferred to or may benefit a sanctioned entity. Moreover, even in cases where the investment would not violate U.S. law, potential investors could view such drilling contracts negatively, which could adversely affect the Company's reputation and the market for the Company's common units. As stated above, the Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations, and intend to maintain such compliance. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be in compliance in the future, particularly as such laws are subject to frequent changes, the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. For instance, new sanctions were announced in March 2014 in relation to certain individuals in Russia and Ukraine, and subsequently modified in August and September 2014. Any such violation could result in fines or other penalties and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in the Company's common units. Additionally, some investors may decide to divest their interest, or not to invest, in the Company's common units simply because the Company may do business with companies that do business in sanctioned countries. Moreover, the Company’s drilling contracts may violate applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations as a result of actions that do not involve the Company or its drilling units, and those violations could in turn negatively affect the Company's reputation. Investor perception of the value of the Company's common units may also be adversely affected by the consequences of war, the effects of terrorism, civil unrest and governmental actions in these and surrounding countries.Local content policies may impair the Company’s ability to compete in local jurisdictions, and changes in these policies may adversely affect the Company's financial conditions and results of operations.Certain foreign governments, such as those of Nigeria and Angola, favor or effectively require (i) the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or to drilling units owned by their own citizens, (ii) the use of a local agent or (iii) foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. For example, the local content policy in Angola requires the Company's customers to develop and implement a plan to increase local Angolan content, including specific goals. In addition, Nigerian laws required one of the Company's subsidiaries to enter into a joint venture with Nigerian investors to own the West Capella. These regulations may adversely affect the Company’s ability to compete in these contract drilling markets. Further, local content policies may be subject to significant and unpredictable changes, which may lead to greater uncertainty in operational planning in those jurisdictions.15Table of ContentsIf the Company's drilling units fail to maintain their class certification or fail any required survey, that drilling unit would be unable to operate, thereby reducing the Company's revenues and profitability.Every offshore drilling unit is a registered marine vessel and must be “classed” by a classification society. The classification society certifies that the drilling unit is “in-class,” signifying that such drilling unit has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the drilling unit’s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned. If any drilling unit does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey or special survey, the drilling unit will be unable to carry on operations and will be unemployable and uninsurable, which could cause the Company to be in violation of certain covenants in the Company's credit facilities. Any such inability to carry on operations or be employed, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and ability to make distributions to the Company's unitholders. Fluctuations in exchange rates or exchange controls could result in losses to us.As a result of the Company’s international operations, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates due to revenues being received and operating expenses paid in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Accordingly, the Company may experience currency exchange losses if the Company has not fully hedged the Company's exposure to a foreign currency, or if revenues are received in currencies that are not readily convertible. The Company may also be unable to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over the repatriation of income or capital or controls over currency exchange.The Company and the majority of its subsidiaries use the U.S. Dollar as their functional currency because the majority of their revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Accordingly, the Company's reporting currency is also U.S. Dollars. The Company does, however, earn revenue and incur expenses in other currencies and there is a risk that currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the Company's statements of operations and cash flows.The Company may be unable to obtain, maintain, and/or renew permits necessary for the Company's operations or experience delays in obtaining such permits, which could have a material effect on the Company's operations.The operation of the Company’s drilling units are subject to certain governmental approvals and permits. The permitting rules in most jurisdictions are complex and subject to change, including their interpretations by regulators, all of which may make compliance more difficult or impractical, and may increase the length of time it takes to receive regulatory approval for offshore drilling operations. In many jurisdictions, substantive requirements under environmental laws are implemented through permits and permit renewals. If the Company fails to timely secure the necessary approvals or permits, the Company’s customers may have the right to terminate or seek to renegotiate their drilling contracts to the Company’s detriment. In the future, the amendment or modification of existing laws and regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations curtailing or further regulating exploratory or development drilling and production of oil and gas or increasing the time needed to obtain necessary environmental permits, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results or financial condition.The Company is subject to complex environmental laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.The Company’s operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations in the form of international conventions and treaties, and national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which its drilling units operate or are registered, which can significantly affect the operation of its drilling units. The offshore drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and, accordingly, the Company is directly affected by the adoption of laws and regulations that, for economic, environmental or other policy reasons, may curtail exploration and development drilling for oil and gas. Compliance with such laws, regulations and standards, where applicable, may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes and may affect the resale value or useful lifetime of the Company’s drilling units. The Company may also incur additional costs in order to comply with other existing and future regulatory obligations, including, but not limited to, costs relating to air emissions, including greenhouse gases, the management of ballast waters, maintenance and inspection, development and implementation of emergency procedures and insurance coverage or other financial assurance of its ability to address pollution incidents. These costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of the Company’s operations. Environmental laws often impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject the Company to liability without regard to whether it was negligent or at fault. Under the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, for example, owners, operators and bareboat charterers are jointly and severally strictly liable for the discharge of oil within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone around the United States. An oil or chemical spill, for which the Company is deemed a responsible party, could result in significant liability, including fines, penalties and criminal liability and remediation costs for natural resource damages under other international and U.S. federal, state and local laws, as well as third-party damages, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, the 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon well and the subsequent release of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or other similar events, may result in further regulation of the shipping industry, and modifications to statutory liability schemes, thus exposing the Company to further potential financial risk in the event of any such oil or chemical spill.16Table of ContentsThe Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses, and certificates with respect to the Company's operations, and satisfy insurance and financial responsibility requirements for potential oil (including marine fuel) spills and other pollution incidents. Although the Company has arranged insurance to cover certain environmental risks, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all such risks or that any claims will not have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and its ability to pay distributions, if any, in the future.Although the Company's drilling units are separately owned by the Company's subsidiaries, under certain circumstances a parent company and all of the unit-owning affiliates in a group under common control engaged in a joint venture could be held liable for damages or debts owed by one of the affiliates, including liabilities for oil spills under OPA or other environmental laws. Therefore, it is possible that the Company could be subject to liability upon a judgment against the Company or any one of the Company's subsidiaries.The Company’s drilling units could cause the release of oil or hazardous substances, especially as its drilling units age. Any releases may be large in quantity, above the Company's permitted limits or occur in protected or sensitive areas where public interest groups or governmental authorities have special interests. Any releases of oil or hazardous substances could result in fines and other costs to the Company, such as costs to upgrade its drilling units, clean up the releases, and comply with more stringent requirements in its discharge permits. Moreover, these releases may result in the Company’s customers or governmental authorities suspending or terminating its operations in the affected area, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operation and financial condition.If the Company is able to obtain from the Company's customers some degree of contractual indemnification against pollution and environmental damages, the indemnification may not be applicable in all instances or the customer may not be financially able to comply with its indemnity obligations. In the future, the Company may not be able to obtain contractual indemnification against pollution and environmental damages.In addition, the Company is required to satisfy insurance and financial responsibility requirements for potential oil (including marine fuel) spills and other pollution incidents. The Company's insurance coverage may not be available in the future, or the Company may not obtain certain insurance coverage. Even if insurance is available and the Company has obtained the coverage, the insurance coverage may not be adequate to satisfy the Company's liabilities or its insurance underwriters may be unable to pay compensation if a significant claim should occur. Any of these scenarios could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.To the extent new laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore drilling or impose additional environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry, in general, or the offshore drilling industry, in particular, the Company's business or prospects could be materially adversely affected. Future earnings and cash available for distribution may be negatively affected by compliance with any such new legislation or regulations.Climate change and regulation of greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on the Company's business.Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries and the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization, or the IMO, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As of January 1, 2013, all ships (including rigs and drillships) must comply with mandatory requirements adopted by the IMO’s Maritime Environment Protection Committee, or MEPC, in July 2011, relating to greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union has indicated that it intends to propose an expansion of the existing European Union emissions trading scheme to include emissions of greenhouse gases from marine vessels.All ships are required to follow the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans, or SEEMP, and minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile, outlined in the Energy Efficiency Design Index, or EEDI, applies to all new ships. These requirements could cause the Company to incur additional compliance costs. The IMO is planning to implement market-based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships at an upcoming MEPC session. In April 2013, the European Union Parliament rejected proposed changes to the European Union Emissions law regarding carbon trading. The measures would have limited the availability of permits that allow companies to emit greenhouse gases. The European Union is still considering an expansion of the existing European Union emissions trading scheme to include emissions of greenhouse gases from marine vessels, including drilling units, and in June 2013, the European Commission issued a memorandum recommending a “gradual approach” starting with a program to monitor, report and verify such greenhouse gas emissions from ships. In the United States, the EPA has issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety and has adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources and large stationary sources. Although the mobile source emissions regulations do not apply to greenhouse gas emissions from drilling units, such regulation of drilling units is foreseeable, and the EPA has in recent years received petitions from the California Attorney General and various environmental groups seeking such regulation. In June 2014, the Supreme Court overturned the EPA “Tailoring Rule,” which required a Title V permit for statutory sources based on potential emissions of greenhouse gases. The Supreme Court also ruled, however, that EPA properly determined that Best Available Control Technology requirements for greenhouse gases would apply to sources that require Title V permits based on potential to emit conventional pollutants.Compliance with changes in laws, regulations and obligations relating to climate change could increase the Company's costs related to operating and maintaining the Company's assets, and might also require the Company to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to the Company's greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. Additionally, adverse effects upon the oil and gas industry relating to climate change, including growing public concern about the environmental impact of climate change, may also adversely affect demand for the Company's services. For example, increased regulation of greenhouse gases or other concerns relating to climate change may reduce the demand for oil and gas in the future or create greater incentives for use of alternative 17Table of Contentsenergy sources. Any long-term material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry could have a significant financial and operational adverse impact on the Company's business, including capital expenditures to upgrade the Company's drilling units, that the Company cannot predict with certainty at this time.The aftermath of the moratorium on offshore drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and new regulations adopted as a result of the investigation into the Macondo well blowout, could negatively impact us.In the near-term aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon Incident, in which the Company was not involved, that led to the Macondo well blow out situation, the U.S. government on May 30, 2010 imposed a six-month moratorium on certain drilling activities in water deeper than 500 feet in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and subsequently implemented Notices to Lessees 2010-N05 and 2010-N06, providing enhanced safety requirements applicable to all drilling activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including drilling activities in water shallower than 500 feet. On October 12, 2010, the U.S. government lifted the moratorium subject to compliance with the requirements set forth in Notices to Lessees 2010-N05 and 2010-N06. Additionally, all drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico must comply with the Interim Final Rule to Enhance Safety Measures for Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf (Drilling Safety Rule) and the Workplace Safety Rule on Safety and Environmental Management Systems and various requirements imposed through Notices to Lessees and Operators (SEMS). Operators were required to implement a SEMS program by November 15, 2011 and submit their first completed SEMS audit to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, or BSEE, by November 15, 2013. The original SEMS rule was later modified by the SEMS II final rule which became effective June 4, 2013. SEMS II enhanced and supplemented operators' SEMS programs with employee training, empowering field level personnel with safety management decisions and strengthening auditing procedures by requiring them to be completed by independent third parties. Operators had until June 4, 2014 to comply with SEMS II, except for certain auditing requirements. All SEMS audits must comply with SEMS II by June 4, 2015. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) imposes additional recordkeeping obligations concerning occupational injuries and illnesses for MODUs attached to the outer continental shelf.In addition, in order to obtain drilling permits, operators must submit applications that demonstrate compliance with the enhanced regulations, which require independent third-party inspections, certification of well design and well control equipment and emergency response plans in the event of a blowout, among other requirements. Operators have previously had, and may in the future have, difficulties obtaining drilling permits in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the oil and gas industry has adopted new equipment and operating standards, such as the American Petroleum Institute Standard 53 relating to the installation and testing of well control equipment. Likewise, in August 2014, BSEE proposed an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing variations to the permitting program that would bolster the offshore financial assurance and bonding program. These new and proposed guidelines and standards for safety, environmental and financial assurance and any other new guidelines or standards the U.S. government or industry may issue or any other steps the U.S. government or industry may take, could disrupt or delay operations, increase the cost of operations, increase out-of-service time or reduce the area of operations for drilling rigs in U.S. and non-U.S. offshore areas.The Company continues to evaluate these new measures to ensure that its drilling units and equipment are in full compliance, where applicable. As new standards and procedures are being integrated into the existing framework of offshore regulatory programs, the Company anticipates that there may be increased costs associated with regulatory compliance and delays in obtaining permits for other operations such as recompletions, workovers and abandonment activities.Additional requirements could be forthcoming based on further recommendations by regulatory agencies investigating the Macondo incident. The Company is not able to predict the likelihood, nature or extent of additional rulemaking or when the interim rules, or any future rules, could become final. The current and future regulatory environment in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could impact the demand for drilling units in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in terms of overall number of rigs in operation and the technical specification required for offshore rigs to operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. It is possible that short-term potential migration of rigs from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could adversely impact dayrates levels and fleet utilization in other regions. Additional governmental regulations concerning licensing, taxation, equipment specifications, training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of the Company’s operations, and escalating costs borne by its customers, along with permitting delays, could reduce exploration and development activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and, therefore, reduce demand for the Company’s services. In addition, insurance costs across the industry have increased as a result of the Macondo incident and, in the future, certain insurance coverage is likely to become more costly, and may become less available or not available at all. The Company cannot predict if the U.S. government will issue new drilling permits in a timely manner, nor can the Company predict the potential impact of new regulations that may be forthcoming as the investigation into the Macondo well incident continues. Nor can the Company predict if implementation of additional regulations might subject the Company to increased costs of operating and/or a reduction in the area of operation in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. As such, the Company's cash available for distribution and financial position could be adversely affected if the Company's drilling unit operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico became subject to the risks mentioned above.18Table of ContentsThe Company's ability to operate its drilling units in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could be restricted by governmental regulationHurricanes have from time to time caused damage to a number of unaffiliated drilling units in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or BOEMRE, formerly the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior, effective October 1, 2011, reorganized into two new organizations, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, and BSEE, and issued guidelines for tie-downs on drilling units and permanent equipment and facilities attached to outer continental shelf production platforms, and moored drilling unit fitness. BSEE subsequently issued additional guidelines requiring Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODUs) to be outfitted with Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and to provide BSEE with real-time GPS location data for MODUs effective March 19, 2013. These guidelines effectively impose new requirements on the offshore oil and gas industry in an attempt to increase the likelihood of survival of offshore drilling units during a hurricane. The guidelines also provide for enhanced information and data requirements from oil and gas companies that operate properties in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico region of the Outer Continental Shelf. BOEM and BSEE may issue similar guidelines for future hurricane seasons and may take other steps that could increase the cost of operations or reduce the area of operations for the Company’s ultra-deepwater drilling units, thereby reducing their marketability. Implementation of new guidelines or regulations that may apply to ultra-deepwater drilling units may subject the Company to increased costs and limit the operational capabilities of its drilling units, although such risks to the extent possible should rest with the Company’s customers.The Company cannot guarantee that the use of the Company’s drilling units will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others.The majority of the intellectual property rights relating to the Company’s drilling units and related equipment are owned by its suppliers. In the event that one of the Company’s suppliers becomes involved in a dispute over infringement of intellectual property rights relating to equipment owned by the Company, it may lose access to repair services, replacement parts, or could be required to cease use of some equipment. In addition, the Company’s competitors may assert claims for infringement of intellectual property rights related to certain equipment on its drilling units and the Company may be required to stop using such equipment and/or pay damages and royalties for the use of such equipment. The consequences of technology disputes involving the Company’s suppliers or competitors could adversely affect its financial results, operations and cash available for distribution. The Company has provisions in some of its supply contracts which provide indemnity from the supplier against intellectual property lawsuits. However, the Company cannot be assured that these suppliers will be willing or financially able to honor their indemnity obligations, or guarantee that the indemnities will fully protect the Company from the adverse consequences of such technology disputes. The Company also has provisions in some of its customer contracts to require the customer to share some of these risks on a limited basis, but the Company cannot provide assurance that these provisions will fully protect the Company from the adverse consequences of such technology disputes.Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the UK Bribery Act could result in fines, criminal penalties, drilling contract terminations and an adverse effect on the Company's business.The Company currently operates its drilling units in a number of countries throughout the world, including some with developing economies. Also, the Company's business with national oil companies and state or government-owned shipbuilding enterprises and financing agencies puts the Company in contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” or “foreign public officials” under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA, and the Bribery Act 2010 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, or the UK Bribery Act, respectively. The Company is subject to the risk that the Company, the Company's affiliated entities or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents may take actions determined to be in violation of such anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, curtailment of the Company’s operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage the Company's reputation and ability to do business. Furthermore, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations would be expensive and consume significant time and attention of the Company's senior management.In order to effectively compete in some foreign jurisdictions, the Company utilizes local agents and/or establishes joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners. For example, in Nigeria, Nigerian investors have invested in a subsidiary of Seadrill Operating LP that is fully controlled and approximately 56% owned by Seadrill Operating LP, and has resulted in a Nigerian joint venture partner owning an effective 1% interest in the West Capella. Seadrill owns the remaining ownership interest in the joint venture. All of these activities involve interaction by the Company's agents with non-U.S. government officials. Even though some of the Company's agents and partners may not themselves be subject to the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act or other anti-bribery laws to which the Company may be subject, if the Company's agents or partners make improper payments to non-U.S. government officials in connection with engagements or partnerships with the Company, the Company could be investigated and potentially found liable for violation of such anti-bribery laws and could incur civil and criminal penalties and other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Acts of terrorism, piracy and political and social unrest could affect the Company specifically or, more generally, the markets for drilling services, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.Acts of terrorism, piracy, and political and social unrest, brought about by world political events or otherwise, have caused instability in the world’s financial and insurance markets in the past and may occur in the future. Such acts could be directed against companies such as ours. the Company’s drilling operations may be targeted by acts of terrorism, piracy, or acts of vandalism or sabotage carried out by environmental activist groups. In addition, acts of terrorism and political and social unrest could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and gas and could affect the markets for drilling services and result in lower dayrates. The Company’s insurance premiums could increase as a result of these events, and coverage may be unavailable in the future.19Table of ContentsAny failure to comply with the complex laws and regulations governing international trade could adversely affect the Company's operations.The shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects the Company's business to extensive trade laws and regulations. Import activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries of operation. Moreover, many countries, including the United States, control the export and re-export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related export record keeping and reporting obligations. Governments also may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities. U.S. sanctions, in particular, are targeted against countries (such as Russia, Venezuela, Iran, Myanmar and Sudan, among others) that are heavily involved in the petroleum and petrochemical industries, which includes drilling activities.The laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting the Company's operations. Shipments can be delayed and denied export or entry for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside the Company's control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes. Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could also result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from government contracts, and seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges.Public health threats could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations and the Company's financial results.Public health threats, such as ebola, influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which the Company operates, could adversely impact the Company's operations, and the operations of the Company's customers. In addition, public health threats in any area, including areas where the Company does not operate, could disrupt international transportation. The Company's crews generally work on a rotation basis, with a substantial portion relying on international air transport for rotation. Any such disruptions could impact the cost of rotating the Company's crews, and possibly impact the Company's ability to maintain a full crew on all rigs. Any of these public health threats and related consequences could adversely affect the Company's financial results.A cyber-attack could materially disrupt the Company's businessThe Company relies on information technology systems and networks, the majority of which are provided by Seadrill, in its operations and administration of its business. The Company's drilling operations or other business operations, or those of Seadrill, could be targeted by individuals or groups seeking to sabotage or disrupt the Company's or Seadrill's information technology systems and networks, or to steal data. A successful cyber-attack could materially disrupt the Company's operations, including the safety of its operations, or lead to unauthorized release of information or alteration of information on its systems. Any such attack or other breach of the Company's information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.We may be subject to litigation, arbitration and other proceedings that could have an adverse effect on us.The Company is currently involved in various litigation matters, none of which are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition. The Company anticipates that it will be involved in litigation matters from time to time in the future. The operating hazards inherent in the Company's business expose it to litigation, including personal injury litigation, environmental litigation, contractual litigation with clients, intellectual property litigation, tax or securities litigation, and maritime lawsuits, including the possible arrest of the Company's drilling units. The Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter, or a combination of these. If the Company is involved in any future litigation, or if the Company's positions concerning current disputes are found to be incorrect, this may have an adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations and available cash, because of potential negative outcomes, the costs associated with asserting the Company's claims or defending such lawsuits, and the diversion of management’s attention to these matters.Risks Inherent in an Investment in UsSeadrill and its affiliates may compete with us.Pursuant to the Company's omnibus agreement, Seadrill and its controlled affiliates generally have agreed not to acquire, own, operate or contract for certain drilling units operating under drilling contracts of five or more years, unless Seadrill offers to sell such drilling units to us. The omnibus agreement, however, contains significant exceptions that may allow Seadrill or any of its controlled affiliates to compete with the Company, which could harm the Company's business. Please read Item 7 “Major Unitholders and Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions—Agreements Governing the Transactions—Omnibus Agreement—Noncompetition.”Unitholders have limited voting rights, and the Company's operating agreement restricts the voting rights of the unitholders owning more than 5% of the Company's common units.Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, holders of common units have only limited voting rights on matters affecting the Company's business. The Company will hold a meeting of the members every year to elect one or more members of the Company's board of directors and to vote on any other matters that are properly brought before the meeting. Common unitholders are entitled to elect only four of the seven members of the Company's board of directors. The elected directors are elected on a staggered basis and will serve for three year terms. The Seadrill Member in its sole discretion appoints the remaining three directors and sets the terms for which those directors will serve. The operating 20Table of Contentsagreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about the Company's operations, as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders’ ability to influence the manner or direction of management. Unitholders have no right to elect the Seadrill Member, and the Seadrill Member may not be removed except by a vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding common and subordinated units, including any units owned by the Seadrill Member and its affiliates, voting together as a single class.The Company's operating agreement further restricts unitholders’ voting rights by providing that if any person or group owns beneficially more than 5% of any class of units then outstanding, any such units owned by that person or group in excess of 5% may not be voted on any matter and will not be considered to be outstanding when sending notices of a meeting of unitholders, calculating required votes (except for purposes of nominating a person for election to the Company's board), determining the presence of a quorum or for other similar purposes, unless required by law. The voting rights of any such unitholders in excess of 5% will effectively be redistributed pro rata among the other common unitholders holding less than 5% of the voting power of all classes of units entitled to vote. The Seadrill Member, its affiliates and persons who acquired common units with the prior approval of the Company's board of directors are not be subject to this 5% limitation except with respect to voting their common units in the election of the elected directors.The Seadrill Member and its other affiliates own a substantial interest in the Company and have conflicts of interest and limited duties to the Company and the Company's common unitholders, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of the Company's unitholders.As of March 31, 2015, Seadrill owned a 46.6% limited liability company interest in the Company, and owned and controlled the Seadrill Member. Certain of the Company's officers and directors are directors and/or officers of Seadrill and its subsidiaries and, as such, they have fiduciary duties to Seadrill that may cause them to pursue business strategies that disproportionately benefit Seadrill or which otherwise are not in the best interests of the Company or the Company's unitholders. Conflicts of interest may arise between Seadrill and its subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Company and the Company's unitholders, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, Seadrill and its subsidiaries may favor their own interests over the interests of the Company's unitholders. Please read “—The Company's operating agreement limits the duties the Seadrill Member and the Company's directors and officers may have to the Company's unitholders and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by the Seadrill Member or the Company's directors and officers.” These conflicts include, among others, the following situations:•neither the Company's operating agreement nor any other agreement requires the Seadrill Member or Seadrill or its affiliates to pursue a business strategy that favors the Company or utilizes the Company's assets, and Seadrill’s officers and directors have a fiduciary duty to make decisions in the best interests of the shareholders of Seadrill, which may be contrary to the Company's interests;•the Company's operating agreement provides that the Seadrill Member may make determinations to take or decline to take actions without regard to the Company's or the Company's unitholders’ interests. Specifically, the Seadrill Member may exercise its call right, pre-emptive rights, registration rights or right to make a determination to receive common units in exchange for resetting the target distribution levels related to the incentive distribution rights, consent or withhold consent to any merger or consolidation of the company, appoint any directors or vote for the election of any director, vote or refrain from voting on amendments to the Company's operating agreement that require a vote of the outstanding units, voluntarily withdraw from the company, transfer (to the extent permitted under the Company's operating agreement) or refrain from transferring its units, the Seadrill Member interest or incentive distribution rights or vote upon the dissolution of the company;•the Seadrill Member and the Company's directors and officers have limited their liabilities and any fiduciary duties they may have under the laws of the Marshall Islands, while also restricting the remedies available to the Company's unitholders, and, as a result of purchasing common units, unitholders are treated as having agreed to the modified standard of fiduciary duties and to certain actions that may be taken by the Seadrill Member and the Company's directors and officers, all as set forth in the operating agreement;•the Seadrill Member is entitled to reimbursement of all costs incurred by it and its affiliates for the Company's benefit;•the Company's operating agreement does not restrict the Company from paying the Seadrill Member or its affiliates for any services rendered to the Company on terms that are fair and reasonable or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on the Company's behalf;•the Seadrill Member may exercise its right to call and purchase the Company's common units if it and its affiliates own more than 80% of the Company's common units; and•the Seadrill Member is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon the exercise of its limited call right.Although a majority of the Company's directors are elected by common unitholders, the Seadrill Member will likely have substantial influence on decisions made by the Company's board of directors. Please read Item 7 “Major Unitholders and Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions”Although the Company controls OPCO, the Company owes duties to OPCO and its other owner, Seadrill, which may conflict with the interests of the Company and the Company's unitholders.Conflicts of interest may arise as a result of the relationships between the Company and the Company's unitholders, on the one hand, and OPCO, and its other owner, Seadrill, on the other hand. Seadrill owns a 42% limited partner interest in Seadrill Operating LP, a 49% limited liability company interest in Seadrill Capricorn Holdings LLC and a 100% limited liability company interest in the Seadrill Member. The Company's directors have duties to manage OPCO in a manner beneficial to us. At the same time, the Company's directors have a duty to manage OPCO in a manner beneficial to OPCO’s owners, including Seadrill. The Company's board of directors may resolve any such conflict and has broad 21Table of Contentslatitude to consider the interests of all parties to the conflict. The resolution of these conflicts may not always be in the best interest of the Company or the Company's unitholders.For example, conflicts of interest may arise in the following situations:•the allocation of shared overhead expenses to OPCO and us;•the interpretation and enforcement of contractual obligations between the Company and the Company's affiliates, on the one hand, and OPCO or its subsidiaries, on the other hand;•the determination and timing of the amount of cash to be distributed to OPCO’s owners and the amount of cash to be reserved for the future conduct of OPCO’s business;•the decision as to whether OPCO should make asset or business acquisitions or dispositions, and on what terms;•the determination of the amount and timing of OPCO’s capital expenditures;•the determination of whether OPCO should use cash on hand, borrow or issue equity to raise cash to finance maintenance or expansion capital projects, repay indebtedness, meet working capital needs or otherwise; and•any decision the Company makes to engage in business activities independent of, or in competition with, OPCO.Certain of the Company's officers face conflicts in the allocation of their time to the Company's business.Certain of the Company's officers are not required to work full-time on the Company's affairs and also perform services for other companies, including Seadrill. For example, Rune Magnus Lundetræ, who is the Company's Chief Financial Officer, also provides services in a similar capacity for Seadrill. In addition, Graham Robjohns, who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer, also acts as the Chief Executive Officer of Golar LNG Partners LP. These other companies conduct substantial businesses and activities of their own in which the Company has no economic interest. As a result, there could be material competition for the time and effort of the Company's officers who also provide services to other companies, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Please read Item 6 “Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Directors and Senior Management—Executive Officers—Allocation of Executive Officers’ Time.”The Company's operating agreement limits the duties the Seadrill Member and the Company's directors and officers may have to the Company's unitholders and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by the Seadrill Member or the Company's directors and officers.The Company's operating agreement provides that the Company's board of directors has the authority to oversee and direct the Company's operations, management and policies on an exclusive basis. The Marshall Islands Limited Liability Company Act of 1996, or the Marshall Islands Act, states that a member or manager’s “duties and liabilities may be expanded or restricted by provisions in a limited liability company agreement.” As permitted by the Marshall Islands Act, the Company's operating agreement contains provisions that reduce the standards to which the Seadrill Member and the Company's directors and the Company's officers may otherwise be held by Marshall Islands law. For example, the Company's operating agreement:•provides that the Seadrill Member may make determinations or take or decline to take actions without regard to the Company's or the Company's unitholders’ interests. The Seadrill Member may consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting the Company, the Company's affiliates or the Company's unitholders. Decisions made by the Seadrill Member are made by its sole owner, Seadrill. Specifically, the Seadrill Member may decide to exercise its right to make a determination to receive common units in exchange for resetting the target distribution levels related to the incentive distribution rights, call right, pre-emptive rights or registration rights, consent or withhold consent to any merger or consolidation of the company, appoint any directors or vote for the election of any director, vote or refrain from voting on amendments to the Company's operating agreement that require a vote of the outstanding units, voluntarily withdraw from the company, transfer (to the extent permitted under the Company's operating agreement) or refrain from transferring its units, the Seadrill Member interest or incentive distribution rights or vote upon the dissolution of the company;•provides that the Company's directors and officers are entitled to make other decisions in “good faith,” meaning they believe that the decision is in the Company's best interests;•generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the conflicts committee of the Company's board of directors and not involving a vote of unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to the Company than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or be “fair and reasonable” to the Company and that, in determining whether a transaction or resolution is “fair and reasonable,” the Company's board of directors may consider the totality of the relationships between the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us; and•provides that neither the Seadrill Member nor the Company's officers or the Company's directors will be liable for monetary damages to the Company, the Company's members or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the Seadrill Member, the Company's directors or officers or those other persons engaged in actual fraud or willful misconduct.The standard of care applicable to an officer or director of Seadrill when that individual is acting in such capacity is, in a number of circumstances, stricter than the standard of care the same individual may have when acting as an officer or director of us. The fact that an officer or director of the Company may have a fiduciary duty to Seadrill does not, however, diminish the duty that such individual owes to us. Compliance by such 22Table of Contentsofficer or director of the Company with such individual’s duty to the Company should not result in a violation of such individual’s duties to Seadrill.In order to become a member of the Company, a common unitholder is required to agree to be bound by the provisions in the operating agreement, including the provisions discussed above.Fees and cost reimbursements, which Seadrill Management and certain other subsidiaries of Seadrill determine for services provided to the Company, OPCO, and its subsidiaries, will be substantial, will be payable regardless of the Company's profitability and will reduce the Company's cash available for distribution to the Company's unitholders.Pursuant to the advisory, technical and administrative service agreements, OPCO pays fees for services provided to OPCO and its subsidiaries by certain subsidiaries of Seadrill, and the Company and its subsidiaries reimburse these entities for all expenses they incur on their behalf. These fees and expenses include all costs and expenses incurred in providing certain advisory, technical and administrative services to the OPCO’s subsidiaries.In addition, pursuant to the management and administrative services agreements Seadrill Management provides the Company with significant management, administrative, financial and other support services and/or personnel. The Company reimburses Seadrill Management for the reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of these services. In addition, the Company pays Seadrill Management a management fee.There is no cap on the amount of fees and cost reimbursements that OPCO and its subsidiaries may be required to pay such subsidiaries of Seadrill pursuant to the advisory, technical and administrative service agreements, or that the Company may be required to pay under the management and administrative services agreements. For a description of the advisory, technical and administrative service agreements and the management and administrative services agreements, please read Item 7 “Major Unitholder and Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions.” The fees and expenses payable pursuant to the advisory, technical and administrative service agreements and the management and administrative services agreements will be payable without regard to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. The payment of fees to and the reimbursement of expenses of Seadrill Management, and certain other subsidiaries of Seadrill could adversely affect the Company's ability to pay cash distributions the Company's unitholders.The Company's operating agreement contains provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a person or group from attempting to remove the Company's current management or the Seadrill Member, and even if public unitholders are dissatisfied, they will be unable to remove the Seadrill Member without Seadrill’s consent, unless Seadrill’s ownership interest in the Company is decreased; all of which could diminish the trading price of the Company's common units.The Company's operating agreement contains provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a person or group from attempting to remove the Company's current management or the Seadrill Member.•The unitholders are unable to remove the Seadrill Member without its consent because the Seadrill Member and its affiliates own sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of all outstanding common and subordinated units voting together as a single class is required to remove the Seadrill Member. As of March 31, 2015, Seadrill owned 46.6% of the outstanding common and subordinated units.•If the Seadrill Member is removed without “cause” during the subordination period and units held by the Seadrill Member and Seadrill are not voted in favor of that removal, all remaining subordinated units will automatically convert into common units, any existing arrearages on the common units will be extinguished, and the Seadrill Member will have the right to convert its incentive distribution rights into common units or to receive cash in exchange for those interests based on the fair market value of those interests at the time. A removal of the Seadrill Member under these circumstances would adversely affect the common units by prematurely eliminating their distribution and liquidation preference over the subordinated units, which would otherwise have continued until the Company has met certain distribution and performance tests. Any conversion of the Seadrill Member interest or incentive distribution rights would be dilutive to existing unitholders. Furthermore, any cash payment in lieu of such conversion could be prohibitively expensive. “Cause” is narrowly defined to mean that with respect to a director or officer, a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final, non-appealable judgment finding such director or officer liable for actual fraud or willful misconduct, and with respect to the Seadrill Member, the Seadrill Member is in breach of the operating agreement or a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final, non-appealable judgment finding the Seadrill Member liable for actual fraud or willful misconduct against the Company or its members, in their capacity as such. Cause does not include most cases of charges of poor business decisions, such as charges of poor management of the Company's business by the directors appointed by the Seadrill Member, so the removal of the Seadrill Member because of the unitholders’ dissatisfaction with the Seadrill Member’s decisions in this regard would most likely result in the termination of the subordination period.•Common unitholders are entitled to elect only four of the seven members of the Company's board of directors. The Seadrill Member in its sole discretion appoints the remaining three directors.•Election of the four directors elected by unitholders is staggered, meaning that the members of only one of three classes of the Company's elected directors are selected each year. In addition, the directors appointed by the Seadrill Member serve for terms determined by the Seadrill Member.•The Company's operating agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings of unitholders, to nominate directors and to acquire information about the Company's operations as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders’ ability to influence the manner or direction of management.23Table of Contents•Unitholders’ voting rights are further restricted by the operating agreement provision providing that if any person or group owns beneficially more than 5% of any class of units then outstanding, any such units owned by that person or group in excess of 5% may not be voted on any matter and will not be considered to be outstanding when sending notices of a meeting of unitholders, calculating required votes (except for purposes of nominating a person for election to the Company's board), determining the presence of a quorum or for other similar purposes, unless required by law. The voting rights of any such unitholders in excess of 5% will effectively be redistributed pro rata among the other common unitholders holding less than 5% of the voting power of all classes of units entitled to vote. The Seadrill Member, its affiliates and persons who acquired common units with the prior approval of the Company's board of directors are not subject to this 5% limitation except with respect to voting their common units in the election of the elected directors.•There are no restrictions in the Company's operating agreement on the Company's ability to issue additional equity securities.The effect of these provisions may be to diminish the price at which the common units trade.The control of the Seadrill Member may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.The Seadrill Member may transfer its Seadrill Member interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders. In addition, the Company's operating agreement does not restrict the ability of the members of the Seadrill Member from transferring their respective limited liability company interests in the Seadrill Member to a third party.If the Company ceases to control OPCO, the Company may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.If the Company ceases to manage and control OPCO and are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 because of the Company's ownership of OPCO interests, the Company would either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC or modify the Company's organizational structure or the Company's contract rights to fall outside the definition of an investment company. Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit the Company's ability to engage in transactions with affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from the Company's affiliates, restrict the Company's ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage, and require the Company to add additional directors who are independent of the Company or the Company's affiliates.Substantial future sales of the Company's common units in the public market could cause the price of the Company's common units to fall.The Company has granted registration rights to Seadrill and certain of its affiliates. These unitholders have the right, subject to some conditions, to require the Company to file registration statements covering any of the Company's common, subordinated or other equity securities owned by them or to include those securities in registration statements that the Company may file for the Company or other unitholders. As of March 31, 2015, Seadrill owned 26,275,750 common units and 16,543,350 subordinated units and all of the incentive distribution rights (through its ownership of the Seadrill Member). Following their registration and sale under an applicable registration statement, those securities will become freely tradable. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of common units or other securities, these unitholders could cause the price of the Company's common units to decline.The Seadrill Member, as the initial holder of all of the incentive distribution rights, may elect to cause the Company to issue additional common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to the Seadrill Member’s incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of the Company's board of directors or holders of the Company's common units and subordinated units. This may result in lower distributions to holders of the Company's common units in certain situations.The Seadrill Member, as the initial holder of all of the incentive distribution rights, has the right, at a time when there are no subordinated units outstanding and the Seadrill Member has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled (50%) for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters, to reset the initial cash target distribution levels at higher levels based on the distribution at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election by the Seadrill Member, the minimum quarterly distribution amount will be reset to an amount equal to the average cash distribution amount per common unit for the two fiscal quarters immediately preceding the reset election (such amount is referred to as the “reset minimum quarterly distribution”), and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on the same percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution amount.In connection with resetting these target distribution levels, the Seadrill Member will be entitled to receive a number of common units equal to that number of common units whose aggregate quarterly cash distributions equaled the average of the distributions to the Seadrill Member on the incentive distribution rights in the prior two quarters. The Company anticipates that the Seadrill Member would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such conversion; however, it is possible that the Seadrill Member could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing, or may be expected to experience, declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its incentive distribution rights and may therefore desire to be issued the Company's common units, rather than retain the right to receive incentive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels. As a result, a reset election may cause the Company's common unitholders to experience dilution in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had the Company not issued additional common units to the Seadrill Member in connection with resetting the target distribution levels related to the Seadrill Member’s incentive distribution rights.24Table of ContentsThe Company may issue additional equity securities, including securities senior to the common units, without the approval of the Company's unitholders, which would dilute the ownership interests of the Company's existing unitholders.The Company may, without the approval of the Company's unitholders, issue an unlimited number of additional units or other equity securities. In addition, the Company may issue an unlimited number of units that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation and voting. The issuance by the Company of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:•the Company's unitholders’ proportionate ownership interest in the Company will decrease;•the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;•because a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units, the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by the Company's common unitholders will increase;•the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and•the market price of the common units may decline.Upon the expiration of the subordination period, the subordinated units will convert into common units and will then participate pro rata with other common units in distributions of available cash.During the subordination period, the common units will have the right to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.3875 per unit, plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters, before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units. Distribution arrearages do not accrue on the subordinated units. The purpose of the subordinated units is to increase the likelihood that during the subordination period there will be available cash from operating surplus to be distributed on the common units. Upon the expiration of the subordination period, the subordinated units will convert into common units and will then participate pro rata with other common units in distributions of available cash. The subordination period is not due to end until September 30, 2017 but may last longer until various other conditions are met. In establishing cash reserves, the Company's board of directors may reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to the Company's unitholders.The OPCO’s operating agreements provide that the Company's board of directors approves the amount of reserves from the OPCO’s cash flow that will be retained by OPCO to fund its future operating and capital expenditures. The Company's operating agreement requires the Company's board of directors to deduct from operating surplus cash reserves that it determines are necessary to fund the Company's future operating and capital expenditures. These reserves also affect the amount of cash available for distribution by OPCO to the Company, and by the Company to the Company's unitholders. In addition, the Company's board of directors may establish reserves for distributions on the subordinated units, but only if those reserves do not prevent the Company from distributing the full minimum quarterly distribution, plus any arrearages, on the common units for the following four quarters. As described above in “—Risks Inherent in The Company's Business— the Company must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of its fleet, which will reduce cash available for distribution. In addition, each quarter the Company is required to deduct estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures from operating surplus, which may result in less cash available to unitholders than if actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures were deducted,” the Company's operating agreement requires the Company's board of directors each quarter to deduct from operating surplus estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, as opposed to actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, which could reduce the amount of available cash for distribution. The amount of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures deducted from operating surplus is subject to review and change by the Company's board of directors at least once a year, provided that any change must be approved by the conflicts committee of the Company's board of directors.The Seadrill Member has a limited call right that may require the Company's common unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.If at any time the Seadrill Member and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units, the Seadrill Member will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to the Company, but not the obligation, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than the then-current market price of the Company's common units. The Seadrill Member is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon the exercise of this limited call right. As a result, the holders of the Company's common units may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on their investment. Such common unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their common units.As of March 31, 2015, Seadrill, which owns and controls the Seadrill Member, owned 34.9% of the Company's common units. At the end of the subordination period, assuming no additional issuances of common units and the conversion of the Company's subordinated units into common units, Seadrill would own 46.6% of the Company's common units. The Company can borrow money to pay distributions, which would reduce the amount of credit available to operate the Company's business.The Company's operating agreement allows the Company to make working capital borrowings to pay distributions. Accordingly, if the Company has available borrowing capacity, the Company can make distributions on all the Company's units even though cash generated by the Company's operations may not be sufficient to pay such distributions. Any working capital borrowings by the Company to make distributions will reduce the amount of working capital borrowings the Company can make for operating the Company's business. For more information, please read Item 5 “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”25Table of ContentsIncreases in interest rates may cause the market price of the Company's common units to decline.An increase in interest rates may cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments in general, and in particular for yield-based equity investments such as the Company's common units. Any such increase in interest rates or reduction in demand for the Company's common units resulting from other relatively more attractive investment opportunities may cause the trading price of the Company's common units to decline.Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions.Under some circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under the Marshall Islands Act, the Company may not make a distribution to the Company's unitholders if the distribution would cause the Company's liabilities to exceed the fair value of the Company's assets. The Marshall Islands Act provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, members who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated the Marshall Islands Act will be liable to the limited liability company for the distribution amount. Assignees who become substituted members are liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the company that are known to the assignee at the time it became members and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from the operating agreement. Liabilities to members on account of their limited liability company interest and liabilities that are non-recourse to the company is not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.The Company has been organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of limited liability company law.The Company's limited liability company affairs are governed by the Company's operating agreement and by the Marshall Islands Act. The provisions of the Marshall Islands Act resemble provisions of the limited liability company laws of a number of states in the United States, most notably Delaware. The Marshall Islands Act also provides that it is to be applied and construed to make it uniform with the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and, so long as it does not conflict with the Marshall Islands Act or decisions of the Marshall Islands courts, interpreted according to the non-statutory law (or case law) of the State of Delaware. There have been, however, few, if any, court cases in the Marshall Islands interpreting the Marshall Islands Act, in contrast to Delaware, which has a fairly well-developed body of case law interpreting its limited liability company statute. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict whether Marshall Islands courts would reach the same conclusions as the courts in Delaware. For example, the rights of the Company's unitholders and the duties of the Seadrill Member and the Company's directors and officers under Marshall Islands law are not as clearly established as under judicial precedent in existence in Delaware. As a result, unitholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions by the Seadrill Member and the Company's officers and directors than would unitholders of a similarly organized limited liability company in the United States.Because the Company is organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands, it may be difficult to serve the Company with legal process or enforce judgments against the Company, the Company's directors or the Company's management.The Company is organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands, and substantially all of the Company's assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, the Seadrill Member is a Marshall Islands limited liability company, and the Company's directors and officers generally are or will be non-residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of these non-residents are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against the Company or against these individuals in the United States if you believe that your rights have been infringed under securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Marshall Islands and of other jurisdictions may prevent or restrict you from enforcing a judgment against the Company's assets or the assets of the Seadrill Member or the Company's directors or officers.Tax RisksIn addition to the following risk factors, you should read Item 4 “Information on the Company—Business Overview—Taxation of the Company,” and Item 10 “Additional Information—Taxation” for a more complete discussion of the expected material U.S. federal and non-U.S. income tax considerations relating to the Company and the ownership and disposition of the Company's common units.The Company will be subject to taxes, which will reduce the Company's cash available for distribution to the Company's unitholders.Some of the Company's subsidiaries will be subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or operate, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution. In computing the Company's tax obligation in these jurisdictions, the Company is required to take various tax accounting and reporting positions on matters that are not entirely free from doubt and for which the Company has not received rulings from the governing authorities. The Company cannot assure you that upon review of these positions the applicable authorities will agree with the Company's positions. A successful challenge by a tax authority could result in additional tax imposed on the Company's subsidiaries, further reducing the cash available for distribution. In addition, changes in the Company's operations could result in additional tax being imposed on the Company or its subsidiaries in jurisdictions in which operations are conducted. Please read Item 4 “Information on the Company—Business Overview—Taxation of the Company.”26Table of ContentsA change in tax laws in any country in which the Company operates could result in higher tax expense.The Company conducts its operations through various subsidiaries. Tax laws and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Consequently, the Company is subject to changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between countries in which the Company operates. The Company's income tax expense is based on the Company's interpretation of the tax laws in effect at the time the expense was incurred. A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a materially higher tax expense or a higher effective tax rate on the Company's earnings.The Company files periodic tax returns that are subject to review and audit by various revenue agencies in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Taxing authorities may challenge any of the Company's tax positions, at which time the Company will contest such assessments where the Company believes the assessments are in error. Determinations by such authorities that differ materially from the Company's recorded estimates, favorably or unfavorably, may have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash available for distribution.A loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax challenge to the Company's operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of the Company's subsidiaries in certain countries could result in a higher tax rate on the Company's worldwide earnings, which could result in a significant negative impact on the Company's earnings and cash flows from operations.The Company's income tax returns are subject to review and examination. The Company does not recognize the benefit of income tax positions the Company believes are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority. If any tax authority successfully challenges the Company's operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of the Company's subsidiaries in certain countries; or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to the Company's structure; or if the Company loses a material tax dispute in any country, the Company's effective tax rate on the Company's worldwide earnings could increase substantially and the Company's earnings and cash flows from operations could be materially adversely affected.U.S. tax authorities could treat the Company as a “passive foreign investment company,” which would have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. unitholders.A non-U.S. entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be treated as a “passive foreign investment company,” or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes if at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year consists of “passive income” or at least 50% of the average value of its assets for any taxable year produce, or are held for the production of, “passive income.” For purposes of these tests, “passive income” includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment property, and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties that are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the performance of services does not constitute “passive income.” U.S. unitholders of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U.S. federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions they receive from the PFIC, and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their interests in the PFIC.Based on the Company's current and projected method of operation, the Company believes that it was not a PFIC for the Company's 2014 taxable year, and the Company expects that the Company will not be treated as a PFIC for the current or any future taxable year. The Company expects that more than 25% of the Company's gross income for the Company's 2014 taxable year arose and for the current and each future year will arise from such drilling contracts or other income that the Company believes should not constitute passive income, and more than 50% of the average value of the Company's assets for each such year will be held for the production of such nonpassive income. Assuming the composition of the Company's income and assets is consistent with these expectations, the Company believes that the Company should not be a PFIC for the Company's 2014 taxable year or the Company's current or any future year.The conclusions that the Company has reached are not free from doubt and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or a court could disagree with the Company's position. In addition, although the Company intends to conduct the Company's affairs in a manner to avoid, to the extent possible, being classified as a PFIC with respect to any taxable year, the Company cannot assure you that the nature of the Company's operations will not change in the future or that the Company will not be a PFIC in the future. If the IRS were to find that the Company is or has been a PFIC for any taxable year (and regardless of whether the Company remains a PFIC for any subsequent taxable year), the Company's U.S. unitholders would face adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.
