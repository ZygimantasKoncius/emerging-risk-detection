ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risk factors that may affect the Companys performance and results of operations include the following: (i) the Companys business is dependent upon general economic conditions in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York. The national and local economies may adversely affect the Companys performance and results of operations; (ii) the Companys earnings depend, to a great extent, upon the level of net interest income generated by the Company, and therefore the Companys results of operations may be adversely affected by increases or decreases in interest rates or by the shape of the yield curve; (iii) the banking business is highly competitive and the profitability of the Company depends upon the Companys ability to attract loans and deposits in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York, where the Company competes with a variety of traditional banking companies, some of which have vastly greater resources, and nontraditional institutions such as credit unions and finance companies; (iv) at December 31, 2015, approximately 67.8% of the Companys loan portfolio was comprised of commercial and commercial real estate loans, exposing the Company to the risks inherent in financings based upon analyses of credit risk, the value of underlying collateral, including real estate, and other more intangible factors, which are considered in making commercial loans; (v) at December 31, 2015, approximately 25.0% of the Companys loan portfolio was comprised of residential real estate and home equity loans, exposing the Company to the risks inherent in financings based upon analyses of credit risk and the value of underlying collateral. Accordingly, the Companys profitability may be negatively impacted by errors in risk analyses, by loan defaults and the ability of certain borrowers to repay such loans may be adversely affected by any downturn in general economic conditions; (vi) economic conditions and interest rate risk could adversely impact the fair value and the ultimate collectibility of the Companys investments. Should an investment be deemed other than temporarily impaired, the Company would be required to writedown the carrying value of the investment through earnings. Such writedown(s) may have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations; 5 Table of Contents (vii) writedown of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2015, our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were approximately $2.7 million; (viii) acts or threats of terrorism and actions taken by the United States or other governments as a result of such acts or threats, including possible military action, could further adversely affect business and economic conditions in the United States of America generally and in the Companys markets, which could adversely affect the Companys financial performance and that of the Companys borrowers and on the financial markets and the price of the Companys Class A common stock; (ix) changes in the extensive laws, regulations and policies governing bank holding companies and their subsidiaries could alter the Companys business environment or affect the Companys operations; (x) the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems, on which the Company is highly dependent to secure bank and customer financial information, could present operational issues, require significant capital spending or impact the Companys reputation; and These factors, as well as general economic and market conditions in the United States of America, may materially and adversely affect the Companys performance, results of operations and the market price of shares of the Companys Class A common stock.
