ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS RISK FACTORS The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock. Risks Relating to Our Business ● IN ORDER TO INCREASE OUR REVENUES, WE BELIEVE WE MUST FURTHER EXPAND OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR INTERNAL GROWTH STRATEGY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL WHICH MAY RESULT IN A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROWTH, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW. In order to maximize the potential growth in our current and potential markets, we believe that we must further expand the scope of our services in the tourism and mass media industry. One of our strategies is to grow internally through increasing the customers we target for advertising campaigns and locations where we promote tourism by penetrating existing markets in the PRC and entering new geographic markets in PRC as well as other parts of Asia and globally. However, many obstacles to this expansion exist, including, but not limited to, increased competition from similar businesses, international trade and tariff barriers, unexpected costs, costs associated with marketing efforts abroad and maintaining attractive foreign exchange ratios. We cannot, therefore, assure you that we will be able to successfully ov ercome such obstacles and establish our services in any additional markets. Our inability to implement this internal growth strategy successfully may have a negative impact on our growth, future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ● IN ADDITION TO OUR INTERNAL GROWTH STRATEGY, WE MAY GROW THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR ACQUISITION GROWTH STRATEGY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL RESULTING IN OUR FAILURE TO MEET GROWTH AND REVENUE EXPECTATIONS. We also intend to pursue opportunities to acquire businesses in the PRC that are complementary or related in product lines and business structure to us. However, we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates at prices that we consider appropriate or to finance acquisitions on terms that are satisfactory to us. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be able to negotiate successfully the terms of an acquisition, or, if the acquisition occurs, integrate the acquired business into our existing business. Acquisitions of businesses or other material operations may require debt financing or additional equity financing, resulting in leverage or dilution of ownership. Integration of acquired business operations could disrupt our business by diverting management away fro m day-to-day operations. The difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures. We also may not be able to maintain key employees or customers of an acquired business or realize cost efficiencies or synergies or other benefits we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates. In addition, we may need to record write-downs from future impairments of intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings. At times, acquisition candidates may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition. In addition to the above, acquisitions in PRC, including state owned businesses, will be required to comply with laws of the PRC, to the extent applicable. There can be no assurance that any given proposed acquisition will be able to comply with PRC requirements, rules and/or regulations, or that we will succes sfully obtain governmental approvals which are necessary to consummate such acquisitions, to the extent required. If our acquisition strategy is unsuccessful, we will not grow our operations and revenues at the rate that we anticipate. ● IN THE EVENT OF RAPID GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT STRAIN ON OUR MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR FAILURE TO MANAGE GROWTH WILL CAUSE A DISRUPTION OF OUR OPERATIONS RESULTING IN THE FAILURE TO GENERATE REVENUE. If we expand our business through successful implementation of our internal growth strategy and/or acquisition strategy, our management and our operational, accounting, and information infrastructure may experience a significant strain caused by such expansion. In order to deal with the strain our anticipated business expansion could put on our resources, we will need to continue to improve our financial controls, operating procedures, and management information systems. We will also need to effectively train, motivate, and manage our employees. Our failure to manage our growth could disrupt our operations and ultimately prevent us from generating the revenues we expect. 10 INDEX ● IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGIES OR EXPAND OUR MEDIA OPERATIONS AND ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL TOURIST ATTRACTIONS, OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. We expanded our business in 2010 by acquiring the operation rights of additional tourist attractions under various agreements, including the City of Caves, Yang-sheng Paradise, Ming Dynasty Entertainment World and FETV. Since 2008, we have entered various agreements for Yongtai Beixi and Jiezhukou Lake, Hua’an Tulou, and the Great Golden Lake, and establishing collaboration with Railway Media Center to produce programs titled “Journey through China on the Train.” Our continuous business development plan is based on a further expansion of our media services and acquisition of additional tourist attractions. There is inherent risks and uncertainties involved throughout these stages of development. There is no assurance that we will be successful in continuously expanding our media operations or acq uiring additional tourist attractions, or that our strategies, even if implemented, will lead to the successful achievement of our objectives. If we are not able to successfully implement these further development strategies, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected. ● TOURISM AND MEDIA ARE COMPETITVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. We operate in a competitive environment and have to compete with other tourist destinations and media outlets in order to attract visitors and customers. In order to be successful in attracting visitors or customers we may be forced to lower prices or spend more money on advertising to continue to compete with our competitors. These competitive measures may result in lower net income. ● ECONOMIC CRISIS OR TURMOIL, OR SUPPRESSION ON INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS MAY CAUSE A DOWNTURN IN CHINA’S TOURISM INDUSTRY. A downturn in the world economic markets, or just the Chinese economy, may have a negative impact on our business. Consumers with a lack of disposable incomes may decide not to vacation or travel to our tourism destinations, which would negatively impact our business. Additionally, the perceived suppression of individual rights by the Chinese government may deter tourists from visiting China, which may cause a decline in visitors to our attraction. ● OUR BUSINESS MAY BE DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY AFFECTED BY UNFAVORABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR NATURAL DISASTERS THAT REDUCE THE VISITS OF OUR RESORTS AND DESTINATIONS Poor or unusual weather conditions, can significantly affect the visits of the tourists to our resorts and destinations. Insufficient levels of rain or drought can cause significant affect to our tourist destination. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also reduce tourists’ volume. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, or other storms, and droughts can have significant negative effects on our tourism business. In the second half of 2010, we had to close part of our tourist destination in Great Golden Lake due to flooding, as a result we had reduced revenue. ● THE SLOW RECOVERY OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS COULD AFFECT THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY AND COST OF EXTERNAL FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS. The slow recovery of the global financial markets from the global economic crisis and turmoil may adversely impact our business, the business and financial condition of our customers and the business of potential investors from whom we expect to generate our potential sources of capital financing. Presently it is unclear to what extent the economic stimulus measures and other actions taken or contemplated by the Chinese governments and other governments throughout the world will mitigate the effects of the negative impact caused by the economic turmoil on our industry and other industries that affect our business. Although these conditions have not presently impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations, the impact of the current crisis on our ability to obtain capital financing in the future, and the cost an d terms of same, is unclear. ● A FAILURE TO EXPAND OUR MEDIA OPERATIONS OR GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS RESTRICTING THE MEDIA INDUSTRY IN CHINA COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS. If our advertising and media operations fail to grow, this would have a negative impact on our future operating results. Further, government regulations, if enacted, restricting media content would negatively affect our media operations. Any restriction on media content would limit the potential amount of customers able to use our media services and negatively impact our financial results. 11 INDEX ● WE DEPEND ON OUR KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND THE LOSS OF THEIR SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. We place substantial reliance upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers, Mr. Chen Minhua, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Ms. Fan Yanling, our Vice President of Operations. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, revenues or prospects. We do not maintain key man life insurance on the lives of these individuals. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified management on acceptable terms in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel in our industry and as a result, our business could be adversely affected. ● WE MAY NEVER PAY ANY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS. We have never paid any dividends. Our board of directors does not intend to distribute dividends in the near future. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. ● WE DO NOT CARRY ANY BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY OR RECALL INSURANCE OR THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY INSURANCE. Operation of our business and facilities involves many risks, including natural disasters, labor disturbances, business interruptions, property damage, personal injury and death. We do not carry any business interruption insurance or third-party liability insurance for our business to cover claims in respect of personal injury or property or environmental damage arising from accidents on our property or relating to our operations. Therefore, we may not have insurance coverage sufficient to cover all risks associated with our business. As a result, we may be required to pay for financial and other losses, damages and liabilities, including those caused by natural disasters and other events beyond our control, out of our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of o perations. ● MANAGEMENT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT CONTROL OVER MATTERS REQUIRING SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE DELAY OR PREVENTION OF A CHANGE IN OUR CONTROL. Mr. Chen Minhua, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, through his common stock ownership, currently has voting power equal to approximately 28.70% of our voting securities. Ms. Fan Yanling, our Vice President of Operations and the spouse of Mr. Chen Minhua, through her common stock ownership, currently has voting power equal to approximately 28.70% of our voting securities. Mr. Chen Minhua and Ms. Fan Yanling have combined voting power in our Company equal to approximately 57.40% of our voting securities. As a result, management through such stock ownership exercises significant control over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership in management may also have the effect of delaying o r preventing a change in control of us that may be otherwise viewed as beneficial by shareholders other than management. ● WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH UNITED STATES CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS. We may incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult fo r us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these newly applicable rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. Even though we have been a reporting company since 1999, this risk applies to us because we completed a share exchange with Keenway Limited in 2007 whereby a Chinese operating company became our wholly owned subsidiary. This Chinese operating company is newly reporting and we are adjusting to the increased disclosure requirements for us to comply with corporate governance and accounting requirements. ● IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY AND TIMELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR PREVENT FRAUD MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX 404, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company’s internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports, including Form 10-K. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a company’s financial statements must also attest to and report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial reporting. Under current SEC rules, we will be required to include a management report and our independent registered public accounting firm’s attestation report beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010. Our management may conclude that our internal co ntrols over our financial reporting are not effective. Even if our management concludes that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. Any of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability 12 INDEX ● WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY RAISING NECESSARY CAPITAL TO FUND OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF MARKET PRICE VOLATILITY FOR OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. In recent years, the securities markets in the United States have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations, performances, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. For these reasons, our shares of common stock can also be expected to be subject to volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control. If our business development plans are successful, we may require additional financing to continue to develop and exploit existing and new products and services related to our industries and to expand into new markets. The exploitation of our services may, therefore, be dependent upon our ability to obtain f inancing through debt and equity or other means. ● WE HAVE A CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH FUJIAN JIAOGUANG MEDIA WHICH MAY BE IN NON-COMPLIANCE WITH PRC LAWS AND DOES NOT PROVIDE THE SAME OPERATIONAL CONTROL AS A DIRECT EQUITY INTEREST. Our contractual relationship with Fujian Jiaoguang Media was structured as a contractual relationship as opposed to a direct equity interest in order to comply with PRC law. We have received a PRC legal counsel attesting that this structure is in compliance with the PRC law. However, the PRC law may be subject to change or the government may review the structure and determine that this contractual relationship is not in compliance with PRC laws and force the termination of this relationship. Additionally, the contractual relationship between us and Fujian Jiaoguang Media does not provide us with the same operational control as a direct equity interest. Therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with contractual rights as opposed to owning the company. Such risks co uld include breach of contract or failure to honor the terms of the contract. Risks Relating to the People's Republic of China ● SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR OPERATING ASSETS ARE LOCATED IN CHINA AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUE WILL BE DERIVED FROM OUR OPERATIONS IN CHINA SO OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND LEGAL POLICIES, DEVELOPMENTS AND CONDITIONS IN CHINA. The PRC’s economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies, could impair our business. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects. China’s GDP has grown consistently since 1978 (National Bureau of Statistics of China). However, we cannot assure you that such growth will be sustained in the future. If, in the future, China’s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected, there may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could impair our ability to remain profitable. The PRC’s economic growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall PRC economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be hindered by PRC government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. The PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Although in recent years the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the use of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the PRC government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. It also exercises significant control over PRC economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.< /font> ● IF THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE, OR MOFCOM, CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION, OR CSRC, OR ANOTHER PRC REGULATORY AGENCY, DETERMINES THAT MOFCOM AND CSRC APPROVAL OF OUR MERGER WAS REQUIRED OR IF OTHER REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS ARE IMPOSED UPON US, WE MAY INCUR SANCTIONS, PENALTIES OR ADDITIONAL COSTS WHICH WOULD DAMAGE OUR BUSINESS. 13 INDEX On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the MOFCOM and the CSRC, promulgated the Rules on Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, a new regulation with respect to the mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors that became effective on September 8, 2006. Article 11 of the M&A Rules requires PRC companies, enterprises or natural persons to obtain MOFCOM approval in order to effectuate mergers or acquisitions between PRC companies and foreign companies legally established or controlled by such PRC companies, enterprises or natural persons. Article 40 of the M&A Rules requires that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for overseas listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or i ndividuals should obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such offshore special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange, especially in the event that the offshore special purpose vehicle acquires shares of or equity interests in the PRC companies in exchange for the shares of offshore companies. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures and filing requirements for offshore special purpose vehicles seeking CSRC approval of their overseas listings. On November 19, 2007, we completed a merger transaction pursuant to a share exchange and stock purchase agreement , which resulted in our current ownership and corporate structure. We believe, based on the opinion of our PRC legal counsel, Allbright Law Offices, that MOFCOM and CSRC approvals were not required for our merger transaction or for the listing and trading of our securities on a trading market because we are not an offshore special purpose vehicle that is directly or indirectly controlled by PRC companies or individuals. Although the merger and acquisition regulations provide specific requirements and procedures, there are still many ambiguities in the meaning of many provisions. Further regulations are anticipated in the future, but until there has been clarification either by pronouncements, regulati on or practice, there is some uncertainty in the scope of the regulations and the regulators have wide latitude in the enforcement of the regulations and approval of transactions. If the MOFCOM, CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that the MOFCOM and CSRC approvals were required, we may face sanctions by the MOFCOM, CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency. If this happens, these regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in China, limit our operating privileges in China, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from this offering into China, restrict or prohibit payment or remittance of dividends paid by Fujian Jintai, or take other actions that could damage our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our securities. ● THE NEW M&A REGULATIONS ESTABLISH MORE COMPLEX PROCEDURES FOR SOME ACQUISITIONS OF CHINESE COMPANIES BY FOREIGN INVESTORS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO PURSUE GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITION IN CHINA. The New M&A Regulations establish additional procedures and requirements that could make some acquisitions of PRC companies by foreign investors, such as ours, more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the approval of the Ministry of Commerce shall be required for transactions involving the shares of an offshore listed company being used as the acquisition consideration by foreign investors. In the future, we may grow our business in part by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the New M&A Regulations to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the Ministry of Commerce, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share. ● IF THE PRC IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS DESIGNED TO REDUCE INFLATION, FUTURE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE PRC COULD BE SEVERELY CURTAILED WHICH COULD HURT OUR BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY. While the economy of the PRC has experienced rapid growth, this growth has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country. Rapid economic growth often can lead to growth in the supply of money and rising inflation. In order to control inflation in the past, the PRC has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending. Imposition of similar restrictions may lead to a slowing of economic growth, a decrease in demand for our steel products and generally damage our business and profitability. ● FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES. The value of our ordinary shares will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Because substantially all of our earnings and cash assets are denominated in RMB and the net proceeds from this offering will be denominated and our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB will affect the relative purchasing power of these proceeds, our balance sheet and our earnings per share in U.S. dollars following this offering. In addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our b usiness or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars as well as earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future. Since July 2005, the RMB has not been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People’s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market. 14 INDEX Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies. ● EXCHANGE CONTROLS THAT EXIST IN THE PRC MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE OUR CASH FLOW EFFECTIVELY. We are subject to the PRC’s rules and regulations on currency conversion. In the PRC, the State Administration for Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, regulates the conversion between Renminbi and foreign currencies. Currently, foreign investment enterprises, or FIEs, are required to apply to the SAFE for “Foreign Exchange Registration Certificates for FIEs.” As a result of our ownership of Fujian Jintai, Fujian Jintai is a FIE. With such registration certificates, which need to be renewed annually, FIEs are allowed to open foreign currency accounts including a “current account” and “capital account.” Currency conversion within the scope of the “current account,” such as remittance of foreign currencies for payment of dividends, can be effected without requiring th e approval of the SAFE. However, conversion of currency in the “capital account,” including capital items such as direct foreign investment, loans and securities, still require approval of the SAFE. Further, any capital contributions to Henan Fujian Jintai by its offshore shareholder must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce in China or its local counterpart. We cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authorities will not impose further restrictions on the convertibility of the Renminbi. Any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use our cash flow for the distribution of dividends to our shareholders or to fund operations it may have outside of the PRC. In August 2008, SAFE promulgated Circular 142, a notice regulating the conversion by FIEs of foreign currency into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. Circular 142 requires that Renminbi converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC unless specifically provided for otherwise. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight over the flow and use of Renminbi funds converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE. The use of such Renminbi may not be changed without approval from SAFE, and may not be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not yet been used. Violations of Circular 142 may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines as set forth in the SAFE rules. ● PRC REGULATION OF LOANS AND DIRECT INVESTMENT BY OFFSHORE HOLDING COMPANIES TO PRC ENTITIES MAY DELAY OR PREVENT US FROM USING THE CASH FLOWS TO MAKE LOANS OR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION TO OUR PRC OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESS. In utilizing our cash flow, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to the PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions, and to our affiliated PRC entities only through loans, in each case subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. In the event that we are prevented from using the funds to fund the operation of our PRC subsidiaries, we will use our best efforts to obtain the required approvals, however, we may not be able to utilize the funds in the event that the PRC laws and regulations do not permit it. In utilizing our cash flow, we, as an offshore holding company of our PRC operating subsidiaries, may use the cash flow to make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. Any loans to our PRC subsidiaries are subject to PRC regulations and approvals. For example, loans by us to finance the activities of our PRC subsidiary, which is a foreign-invested enterprise, cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with SAFE or its local counterpart, and the accumulative amount of foreign currency loans will not exceed the difference between the total investment and the registered capital of our PRC subsidiary, which is a foreign-invested enterprise. We may also decide to finance our PRC subsidiary by means of capital contributions. Any additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, which are foreign-invested enterprises, must be approved by the MOFCOM. We cannot assure you that we can obtain the necessary government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans or capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiaries. If we fail to timely receive such registrations or approvals, or at all, our ability to use the proceeds of this offering and to capitalize our PRC operations would be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. 15 INDEX ● PRC REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFSHORE SPECIAL PURPOSE COMPANIES BY PRC RESIDENTS MAY SUBJECT OUR PRC RESIDENT SHAREHOLDERS TO PERSONAL LIABILITY AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO INJECT CAPITAL INTO OUR PRC SUBSIDIARIES, LIMIT OUR PRC SUBSIDIARIES’ ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE PROFITS TO US, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT US. SAFE issued a public notice in October 2005, or the SAFE notice, requiring PRC residents to register with the local SAFE branch before establishing or controlling any company outside of China for the purpose of capital financing with assets or equities of PRC companies, referred to in the notice as an “offshore special purpose company.” PRC residents that are shareholders of offshore special purpose companies established before November 1, 2005 were required to register with the local SAFE branch before March 31, 2006.The failure of our beneficial owners to timely amend their SAFE registrations pursuant to the SAFE notice or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in the SAFE notice may subject such beneficial owners to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to distribute dividends to our company or otherwise adversely affect our business. ● ANY OUTBREAK OF THE SWINE FLU (H1N1), SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME, OR SARS, THE AVIAN FLU, OR ANOTHER WIDESPREAD PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM IN THE PRC COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS. There have been recent outbreaks of the highly pathogenic Swine Flu, caused by the H1N1 virus, in certain regions of the world, including parts of China, where all of our facilities are located and where all of our sales occur. Our business is dependent upon our ability to attract a large volume of visitors to our tourism destinations, and an outbreak of the Swine Flu, or a renewed outbreak of SARS, the Avian Flu, or another widespread public health problem in China, could have a negative effect on our operations. Any such outbreak could have an impact on our operations as a result of: ● quarantines or closures of our tourist destinations ● the sickness or death of our key officers and employees, and ● a general slowdown in the Chinese economy. Any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems could adversely affect our operations. ● BECAUSE CHINESE LAW GOVERNS MANY OF OUR MATERIAL AGREEMENTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS WITHIN THE PRC OR ELSEWHERE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES OR CAPITAL. Chinese law governs many of our material agreements, some of which may be with Chinese governmental agencies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce any of our material agreements or that remedies will be available outside of the PRC. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws and contracts in the PRC may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The Chinese judiciary is relatively inexperienced in enforcing corporate and commercial law, leading to a higher than usual degree of uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital. ● BECAUSE OUR FUNDS ARE HELD IN BANKS IN UNINSURED PRC BANK ACCOUNTS, THE FAILURE OF ANY BANK IN WHICH WE DEPOSIT OUR FUNDS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE IN BUSINESS. Funds on deposit at banks and other financial institutions in the PRC are often uninsured. A significant portion of our assets are in the form of cash deposited with banks in the PRC, and in the event of a bank failure, we may not have access to our funds on deposit. Depending upon the amount of money we maintain in a bank that fails, our inability to have access to our cash could impair our operations, and, if we are not able to access funds to pay our suppliers, employees and other creditors, we may be unable to continue in business. ● OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SEVERELY HARMED IF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT CHANGES ITS POLICIES, LAWS, REGULATIONS, TAX STRUCTURE OR ITS CURRENT INTERPRETATIONS OF ITS LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS IN CHINA. Our business is located in Fujian, China and virtually all of our assets are located in China. We generate our sales revenue only from customers located in China. Our results of operations, financial state of affairs and future growth are, to a significant degree, subject to China’s economic, political and legal development and related uncertainties. Our operations and results could be materially affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to ● Changes in policies by the Chinese government resulting in changes in laws or regulations or the interpretation of laws or regulations, ● changes in taxation, ● changes in employment restrictions, ● import duties, and ● currency revaluation. 16 INDEX Over the past several years, the Chinese government has pursued economic reform policies including the encouragement of private economic activities and greater economic decentralization. If the Chinese government does not continue to pursue its present policies that encourage foreign investment and operations in China, or if these policies are either not successful or are significantly altered, then our business could be harmed. Following the Chinese government’s policy of privatizing many state-owned enterprises, the Chinese government has attempted to augment its revenues through increased tax collection. It also exercises significant control over China’s economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and p roviding preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Continued efforts to increase tax revenues could result in increased taxation expenses being incurred by us. Economic development may be limited as well by the imposition of austerity measures intended to reduce inflation, the inadequate development of infrastructure and the potential unavailability of adequate power and water supplies, transportation and communications. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry by imposing industrial policies. ● THE CHINESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH GOVERN OUR CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SOMETIMES VAGUE AND UNCERTAIN AND MAY BE CHANGED IN A WAY THAT HURTS OUR BUSINESS. China’s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes, in which system decided legal cases have little value as precedents, unlike the common law system prevalent in the United States. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of Chinese laws and regulations, including but not limited to the laws and regulations governing our business, or the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens, death, bankruptcy and criminal proceedings. The Chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws, and considerable progress has been made in introducing laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxa tion and trade. However, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published cases and judicial interpretation and their lack of force as precedents, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. We are considered an FIE under Chinese laws, and as a result, we must comply with Chinese laws and regulations. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new Chinese laws or regulations may have on our business. If the relevant authorities find us to be in violation of Chinese laws or regulations, they would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation, including, without limitation: levying fines; revoking our business and other licenses; requiring that we restructure our ownership or operations; and requiring that we disconti nue any portion or all of our business. ● A SLOWDOWN OR OTHER ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CHINESE ECONOMY MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS’ DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND OUR BUSINESS. All of our operations are conducted in China and all of our revenues are generated from sales to businesses operating in China. Although the Chinese economy has grown significantly in recent years, such growth may not continue. We do not know how sensitive we are to a slowdown in economic growth or other adverse changes in Chinese economy which may affect demand for precision steel products. A slowdown in overall economic growth, an economic downturn or recession or other adverse economic developments in China may materially reduce the demand for our services and in turn reduce our results of operations. ● FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND CHINESE ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS COULD SUBJECT US TO PENALTIES AND OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. Our executive officers, employees and other agents may violate applicable law in connection with the marketing or sale of our products, including China’s anti-corruption laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, we are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent our transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. The PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. However, corrup tion, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in the PRC. While we intend to implement measures to ensure compliance with the FCPA and Chinese anti-corruption laws by all individuals involved with our company, our employees or other agents may engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our brand and reputation, our sales activities or the price of our ordinary shares could be adversely affected if we become the target of any negative publicity as a result of actions taken by our employees or other agents. 17 INDEX ● THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW PRC EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT LAW AND INCREASES IN THE LABOR COSTS IN CHINA MAY HURT OUR BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY. A new employment contract law became effective on January 1, 2008 in China. It imposes more stringent requirements on employers in relation to entry into fixed-term employment contracts, recruitment of temporary employees and dismissal of employees. In addition, under the newly promulgated Regulations on Paid Annual Leave for Employees, which also became effective on January 1, 2008, employees who have worked continuously for more than one year are entitled to paid vacation ranging from 5 to 15 days, depending on the length of the employee’s service. Employees who waive such vacation entitlements at the request of the employer will be compensated for three times their normal daily salaries for each vacation day so waived. As a result of the new law and regulations, our labor costs may increase. There is no assurance that dis putes, work stoppages or strikes will not arise in the future. Increases in the labor costs or future disputes with our employees could damage our business, financial condition or operating results. ● UNDER THE NEW EIT LAW, CHINA YIDA AND HONG KONG YI TAT MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS “RESIDENT ENTERPRISES” OF CHINA, WHICH MAY SUBJECT CHINA YIDA AND HONG KONG YI TAT TO PRC INCOME TAX ON THEIR TAXABLE GLOBAL INCOME. China passed a new Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the New EIT Law, and its implementation regulations, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the New EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with “de facto management bodies” within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese domestic enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the New EIT Law define de facto management as “substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties” of the enterprise. On April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment Contro lled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or the Notice, further interpreting the application of the New EIT Law and its implementation with respect to non-Chinese enterprises or group controlled offshore entities. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a “non-domestically incorporated resident enterprise” if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate chops, board and shareholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often resident in China. A resident enterprise would be generally subject to the unifor m 25% enterprise income tax rate as to its worldwide income. Although the Notice is directly applicable to enterprises registered in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by Chinese domestic enterprises or groups, it is uncertain whether the PRC tax authorities will make reference to the Notice when determining the resident status of other offshore companies, such as Fujian Jin Tai. Since substantially all of our management is currently based in China, it is likely we may be treated as a Chinese resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The tax consequences of such treatment are currently unclear, as they will depend on how local tax authorities apply or enforce the New EIT Law or the implementation regulations. In addition, under the New EIT Law and implementation regulations, PRC income tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends payable to investors that are “non-resident enterprises” (and that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business) to the extent that such dividends have their source within the PRC unless there is an applicable tax treaty between the PRC and the jurisdiction in which an overseas holder resides which reduces or exempts the relevant tax. Similarly, any gain realized on the transfer of shares by such investors is also subject to the 10% PRC income tax if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within the PRC. If we are considered a PRC “resident enterprise”, it is unclear whether the dividends we pay with respect to our shares, or the gain you may realize from the transfer of our shares, would be treated as income derived from sources within the PRC and be subject to PRC tax. If we are required under the New EIT Law to withhold PRC income tax on our dividends payable to our foreign shareholders, or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of your shares, the value of your investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Generally ● OUR SHAREHOLDERS WILL EXPERIENCE DILUTION AS A RESULT OF THE CONVERSION OF OUR CLASS A WARRANTS. As of the date hereof, we had warrants to purchase 773,812 shares of common stock (these warrants are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $5.00 per share). To the extent such warrants are exercised and converted, there will be further dilution. In addition, in the event that any future financing should be in the form of securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, equity securities, investors may experience additional dilution upon the conversion or exchange of such securities. The warrants were exercisable as of September 6, 2009 and will expire on September 6, 2011. 18 INDEX ● IF OUR COMMON STOCK WERE DELISTED AND DETERMINED TO BE A “PENNY STOCK,” A BROKER-DEALER MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO TRADE OUR COMMON STOCK AND AN INVESTOR MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACQUIRE OR DISPOSE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. If our common stock were removed from listing with the NASDAQ, it may be subject to the so-called “penny stock” rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a “penny stock,” unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a “penny stock,” a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market. Investors in penny s tocks should be prepared for the possibility that they may lose their whole investment. ● OUR FAILURE TO MEET THE LISTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET COULD RESULT IN A DE-LISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK. If after listing we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements and the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to de-list our common stock, which could impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we would take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ’s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ’s listing requirements. ● OUR COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO PRICE VOLATILITY UNRELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock. 19 INDEX ITEM 1B.
