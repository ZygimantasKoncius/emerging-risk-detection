D. Risk Factors  Risks related to the regulation of our business and to our structure  Foreign holders of our ADSs or common shares may be subject to PRC withholding tax on dividends payable by us and on gains realized on the sale of our ADSs or common shares if we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise. Critical Accounting Policies Our assets and liabilities, results of operations and cash flows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given the available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. 73 Table of Contents Revenue recognition Our advertising sales revenues mainly include revenues from television advertisements and are recognized when advertisements are broadcast. Advertising sales are recorded net of provisions for estimated rate adjustments and discounts. Payments received in advance are deferred until earned and such amounts are reported as deferred revenue included in accrued expenses and other payables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our advertising services revenues include revenues from event organization, sponsorship at events, advertising agency services, mobile value-added service and the provision of advisory and consulting services, and are generally recognized as services are provided. Revenues from event organization, such as dramas, include ticketing revenue recognized upon the delivery of tickets or admission to the events, whichever is earlier. Revenues from sponsorship at events are generally recorded over the period of the applicable agreements. In the normal course of business, we place advertising transactions with television and radio stations for third parties. Such transactions are recorded at either a gross or net basis depending on whether we are acting as a principal or as an agent in the transaction. We are considered a principal in the majority of our arrangements, and accordingly, we record these revenues on a gross basis. Factors that support our conclusion mainly include:  we secure the advertising media resources from television, websites and other sources, and as a result, we bear the risk of ownership and are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to sell the purchased resources;  we are able to establish the prices charged to our customers; and  we are obligated to pay for the purchased resources regardless of the collection from the advertising customers and as a result we bear the credit risks for the revenues generated with respect to our services. For those transactions in which we final advertising space for advertisers and do not have substantial risks and rewards of ownership, we are considered an agent in the transaction and, accordingly, records revenue on a net basis. Impairment of goodwill Goodwill represents the cost of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased. We assign all the assets and liabilities of an acquired business, including goodwill, to reporting units. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually as of December 31 and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill impairment is tested using a two-step approach. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. Estimating fair value is performed by utilizing various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being the discounted cash flow method. 74 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the fair values estimated by management or carrying values of goodwill allocated to our reporting units as of December 31, 2009: Upper Step (2) Singshine M-in JCBN Profitown & Beijing Reporting Units XFA (1) Marketing Group China Group Everfame Perspective Total (In thousands) Fair value of reporting unit $ (10,587 ) $ 8,021 $ 18,763 $ 8,581 $ 1,880 $ (39,094 ) $ (11,701 ) $ (24,137 ) Carrying value excluding goodwill (after impairment of other long-lived assets) $ 7,867 $ 9,890 $ 9,468 $ 14,448 $ 786 $ (64,455 ) $ (12,102 ) $ (34,098 ) Implied FV of goodwill $  $  $ 9,295 $  $ 1,093 $  $  N/A Goodwill before impairment $ 9,120 $ 15,340 $ 6,933 $ 36,975 $ 305 $ 10,037 $ 11,689 $ 90,399 Goodwill Impairment $ 9,120 $ 15,340 Nil $ 36,975 Nil $ 10,037 $ 11,689 $ 83,161 Goodwill After impairment Nil Nil $ 6,933 Nil $ 305 Nil Nil $ 7,238 Discount rate used for impairment test 16 % 21 % 17.5 % 20 % 15 % 20 % N/A N/A (1) XSEL Advertising Limited and its wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs (collectively, XFA). (2) Upper Step Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively, Upper Step). The reporting units that carry goodwill balances after the impairment charges in 2009 are presented in the following table: Reporting Units M-in Group Profitown Group (In thousands) Fair value of reporting unit $ 18,763 $ 1,880 Carrying value of reporting unit (after impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets) $ 16,401 $ 1,091 Percentage by which fair value exceeds carrying value 14 % 72 % In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, we considered the income approach to be more reliable than the market approach in determining the fair values of our reporting units. We applied the discounted cash flow, or DCF, analysis based on our projected cash flow using managements best estimate as of December 31, 2009. The projected cash flow estimate included, among other things, an analysis of projected revenue growth, gross margins, effective tax rates, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The income approach involves applying appropriate discount rates, based on earnings forecasts, to estimated cash flows. The key assumptions of our cash flow forecasts we used in deriving the fair values of our reporting units were consistent with the assumptions that we used in developing our business plan. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and subjective. The discount rates reflect the risks our management perceived as being associated with achieving the forecasts and are based on the estimated cost of capital of our reporting units, which was derived by using the capital asset pricing model, after taking into account systemic risks and non-systematic risks. The capital asset pricing model is a model commonly used by market participants for determining the fair values of assets that adds an assumed risk premium rate of return to an assumed risk-free rate of return. Using this method, we determined the discount rates used for impairment tests to be appropriate for determining fair values for the reporting units and we considered the selected discount rates to properly reflect the uncertainty associated with the key assumptions of projected cash flows of our reporting units as of December 31, 2009. 75 Table of Contents The impairment review is highly judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions have a significant impact on the amount of any impairment charge recorded. Discounted cash flow methods are dependent upon assumptions of future sales trends, market conditions and cash flows of each reporting unit over several years. Actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those previously forecasted. Other significant assumptions include growth rates and the discount rate applicable to future cash flows. In 2008, impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets were driven mainly by our repositioning in the sports and entertainment fields and the global economic downturn. In 2009, the impairment losses on goodwill were mainly caused by (i) the release of Rule 61 (Rule 61) in October 2009 by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television of the PRC, which substantially cuts the time allowed for brand advertisements in each hour and the amount of time allotted for infomercials, (ii) the loss of major customers to competitors in the Advertising Group and (iii) the continuing repositioning of our company in the sports and entertainment fields by divestment of certain non-core businesses including our print and content production businesses. Driven by the above mentioned factors, and based on the impairment assessments using various assumptions, we recorded impairment losses on goodwill from continuing operations of $137.3 million and $71.5 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively, and impairment losses on goodwill from discontinued operations of $43.5 million and $11.7 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. No impairment losses were identified in 2007. The remaining balance of goodwill as of December 31, 2009 was $7.2 million, including goodwill of $0.3 million and $6.9 million from reporting units Profitown Group and M-in Group, respectively. Impairment of intangible assets with definite lives We evaluate our intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When these events occur, we measure impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the assets, we recognize an impairment loss as the excess of carrying amounts over fair value of the assets. In estimating fair value of intangible assets, we typically use the income method, which starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with a particular intangible asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Estimates of fair value involve a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any changes in key assumptions, including unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the assets economic life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory or economic barriers to entry. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Impairment losses on intangible assets from continuing operations of $11.9 million and $98.4 million and from discontinued operations of $13.7 million and $86.2 million were identified in 2008 and 2009, respectively. No impairment losses on intangible assets were identified in 2007. 76 Table of Contents Allowance for doubtful accounts We regularly evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when we believe there is a risk to the collectability of accounts receivable. We review the aging analysis of accounts receivable and make an assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts, including evaluating the credit worthiness and financial condition of our customers and considering our historical experience with bad debts. Actual collections of the accounts receivable could differ significantly from the original estimates. Allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2009 was $8.1 million. Income taxes Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities. Deferred income taxes are recognized when temporary differences exist between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Net operating loss carry forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that a portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. The impact of an uncertain income tax position on an income tax return is recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest and penalties on income taxes will be classified as a component of the provisions for income taxes. We did not identify significant unrecognized tax benefits for years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009. We did not incur any interest and penalties related to potential underpaid income tax expenses and also believe that our unrecognized tax benefits did not change significantly within the 12 months ending December 31, 2009. We consider our company to be permanently reinvested with respect to our investment in our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly no deferred income tax liability related to our foreign subsidiaries unremitted earnings have been included in our provision for income taxes. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to income taxes and withholding taxes payable in various non-Cayman jurisdictions, which could potentially be offset by foreign tax credits. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation. A deferred tax liability should be recorded for taxable temporary differences attributable to the excess of financial reporting amounts over tax basis amounts, including those differences attributable to a more than 50% interest in a domestic subsidiary in China. However, recognition is not required in situations where the tax law provides a means by which the reported amount of that investment can be recovered tax-free and the enterprise expects that it will ultimately use such means. We have not recorded any deferred tax liability attributable to the undistributed earnings of our financial interest in our VIE affiliates in China because we believe such excess earnings can be distributed in a manner that would not be subject to tax. On April 21, 2010, the State Administration of Taxation issued Circular 157 titled Further Clarification on Implementation of Preferential EIT Rate during Transition Periods, or Circular 157. Circular 157 seeks to provide additional guidance on the interaction of certain preferential tax rates under the transitional rules of the New EIT Law. Prior to Circular 157, we interpreted the law to mean that if an entity was in a period where it was entitled to a 50% reduction in the tax rate and was also entitled to a 15% rate of tax due to its HNTE status under the New EIT Law, it was entitled to pay tax at the rate of 7.5%. Circular 157 appears to have the effect that such an entity is entitled to pay tax at either 15% or 50% of the standard PRC tax rate. The effect of Circular 157 is retrospective and would apply to 2008 and 2009. As a consequence of Circular 157, the preferential tax rate enjoyed by one of our subsidiaries which qualified as a HNTE during its 50% reduction period (2008 and 2009) will be 12.5% for the relevant years rather than 7.5%, which is the rate we had used prior to the issuance of Circular 157. Because we believe that Circular 157 is similar to a change in tax law, the cumulative effect thereof should be reflected in the period of the change. As a result, we will recognize an additional tax liability in the second quarter of 2010 of approximately $0.2 million ($137,972 related to 2008 and $63,837 related to 2009) in respect of this change. 77 Table of Contents Valuation of share-based compensation All share-based payments, including grants of stock options, restricted stock units and non-vested shares, are required to be recognized in our financial statements based upon their respective grant date fair values. We currently use the Binomial option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share-based awards. The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards utilizing the Binomial model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, expected dividends and the trigger price multiple. The risk-free rate is based on the yield to maturity of the US Treasury Bond as of the grant date with maturity closest to the relevant award expiry date. Because we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility for our shares, the expected volatility was based on the historical volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar lines of business. The trigger price multiple represents the value of the underlying stock as a multiple of the exercise price of the option or warrant which, if achieved, results in exercise of the option or warrant. The trigger price multiple is estimated based on an empirical study on the exercise behavior of employee stock options. Employees who received our share-based awards are assumed to exhibit similar behavior. Results of Operations The following table sets forth a summary of the consolidated statements of operations of our company for the periods indicated. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements of our company, including the related notes, that appear elsewhere in this annual report. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to predict our future operating results. Therefore, our historical consolidated results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations you may expect for any future period.

Year ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net revenues. We generated net revenues of $121.5 million and $99.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively, from the following sources:  Advertising services. Our net revenues from advertising services were $99.6 million and $78.0 million, and constituted 82.0% and 78.6% of our total net revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Our advertising services for 2008 and 2009 were derived primarily from advertising agency services for billboard and website advertising medium and mobile value-added services, and marketing services, including event organization, visual design and production. Our advertising services revenues decreased by $21.6 million between 2008 and 2009 primarily due to a decrease in below-the-line marketing services. Our advertising service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues decreased in line with the decrease in overall advertising sales.  Advertising sales. Our net revenues from advertising sales were $21.9 million and $21.2 million, and constituted 18.0% and 21.4% of our total net revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Our advertising sales revenues for 2008 mainly represented advertising revenues generated by billboard advertising. Our advertising sales revenues for 2009 mainly represented revenue generated by sales of advertising and sponsorship on Shaanxi Satellite Television. Our advertising sales revenues decreased between 2008 and 2009 due to our disposal of Convey. Cost of revenues. Our total cost of revenues was $80.7 million and $85.4 million, and constituted 66.4% and 86.1% of our total net revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Our total cost of revenues consisted of the following:  Advertising services. Our advertising services costs of $71.2 million and $61.9 million accounted for 88.3% and 72.4% of our total cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Our advertising services costs in 2008 and 2009 were derived primarily from advertising agency services for billboard and website advertising medium and mobile value-added services, and marketing services, including event organization, visual design and production. Our advertising services costs decreased by $9.3 million between 2008 and 2009 primarily due to a decrease in below-the-line market services. Our advertising services costs as a percentage of total cost of revenues fell in line with the decrease in revenues attributable to advertising services as a percentage of total net revenues. 79 Table of Contents  Advertising sales. Our advertising sales costs of $9.5 million and $23.6 million constituted 11.7% and 27.6% of our total cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Our advertising sales costs in 2008 primarily consisted of costs associated with our outdoor advertising network. Our advertising sales costs in 2009 primarily consisted of the cost of operating Shaanxi Satellite Television and amortization costs incurred in connection with obtaining the license rights for Shaanxi Satellite Television. Our advertising sales costs increased by $14.1 million between 2008 and 2009 primarily due to higher costs for operating television compared with outdoor advertising. Operating expenses. Our total operating expenses of $220.9 million and $237.9 million constituted 181.9% and 239.7% of our total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively, and consisted of the following:  Selling and distribution expenses. Our selling and distribution expenses of $10.7 million and $7.7 million represented 4.8% and 3.2% of our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Our selling and distribution expenses decreased by $3.0 million between 2008 and 2009 primarily due to a decrease in amortization expenses of $2.7 million. Our selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of our total operating expenses decreased between 2008 and 2009 primarily due to a significant increase in general and administrative expenses and impairment charges.  General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses were $45.6 million and $27.8 million, or 20.7% and 11.7% of our total operating expenses, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses decreased by $17.7 million between 2008 and 2009 primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation expenses, staff cost, auditor remuneration and a group service charge to XFL of $9.9 million, $2.0 million, $1.9 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our total operating expenses decreased in line with the decrease in general and administrative expenses.  Impairment charges. We had impairment charges of $159.9 million and $176.8 million, or 72.4% and 74.3% of our total operating expenses, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. The impairment charges in 2008 mainly included impairment of goodwill of $137.3 million and intangible assets of $11.9 million in connection with our acquisitions of XFA, JCBN China, M-In Group and Singshine Communication. The impairment of goodwill and intangible assets was mainly due to a decrease in the fair value of the reporting units affected by the slowdown in the global economy and the repositioning of our business to sports and entertainment. The impairment charges in 2009 included impairment of goodwill of $71.5 million and intangible assets of $98.4 million in connection with our acquisitions of XFA, JCBN China, M-In Group, Singshine Communication and Everfame. The impairment of goodwill and intangible assets was the result of a decrease in the fair value of the reporting units affected by the slowdown in the global economy and termination of business units, resulting from our repositioning to the sports and entertainment fields.  Loss on disposal of subsidiaries. We had a loss on disposal of subsidiaries of $4.7 million and $25.6 million, or 2.1% and 10.8% of our total operating expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. The loss on disposal of subsidiaries in 2008 was due to loss on disposal of our 85% equity interest in Convey. On December 31, 2008 we entered into an agreement with Pariya Holdings Limited for the sale of Convey. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the total consideration to be paid for the asset transfer is $85.0 million and is subject to deduction of an earnout payment, which is estimated to be approximately $10.6 million. The consideration will be paid in six interest-free installment payments from the date of disposal through the end of 2012. Should the actual net income of Convey for the 2008 earnout period be lower or higher than currently estimated, there would be a corresponding impact on the loss. The range of this potential impact ranges from a reduction of the loss by approximately $11.0 million, thus becoming a gain on disposal of the subsidiary of $7.0 million, to an additional loss of approximately $29.0 million. The loss on disposal of subsidiaries in 2009 was due to provision for consideration receivable of $25.6 million for disposal of our 85% equity interest in Convey driven by the uncertain visibility for settlement of certain amounts receivable as determined during the fourth quarter of 2009. 80 Table of Contents Other operating income. We recorded other operating income of $1.3 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Other operating income in 2008 was primarily due to a refund of previously paid business tax of $0.9 million. Other operating income in 2009 was primarily due to a refund of previously paid business tax of $0.7 million and a return on liquidation of a subsidiary of $0.6 million. Other income (expense), net. We had other expenses, net, of $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and other income, net, of $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Other expenses, net, in 2008 primarily included interest expense in connection with a bank loan and other liabilities, imputed interest on long-term obligations net of interest income of $1.1 million, an impairment charge associated with a principal protected note of $24.9 million and an impairment charge for our cost method investments of $1.3 million. The principal protected note was purchased from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., or Lehman Brothers, for $25.0 million. On the maturity date, the principal protected note could have been redeemed at 100% plus a variable amount based on the performance of the FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index. Due to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, we are of the view that we cannot recover the principal protected note. Full provision of $24.9 million has been made against the value of the principal protected note. We recorded an impairment loss of $1.3 million on our cost method investment, which was the result of the cost of our investments exceeding our estimated fair value of these investments. We had other income, net, of $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which primarily included interest expense in connection with a bank loan and other liabilities, imputed interest on long-term obligations net of interest income of $9.1 million, a non-cash fair value loss on an embedded derivative on a convertible loan of $0.3 million, a non-cash fair value loss on warrants of $2.6 million, a non-cash net gain from the settlement of a proceeding with UBS of $13.5 million and an impairment charge for our cost method investments of $1.3 million. We recorded an impairment loss of $2.0 million on our cost method investment, which was the result of the cost of our investments exceeding our estimated fair value of these investments. Provision for income taxes (benefit). For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, we recorded an income tax expense of $1.7 million and an income tax benefit of $4.1 million, respectively. In 2008, we recorded a provision of $6.4 million for income taxes offset by a $4.7 million deferred tax credit. Our effective tax rate was 0.8% for the year. In 2009, we recorded a provision of $1.4 million for income taxes offset by a $5.5 million deferred tax credit. Our effective tax rate was 1.9% for the year. The change in provision for income taxes was mainly due to the increased profitability of our subsidiaries. Net loss from continuing operations. We had a net loss from continuing operations of $208.0 million and $213.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

Year ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net revenues. We generated net revenues of $83.5 million and $121.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively, from the following sources:  Advertising services. Our net revenues from advertising services were $75.3 million and $99.6 million, and constituted 90.2% and 82.0% of our total net revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Our advertising services for 2007 and 2008 were derived primarily from advertising agency services for billboard and website advertising medium and mobile value-added services, and marketing services, including event organization, visual design and production. Our advertising services revenue increased by $24.3 million between 2007 and 2008 primarily due to an increase in the number of mobile users in China, full year operation of our subsidiaries acquired in 2007, an increase in sales for our advertising platforms and the growth of our business generally. Our advertising service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues decreased primarily due to greater growth in other parts of our business.  Advertising sales. Our net revenues from advertising sales were $8.1 million and $21.9 million, and constituted 9.8% and 18.0% of our total net revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Our advertising sales revenues for 2007 and 2008 included advertising revenues generated by billboard advertising. Our advertising sales revenues increased by $13.8 million between 2007 and 2008 mainly due to full year operation of Convey which we acquired in 2007. Cost of revenues. Our total cost of revenues was $58.1 million and $80.7 million, and constituted 69.6% and 66.4% of our total net revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively.

Our advertising sales costs of $3.8 million and $9.5 million constituted 6.6% and 11.7% of our total cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Our advertising sales costs in 2007 and 2008 primarily represented our outdoor advertising network. Our advertising sales costs increased by $5.7 million between 2007 and 2008 primarily due to full year operation of Convey which we acquired in 2007. Operating expenses. Our total operating expenses of $23.6 million and $220.9 million constituted 28.2% and 43.3% of our total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and consisted of the following:  Selling and distribution expenses. Our selling and distribution expenses were $5.7 million and $10.7 million, representing 24.0% and 4.8% of our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Our selling and distribution expenses increased by $5.0 million between 2007 and 2008 primarily due to the net off effect of an increase in amortization expense of $3.0 million, an increase in staff cost of $2.6 million and a decrease in marketing cost of $0.5 million. Our selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of our total operating expenses decreased between 2007 and 2008 primarily due to a significant increase in other operating expenses, such as impairment charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries. 82 Table of Contents  General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses were $17.9 million and $45.6 million, or 76.0% and 20.7% of our total operating expenses, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses increased by $27.7 million between 2007 and 2008 primarily due to an increase in staff cost of $4.7 million, an increase in share-based compensation expenses of $9.4 million, an increase in legal and professional fees of $3.0 million and an increase in rental expense of $1.1 million. Our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our total operating expenses decreased between 2007 and 2008 primarily due to a significant increase in other operating expenses, such as impairment charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries.  Impairment charges. We had impairment charges of $159.9 million, or 72.4% of our total operating expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions of XFA, JCBN China, M-In Group and Singshine Communication. The impairment of goodwill of $137.3 million and intangible assets of $11.9 million was a result of (i) the decrease in the fair value of the reporting units affected by the slowdown in the global economy and the repositioning of our business to sports and entertainment and (ii) impairment of a promissory note issued by Sino Investment with accrued interest in the aggregate of $8.5 million due to the Sino Investments default with respect to interest payments.  Loss on disposal of subsidiaries. We had a loss on disposal of subsidiaries of $4.7 million, or 2.1% of our total operating expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2008, due to loss on disposal of our equity interest in Convey. On December 31, 2008 we entered into an agreement with Pariya Holdings Limited for the sale of Convey. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the total consideration to be paid for the asset transfer is $85.0 million and is subject to deduction of an earnout payment, which is estimated to be approximately $10.6 million. The consideration will be paid in six interest-free installment payments from the date of disposal through the end of 2012. Should the actual net income of Convey for the earn-out period be lower or higher than currently estimated, there would be a corresponding impact on the loss. The range of this potential impact ranges from a reduction of the loss by approximately $11.0 million, thus becoming a gain on disposal of the subsidiary of $7.0 million, to an additional loss of approximately $29.0 million. Other operating income. We recorded other operating income of $2.3 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Other operating income in 2007 primarily included reimbursement of initial public offering related expenses by The Bank of New York Mellon in the first quarter of 2007. The initial public offering related expenses had been recorded in the 2006 income statement as operating expenses because they were not considered to be directly related to sales of securities and instead related primarily to audit fees and fees paid to consultants during the listing period. Other operating income in 2008 was primarily due to a refund of previously paid business tax. Other income (expense), net. We had other income, net, of $5.7 million and other expenses, net, of $27.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Other income, net, in 2007 included interest expense of a convertible loan and other liabilities net of interest income, interest income from a loan to a related party of $1.2 million and a realized gain on a currency linked note of $0.7 million. Other expenses, net, in 2008 primarily included interest expense in connection with a bank loan and other liabilities, imputed interest on long-term obligations net of interest income of $1.5 million, an impairment charge associated with a principal protected note of $24.9 million and an impairment charge for our cost method investments of $1.3 million. The principal protected note was purchased from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., or Lehman Brothers, for $25.0 million. On the maturity date, the principal protected note could be redeemed at 100% plus a variable amount based on the performance of the FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index. Due to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, we are of the view that we cannot recover the principal protected note. Full provision of $24.9 million has been made against the value of the principal protected note. We recorded an impairment loss of $1.3 million on our cost method investment, which was the result of the cost of our investments exceeding our estimated fair value of these investments. 83 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes (benefit). For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, we recorded provision for income tax expense of $0.7 million and $1.7 million, respectively.

In 2008, we recorded a provision of $6.4 million for income taxes offset by a $4.7 million deferred tax credit. Our effective tax rate was -0.8% for the year.

The net loss from discontinued operations net of taxes in 2008 was mainly attributable to an impairment loss of goodwill and intangible assets of $57.2 million. Discontinued operations for this period included Upper Step, Beijing Perspective, Accord Group Investments Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively, Accord Group), Beijing Century Media, Economic Observer Advertising and its subsidiaries (collectively, Economic Observer Advertising), EconWorld Media, Shanghai Hyperlink Market Research Co., Ltd., and its subsidiaries (collectively, Hyperlink) and our content production business Small World.

Ltd.

Segment Discussion for Continuing Operations During 2009, we operated our business in two segments: Broadcast and Advertising. We also operated a print business in 2009, the operations of which were either sold or terminated at the end of 2009 and are now categorized as discontinued operations. Each of the operating groups is separately organized and provides distinct services to different customers. Each group prepares a stand-alone financial reporting package including information such as revenue, expense, and goodwill.

The decrease in our net revenues between 2008 and 2009 from the Advertising Group was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue derived from billboards as a result of our disposal of Convey at the end of 2008 and a decrease in the revenue from below-the-line marketing services due to strong competition in that market.  Broadcast. Our net revenues from the Broadcast Group were $13.2 million and $37.1 million, and constituted 10.8% and 37.4% of our total net revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

Our net revenues from the Broadcast Group in 2008 primarily consisted of sales of advertising and sponsorship on Shaanxi Satellite Television and sales of mobile value-added services. Our net revenues from the Broadcast Group increased between 2008 and 2009 primarily due to an increase in the number of mobile users in China and the acquisition of Everfame Group, which through June 30, 2010 held the exclusive advertising right for Shaanxi Satellite Television. 85 Table of Contents Cost of revenues and other expenses excluding depreciation and amortization.

B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash generated from financing activities, which consist of funds raised in our initial public offering, bank borrowings, private placements of convertible preferred shares to, and borrowings from, Patriarch Partners, and a private placement of convertible preferred shares to Yucaipa. See Item 7.B. Major shareholders and related party transactions  Related party transactions  Transactions with Patriarch Partners and Item 7.B. Major shareholders and related party transactions  Related party transactions  Transactions with Yucaipa. As of December 31, 2009, we had $13.3 million in cash and $40.4 million in restricted cash. We do not have direct access to cash or future earnings of any of our PRC affiliated entities but can direct the use of their cash through agreements that provide us with effective control of these entities. See Item 4.C. Information on the Company  Organizational structure  Agreements that provide effective control over our affiliated entities. On October 21, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement with Zohar CDO 2003-1, Limited and Zohar II 2005-1, Limited, as lenders, together with Patriarch, as agent for the lenders. The facility is for a term of four years and is secured by a pledge of our television assets. See Item 7.B. Major shareholders and related party transactions  Related party transactions  Transactions with Patriarch Partners  2008 convertible loan facility agreement among us, Zohar CDO 2003-1, Limited and Zohar II 2005-1, Limited, together with Patriarch Partners Agency Services LLC. As of December 31, 2009, we had drawn a total of $57.8 million from the loan facility. We did not meet certain financial covenants contained in the secured convertible loan facility for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, for which we received a waiver. We also did not meet these financial covenants for the quarters ended December 31, 2009, March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010. We entered into an amendment and waiver to the secured convertible loan facility on July 12, 2010, which effectively waives our breach of financial covenants for the quarters ended December 31, 2009, March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010 and up to the date of the amendment, and lowers the financial covenant requirements on a prospective basis. In connection therewith, we repaid $16.3 million of the convertible loan balance of which $8.7 million was repaid from the proceeds from the sale of our printing business and the remaining $7.6 million was repaid through an additional term loan from Patriarch. In connection with the amendment to the secured convertible loan facility, we designated and issued Series C preferred shares to the lenders. While our prior breaches of these financial covenants have been waived, given our current financial circumstances we cannot be certain that we will not breach the new financial covenants. Therefore, we continue to classify the convertible loan as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009. A loan from Sino Investment in the amount of $1.5 million, which we incurred in relation to our acquisition of the Accord Group, was waived in 2007. The waived amount was recorded as a shareholders contribution and included in paid-in capital. 87 Table of Contents We require cash to fund our ongoing business needs, particularly future acquisitions. Since our incorporation on November 7, 2005, we have made a number of strategic acquisitions and expect to continue to acquire businesses that complement our existing operations. See  Acquisitions. We may not have sufficient cash to settle our payment obligations over the course of the next 12 months.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements On June 12, 2009, the FASB issued an authoritative pronouncement, which changes how a company determines whether an entity should be consolidated when such entity is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled by the company through voting (or similar rights). The determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, the entitys purpose and design and the companys ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. The pronouncement is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 90 Table of Contents In October 2009, the FASB issued an authoritative pronouncement regarding the revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. This pronouncement was issued in response to practice concerns related to accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables under the existing pronouncement. Although the new pronouncement retains the criteria from existing authoritative literature for when delivered items in a multiple-deliverable arrangement should be considered separate units of accounting, it removes the previous separation criterion that objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of any undelivered items must exist for the delivered items to be considered separate units of accounting. The new pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Entities can elect to apply this pronouncement (1) prospectively to new or materially modified arrangements after the pronouncements effective date or (2) retrospectively for all periods presented. Early application is permitted; however, if the entity elects prospective application and early adopts this pronouncement after its first interim reporting period, it must also do the following in the period of adoption: (1) retrospectively apply this pronouncement as of the beginning of that fiscal year and (2) disclose the effect of the retrospective adjustments on the prior interim periods revenue, income before taxes, net income, and earnings per share. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of adoption of this pronouncement. In April 2010, the FASB issued an authoritative pronouncement regarding the milestone method of revenue recognition. The scope of this pronouncement is limited to arrangements that include milestones relating to research or development deliverables. The pronouncement specifies guidance that must be met for a vendor to recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. The guidance applies to milestones in arrangements within the scope of this pronouncement regardless of whether the arrangement is determined to have single or multiple deliverables or units of accounting. The pronouncement will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early application is permitted. Companies can apply this guidance prospectively to milestones achieved after adoption. However, retrospective application to all prior periods is also permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In April 2010, FASB issued an authoritative pronouncement regarding the effect of denominating the exercise price of a share-based payment award in the currency of the market in which the underlying equity securities trades and that currency is different from (1) entitys functional currency, (2) functional currency of the foreign operation for which the employee provides services, and (3) payroll currency of the employee. The guidance clarifies that an employee share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entitys equity securities trades should be considered an equity award assuming all other criteria for equity classification are met. The pronouncement will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010, and will be applied prospectively. Affected entities will be required to record a cumulative catch-up adjustment for all awards outstanding as of the beginning of the annual period in which the guidance is adopted. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of the adoption of this pronouncement. C. Research and Development We do not make, and do not expect to make, significant expenditures on research and development activities. D. Trend Information Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events for the period from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that caused the disclosed financial information to not be necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions. 91 Table of Contents E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We did not enter into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as owners and shareholders equity, or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity.

We sold Convey back to its original equity owners on December 31, 2008. As the audited operating results of Convey through June 30, 2009 have not yet been determined, we did not record any additional contingent consideration payable in 2009. The maximum possible contingent consideration in connection with this transaction is $29.4 million. Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees A.

Related Party Transactions Contractual arrangements with our affiliated entities and their shareholders PRC laws and regulations currently limit foreign equity ownership of companies that engage in media, advertising and market research businesses. To comply with these foreign ownership restrictions, we operate a substantial portion of our businesses in China through a series of contractual arrangements with our affiliated entities and their shareholders. For a description of these contractual arrangements, see Item 4.C. Information on the Company  Organizational structure  Agreements that provide effective control over our affiliated entities, Item 4.C. Information on the Company  Organizational structure  Agreements that provide the option to purchase the equity interest in the affiliated entity and Item 4.C.  Organizational structure  Agreements that transfer economic benefits to us. Transactions with XFL or its subsidiaries Any transactions entered into with XFL, its predecessor or its subsidiaries are treated as related party transactions, as set forth below: Contracts between us and XFL or its subsidiaries On September 13, 2006, we entered into a Group Services Agreement with XFL. Under this agreement, certain services shall be provided to us in exchange for a variable charge. The agreement covers a wide range of services including management, human resources, finance, legal, corporate communications, public relations, information technology and administrative services. On January 25, 2007, the Group Services Agreement was amended to provide that charges for 2006 under the agreement would not exceed $700,000 and for subsequent years would not exceed $1.0 million. On January 1, 2009, we amended and restated our agreement with XFL. Under the amended and restated agreement, XFL will provide us with only legal services and the service charge will be 50% of the actual cost incurred by XFLs legal department. We incurred charges of $0.0 million, $0.7 and $0.3 million for 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively, under the Group Services Agreement. We have a verbal space arrangement with a subsidiary of XFL, pursuant to which we share costs under a lease held by the subsidiary. We paid $0.4 million, $0.3 million and $0.3 million pursuant to this agreement in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. The terms and prices of these transactions, taken as a whole, were determined on an arms-length basis and we believe we could have obtained comparable terms from independent third parties. 103 Table of Contents Loan agreements and foreign currency agreement between us and XFL or its subsidiaries On March 31, 2006, we issued a promissory note in the amount of $38.2 million for the benefit of Xinhua Financial Network and a promissory note in the amount of $68.5 million for the benefit of XFL. Both notes were due on demand and the interest rates were not specified. We issued the promissory notes to borrow money from XFL and Xinhua Financial Network to pay for the costs related to our acquisition from XFL of equity interests XFL held before March 31, 2006 in XFA, the contractual control XFL held before March 31, 2006 in Beijing Century Media and advances from XFL and Xinhua Financial Network enabling us to acquire 19.0% equity interest in Upper Step, and Accord Group Investments Limited. During the year ended December 31, 2007, XFL paid on our behalf earnout consideration related to our acquisitions of Beijing Century Media and XFA of $7.4 million and $25.0 million, respectively, and direct costs of $0.2 million. We repaid $50.0 million in cash to XFL in 2007 and the remaining balance of $113.5 million dollars was permanently waived. For the year ended December 31, 2008, XFL and its subsidiaries paid on our behalf earnout considerations of $2.8 million, $4.5 million and $14.0 million for the acquisitions of Hyperlink, Beijing Century Media and XFA, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance of $26.3 million, which included earnout consideration of $5.0 million $2.3 million, $4.6 million and $14.0 million for our acquisitions of Economic Observer Advertising, Hyperlink, Beijing Century Media and XFA, respectively, was waived by XFL in 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we owed $1.1 million to XFL and its subsidiaries, which mainly represented corporate overhead expenses paid by XFL on behalf of our company. On March 5, 2009, we, Xinhua Sports & Entertainment (Shanghai) Limited, Xinhua Financial Network and Shanghai Huacai Investment Advisory Co. Ltd. (Huacai), a subsidiary of XFL, entered into an agreement, pursuant to which Huacai advanced RMB 42.8 million (approximately US$6.6 million) to Xinhua Sports & Entertainment (Shanghai) Limited, secured by our U.S. dollar deposits in the amount of $6.23 million. The agreement is to facilitate the conversion of the excess U.S. dollars we hold into RMB for working capital purpose. The terms of this agreement were determined on an arms-length basis. On April 7, 2009, Xinhua Sports & Entertainment (Shanghai) Limited repaid the loan and Huacai advanced another RMB42.8 million (approximately US$6.6 million) to Xinhua Sports & Entertainment (Shanghai) Limited on April 21, 2009. Interest expenses of approximately $0.2 million and interest income of approximately $0.2 million were recognized for the year ended December 31, 2009 for these loans and security deposits. As of December 31, 2009, we owed $0.8 million to XFL and its subsidiaries, which mainly represented security loans to XFN and accrued interest of $6.4 million offset by (i) corporate overhead expenses due to XFL of $0.4 million, (ii) the loan from Huacai and accrued interest of $6.4 million and (iii) corporate overhead expenses paid by XFL on behalf of our company of $0.3 million. Transactions involving our acquisitions See Item 5.A. Operating and financial review and prospects  Operating Results  Acquisitions. The terms and pricing of each acquisition, taken as a whole, were determined on an arms-length basis between the sellers and the buyers and we believe the terms are comparable to terms that could have been obtained from independent third parties. However, we received assistance from XFL and Xinhua Financial Network in executing these acquisitions and in certain instances the acquisition target was initially acquired by XFL and injected to us in exchange for certain consideration. We received favorable terms from XFL and Xinhua Financial Network as we are part of the Xinhua Finance Limited group. Transactions with David U.

The terms and conditions of the extension are substantially the same as the original services agreement entered into between the parties in April 2010, with the exception of one modification that specifies how the parties work together. Under the extension, for business transactions that Leeding Media submits to Xinhua Media Entertainment for consideration, if Xinhua Media Entertainment elects to not proceed with the transaction, then Leeding Media shall have right to work with third parties on terms and conditions that are substantially the same as terms and conditions originally presented to Xinhua Media Entertainment. Transactions with Shanghai Wai Gao Qiao (Group) Co., Ltd. Shanghai Wai Gao Qiao (Group) Co., Ltd., or Wai Gao Qiao, held 2.4% of the equity interest in us as of May 31, 2010 via its wholly-owned subsidiary, Honour Rise Services Limited. The transactions we entered into with Wai Gao Qiao and its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Shanghai Camera, are treated as related party transactions, as set forth below. The terms and prices of these transactions, taken as a whole, were determined on an arms-length basis and we believe we could have obtained comparable terms from independent third parties. In January 2007, through an entrusted loan arrangement with the Agricultural Bank of China, our affiliated entity, Shanghai Yuan Zhi Advertising Co., Ltd., loaned $2.3 million (RMB15.5 million) to Shanghai Wai Gao Qiao Free Trade Zone Development Co., Ltd. to finance their working capital. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing and will mature in January 2010. The loan was fully repaid in 2008. In December 2008, through an entrusted loan arrangement with the Agricultural Bank of China, Shanghai Yuan Zhi Advertising Co., Ltd., our affiliated entity, loaned $2.3 million (RMB15.5 million) to Wai Gao Qiao to finance its working capital. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing and will mature in December 2011. Wai Gao Qiao has, however, verbally agreed to repay this loan on demand. In December 2009, we terminated the strategic cooperation relationship with Shanghai Camera and we have made full provision for the outstanding loan of $2.3 million (RMB15.5 million) for the year ended December 31, 2009. Agreements regarding Shanghai Camera Media Investment Co., Ltd. See Item 4.B. Information on the Company  Business overview  Arrangements with partners and suppliers  Agreements regarding Shanghai Camera. We loaned $1.7 million to Shanghai Camera for working capital purposes in 2006 and an additional $0.3 million in 2008. The loan rolls over on a year-to-year basis and carries no interest. The maximum amount drawable under the loan is RMB30.0 million ($4.4 million). Shanghai Camera repaid $2.0 million in other loans to us in 2007. In December 2009, we terminated the strategic cooperation relationship with Shanghai Camera and we have made full provision for the outstanding loan and due balance of US$5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Transactions with Patriarch Partners Patriarch Partners and its affiliates held 4.5% of the equity interests of XFL and 24.0% of our equity interests as of May 31, 2010. Patriarch Partners held 15,585,254 of our convertible preferred shares before our initial public offering, which automatically converted into 15,585,254 common shares upon the completion of our initial public offering. We accrued a premium over the redemption period of the preferred shares as a deemed dividend with a debit to our retained earnings of $2.2 million for the period from the date of issuance of the preferred shares to July 24, 2006. Dividends declared to redeemable convertible preferred shares were $5.3 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. No further dividends are payable on the preferred shares that were held by Patriarch Partners. 105 Table of Contents Under our then Memorandum and Articles of Association, Patriarch Partners, as a holder of our convertible preferred shares, was entitled to vote on an as converted basis together with the holders of our common shares. Moreover, subject to certain exceptions, we had to obtain prior written consent from Patriarch Partners before, among other things, incurring certain indebtedness or liens, entering into certain transactions with shareholders or affiliates, entering into certain merger agreements or issuing any common shares. As the result of its shareholding in us and XFL and the influence over us conferred by our Memorandum and Articles of Association, Patriarch Partners has significant influence over us. The transactions we entered into with Patriarch Partners are treated as related party transactions, as set forth below. The terms and prices of these transactions, taken as a whole, were determined on an arms-length basis, and we believe we could have obtained comparable terms from independent third parties. Share purchase agreement between us and Patriarch Partners Patriarch Partners entered into a share purchase agreement with us on March 16, 2006, agreeing to purchase 16,404,926 of our convertible preferred shares for $60.0 million. Patriarch Partners also agreed to purchase 5,468,309 additional convertible preferred shares for $20.0 million, but did not do so because we did not purchase additional assets for which the additional $20.0 million was to be raised. The purchase price was determined through our arms-length transaction with Patriarch Partners. In connection with our issuance and sale of convertible preferred shares in March 2006, we entered into an investor rights agreement and credit agreement with Patriarch Partners. Investor rights agreement among us, Patriarch Partners and XFL Pursuant to an Investor Rights Agreement dated as of March 16, 2006, we have granted Patriarch Partners and certain holders of our common shares customary registration rights, including demand and piggyback registration rights and Form F-3 registration rights. A total of 15,585,254 common shares of our company are covered by registration rights, assuming all of the outstanding preferred shares are converted, there are no accrued and unpaid dividends and the conversion price is not adjusted. The number of shares covered by registration rights may increase if Patriarch Partners owns more of our shares, for instance, if it converts the loan under the credit agreement described below into common shares. In addition, the investor rights agreement grants Patriarch Partners preemptive rights with respect to any issuance of equity securities issued by us, which provision was terminated upon the completion of our initial public offering. In the event XFL decides to transfer some of its securities in us, it must give rights of co-sale to Patriarch Partners, so that Patriarch Partners may sell securities along with XFL in the sale. 2008 convertible loan facility agreement among us, Zohar CDO 2003-1, Limited and Zohar II 2005-1, Limited, together with Patriarch Partners Agency Services LLC On October 21, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement with Zohar CDO 2003-1, Limited and Zohar II 2005-1, Limited, as lenders, together with Patriarch Partners Agency Services, LLC, as agent for the lenders. Each of the lenders and the agent are affiliates of Patriarch Partners. The facility is for a term of four years and is secured by a pledge of our television assets. The amount outstanding under the loan facility was convertible into our common shares at an initial conversion price of $1.12 per common share for the period from October 21, 2009 to October 20, 2010. The conversion price was initially increased to $1.37 per common share for the period from October 21, 2010 to October 20, 2011 and initially to $1.62 per common share for the period after October 21, 2012. We also granted certain registration rights, pre-emptive rights and tag-along rights to the lenders. As of the date of this annual report, the outstanding principal amount under the secured convertible loan facility is $41.5 million. In addition, we obtained a term loan of $7.6 million from Patriarch. We did not meet certain financial covenants contained in the secured convertible loan facility for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, for which we received a waiver. We also did not meet these financial covenants for the quarters ended December 31, 2009, March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010. We entered into an amendment and waiver to the secured convertible loan facility on July 12, 2010, which effectively waives our breach of financial covenants for the quarters ended December 31, 2009, March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010 and up to the date of the amendment, and lowers the financial covenants pertaining to minimum consolidated EBITDA, minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio, in each case on a prospective basis. 106 Table of Contents In connection with the amendment to the secured convertible loan facility, (i) we designated and issued 78,295 Series C convertible preferred shares to the lenders, convertible into 25% of our fully diluted common equity, (ii) we repaid $16.3 million of the convertible loan balance of which $8.7 million was repaid from the proceeds of the sale of our printing business and the remaining $7.6 million was repaid through an additional non-convertible term-loan of $7.6 million from the lenders. The amendment, among others, required us to grant the lenders additional security in our assets as collateral, required each of our offshore subsidiaries to guarantee our obligations under the secured convertible loan facility (including the additional non-convertible term loan) and requires us to make mandatory prepayments upon the occurrence of any debt or equity offering or asset sales by us or any of our subsidiaries. The approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series C convertible preferred shares is required for certain matters, such as authorizing the issuance of any Series C parity shares, while the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series C convertible preferred shares and any outstanding Series C parity shares is required for certain other matters, such as entering into certain transactions with shareholders or affiliates, or materially changing the scope of our business. Upon any liquidation, the Series C convertible preferred shares would be entitled to a liquidation preference. The holders of the Series C convertible preferred shares have the right to require that their shares be redeemed by us upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change of control of our company, any substantial asset sales or our receipt of any tender offer, exchange offer or repurchase offer for more than 50% of our outstanding common shares. The Series C convertible preferred shares are a newly-created series having certain preferences, limitations and relative rights. Subject to limitations on conversion in certain circumstances, at the option of the holders, the Series C convertible preferred shares can be converted into 104,854,627 common shares at any time. The conversion rate at any time shall be determined by dividing (x) the stated value per share, which is $100.00 per Series C convertible preferred share, subject to adjustment in the event of any subdivision or combination of the outstanding convertible preferred shares by (y) the then applicable conversion price, initially equal to $0.0747 per share, but subject to adjustment. The Series C convertible preferred shares are non-voting and, with respect to distribution and any liquidation or dissolution of our company, rank junior to the Series B convertible preferred shares. Transactions with Yucaipa Share purchase agreement between us and Yucaipa Yucaipa Global Partnership Fund L.P. and its affiliates, or Yucaipa, held 4.3% of our equity interests as of May 31, 2010. Yucaipa also holds 352,512 of our Series B convertible preferred shares, 300,000 of which were purchased for $30.0 million pursuant to a share purchase agreement entered into on February 18, 2008 and the remainder as in-kind dividends pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement. These Series B convertible preferred shares can be converted to 14,684,023 common shares at any time. The purchase price was determined through our arms-length transaction with Yucaipa. The Series B convertible preferred shares have certain preferences, limitations and relative rights. The Series B convertible preferred shares are convertible into common shares at the option of holders based on a conversion formula at any time after the first anniversary of the closing of the placement on February 28, 2008, or upon the occurrence of certain other events. The conversion rate at any time shall be determined by dividing an amount equal to the sum of (x) the stated value per share, which is $100.00 per convertible preferred share subject to adjustment in the event of any subdivision or combination of the outstanding preferred shares, plus (y) the amount of any accrued dividends per share then remaining unpaid on each convertible preferred share being converted by the then applicable conversion price, initially equal to $3.00 per share, but subject to adjustment. Yucaipa, as a holder of our Series B convertible preferred shares, is entitled to vote on an as converted basis together with the holders of our common shares. Moreover, the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series B convertible preferred shares is required for certain matters, such as authorizing the issuance of any parity shares, while the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series B convertible preferred shares and any outstanding parity shares is required for certain other matters, such as entering into certain transactions with shareholders or affiliates, or materially changing the scope of our business.

Upon any liquidation, the Series B convertible preferred shares would be entitled to a liquidation preference. The holders of the Series B convertible preferred shares have the right to require that their shares be redeemed by us upon the occurrence of certain events. 107 Table of Contents Shareholders agreement among us, Yucaipa and XFL The shareholders agreement requires XFL to vote its shares in us and take certain other actions to ensure that an individual designated by Yucaipa will remain one of our directors so long as Yucaipa continues to hold at least 50% of the Series B convertible preferred shares originally issued under the share purchase agreement. The shareholders agreement also provides Yucaipa with certain tag-along rights in connection with certain sales by Xinhua Finance Limited of common shares it holds in us. Registration rights agreement between us and Yucaipa Pursuant to a registration rights agreement dated February 28, 2008, we have granted Yucaipa piggyback registration rights. A total of 10,000,000 common shares of our company are covered by registration rights, assuming all of the outstanding Series B convertible preferred shares are converted, there are no accrued and unpaid dividends and the conversion price is not adjusted. Transactions with Hunan Television & Broadcast Intermediary Co., Ltd. Long Qiu Yun has served as our independent director since March 2007 and as a director of our subsidiary, Beijing Perspective Orient, from July 2006 to October 2007. Mr. Long also has served as the Board Chairman and General Manager of Hunan Television & Broadcast Intermediary Co., Ltd., or Hunan Television, since 1995. In July 2006, we acquired 51% of the equity of Beijing Perspective Orient from Hunan Television through Beijing Century Media, an affiliated entity. Xinhua Financial Network financed the purchase price for this acquisition. In October, 2007, we acquired, through Beijing Century Media, the remaining 49% of the equity of Beijing Perspective Orient for RMB 16.0 million ($2.3 million). In connection with the acquisition of the remaining 49% equity interest in Beijing Perspective Orient, we entered into a share subscription agreement and deed of non-competition undertaking and release with Whole Fortune Limited, or Whole Fortune, a limited liability company controlled by Hunan Television and incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Pursuant to these agreements, we issued 2,043,347 common shares to Whole Fortune in exchange for its entering into a non-competition agreement with us. Under the non-competition agreement, Whole Fortune promised that it and its affiliates will not compete with us or our affiliates outside of China for a term of four years. The common shares we issued to Whole Fortune were valued at $4.06 per share and had an aggregate value of $8.3 million. The terms of this non-competition agreement, including the price paid by us, when taken as a whole with the acquisition of 49% of the equity interest in Beijing Perspective Orient by Beijing Century Media, were determined on an arms length basis, and we believe the terms are comparable to terms we could obtain from independent third parties. See Item 5.A. Operating and financial review and prospects  Operating Results  Acquisitions. Share restructuring On September 22, 2006, we issued 4,099,968 warrants and 6,478,437 common shares and XFL paid $9.1 million to Sino Investment Holdings Limited the 37.0% shareholder of our subsidiary Upper Step Holdings, and the 61.0% shareholder of Accord Group Investments Limited, another subsidiary of ours, in exchange for its shareholdings in Upper Step Holdings, and 451,107 common shares in exchange for its shareholdings in Accord Group Investments Limited. The warrants are exercisable at an initial price of $3.659 per share. In addition, Sino Investment issued a demand promissory note to us in the amount of $7.9 million as part of this transaction, which has no specified interest rate. The warrants are immediately exercisable and valid for a period of five years. On August 7, 2007, the terms of the promissory note were amended so that the amount is repayable on or prior to November 9, 2011 and an 8.0% interest was applied to the promissory note.

Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information We have appended consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report. Legal Proceedings In October 2007, we purchased from UBS Financial Services, Inc. a $25.0 million principal protected note issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., or Lehman Brothers, linked to the FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index, which matured in January 2009. In July 2008, we borrowed $14.0 million from UBS AG using the principal protected note as collateral. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, and, after we refused to post additional collateral for the loan, UBS AG filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association against us seeking repayment of the loan on September 25, 2008. On October 28, 2008, we filed our defense to the demand as well as a cross claim against UBS Financial Services, Inc. for an amount in excess of $25.0 million. We took full provision of $24.9 million against the principal protection note as of December 31, 2008. On October 1, 2009, we settled this dispute with UBS Financial Services and UBS AG. Dividend Policy We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common shares, nor do we have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ADSs in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain most of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business. We have, however, paid dividends to the holder of our series A convertible preferred shares of approximately $1.3 million, $0.0 million and $0.0 million for the years ended December 31 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. We discontinued these dividends upon conversion of the series A convertible preferred shares. The terms of the 2008 credit agreement preclude us from paying any dividends on our common shares. Holders of our series B convertible preferred shares are entitled to dividends at 8.0% per annum of the stated value of such series B convertible preferred shares, payable at each fiscal quarter in cash or stock at our option. We have issued an aggregate of 52,512 Series B convertible preferred shares as dividends to the holder of such shares as of the date of this annual report. As we are a holding company, we rely on dividends paid to us by our wholly-owned subsidiaries Upper Step Holdings Limited, Accord Group Investments Limited, XFA, Profitown Group, East Alliance Limited and Small World Television, all of which are British Virgin Islands business companies, by our wholly-owned subsidiaries EconWorld Media, Singshine Marketing and Xinhua Finance Media (Hong Kong) Limited, all of which are Hong Kong companies, and by our indirect subsidiary Xinhua Media Entertainment in which we hold a 75% interest, a Cayman Islands company, for our cash requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, service any debt we may incur and pay our operating expenses. 109 Table of Contents In the British Virgin Islands, the payment of dividends is subject to limitations. A British Virgin Islands business company that prior to January 1, 2007 existed as an international business company is permitted to declare and pay dividends only out of surplus, meaning the excess, if any, at the time of the determination, of the total assets of the company over the sum of its total liabilities, as shown in the books of account, plus its capital. In addition, such company may not declare or pay a dividend unless the directors of the company determine that immediately after the payment of the dividend the company will be able to satisfy its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary course of its business and the realizable value of the assets of the company will not be less than the sum of its total liabilities, other than deferred taxes, as shown in the books of account, and its capital. In Hong Kong, the payment of dividends is also subject to limitations. Dividends may only be distributed out of accumulated, realized profits less accumulated, realized losses. Accumulated, realized profits must not have been previously distributed or capitalized. Accumulated, realized losses do not include those previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital. In the Cayman Islands, the payment of dividends is also subject to limitations. Dividends may only be distributed out of profits, or out of a companys share premium account, subject to the company being able to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If we are allowed to declare and pay dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. Cash dividends on our ADSs, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollars. Agreement with JCBN In 2007 we acquired a 100% equity interest in JCBN China, a leading advertising agent for Chinas online property and imported spirits sectors, and a 100% equity interest in Profitown Group, a below-the-line marketing services provider. The acquisition agreement required us to make an earnout payment to the former owner of JCBN in the amount of approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which remains outstanding as of the date of this annual report. We have no earnout obligations for the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, during our audit of JCBNs financial results for the year ended December 31, 2009, we identified two transactions for which the collectability of receivables was uncertain. We accounted for these transactions using the cash basis of accounting, and accordingly recorded no significant revenue for these transactions. In connection with our ongoing corporate restructuring, and due to the performance history of JCBN, we ceased operations of the JCBN businesses in 2010. We entered into a settlement agreement with the former owner of JCBN China and Profitown Group, collectively JCBN, in June 2010, pursuant to which we will pay the 2008 earnout amount by issuing shares in our company with an aggregate market value of approximately $2.4 million. We will issue these shares on December 28, 2010, and they will be subject to a six-month lockup period. In addition, we will transfer the entirety of our equity interest in JCBN back to the original selling shareholders. As consideration for this payment, the former owner of JCBN will agree to waive all claims against us for earnout payments. B.
