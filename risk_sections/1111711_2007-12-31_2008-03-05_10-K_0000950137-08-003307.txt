ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSources Whiting Clean Energy project has generated losses and may be sold at a substantial discount to the value of the facility on NiSources balance sheet. NiSource owns and operates a merchant energy facility, Whiting Clean Energy, at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery. This facility uses natural gas to generate electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and to generate steam for industrial use by BPs refinery. The profitability of this facility is dependant upon the market prices for electricity and natural gas and regional load dispatch patterns. On July 27, 2007, Whiting Clean Energy submitted a proposal in response to the Northern Indiana-issued RFP 2008 Combined Cycle Request for Proposals. Whiting Clean Energy was notified during October 2007 that its proposal to sell its facility was selected by Northern Indiana based on a purchase price of $210 million. However, on December 22, 2007, BP indicated it would exercise a contractual right of first refusal to purchase the Whiting Clean Energy facility. NiSource is in discussions with BP regarding several aspects of the offer. The carrying amount of the Whiting Clean Energy facility is approximately $270 million. ITEM 1B.
