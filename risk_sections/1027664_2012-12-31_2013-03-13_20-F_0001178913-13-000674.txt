Risk Factors – General Risks Related to Our Business and Market.) At December 31, 2012, we had outstanding buy-back obligations totaling approximately $748 million that extend through 2020. 57 Non-GAAP Financial Data The following non-GAAP financial data is presented to enable investors to have additional information on our business performance as well as a further basis for periodical comparisons and trends relating to our financial results. We believe such data provides useful information to investors by facilitating more meaningful comparisons of our financial results over time. Such non-GAAP information is used by our management to make strategic decisions, forecast future results and evaluate our current performance. However, investors are cautioned that, unlike financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, non-GAAP measures may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies. The non-GAAP financial data below includes reconciliation adjustments regarding non-GAAP gross profit, operating income, net income and diluted EPS. In arriving at non-GAAP presentations, companies generally factor out items such as those that have a non-recurring impact on the income statements, various non-cash items, significant effects of retroactive tax legislation and changes in accounting guidance and other items which, in management’s judgment, are items that are considered to be outside the review of core operating results. In our non-GAAP presentation below, we made the following adjustments to our GAAP net income: (1) added back amortization of purchased intangible assets; (2) added back significant reorganization, restructuring and other related expenses; (3) added back impairment of investments, including impairment of ARS; (4) subtracted gain from changes in holdings, including revaluation of the previously held shares at the acquisition date when a business combination is achieved in stages (step-up); (5) added back impairment loss from discontinued operations; (6) excluded the impact of the cessation of a program with a foreign customer; and (7) excluded the income tax effects of the foregoing. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 58 Reconciliation of GAAP (Audited) to Non-GAAP (Unaudited) Supplemental Financial Data (U.S. dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 GAAP gross profit 815.9 732.0 797.9 Adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets 24.2 30.9 25.0 Cessation of program(1) – 72.8 – Reorganization, restructuring and other related expenses(2) – – 12.8 Non-GAAP gross profit 840.1 835.7 835.7 Percent of revenues 29.1 % 29.7 % 31.3 % GAAP operating income 203.1 115.7 207.4 Adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets 49.3 57.3 47.7 Cessation of program(1) – 72.8 – Reorganization, restructuring and other related expenses(2) – – 16.4 Impairment of investments(3) – – 1.3 Gain from changes in holdings(4) – – (4.8 ) Non-GAAP operating income 252.3 245.8 268.0 Percent of revenues 8.7 % 8.7 % 10.0 % GAAP net income attributable to Elbit Systems’ shareholders 167.9 90.3 183.5 Adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets 49.3 57.3 47.7 Cessation of program(1) – 72.8 – Reorganization, restructuring and other related expenses(2) – 16.4 Impairment of investments(3) – 0.5 1.3 Gain from changes in holdings(4) (2.3 ) – (17.6 ) Adjustment of loss (gain) from discontinued operations, net(5) 0.4 9.4 (0.5 ) Related tax benefits (8.9 ) (23.7 ) (8.9 ) Non-GAAP net income attributable to Elbit Systems’ shareholders 206.3 206.6 221.9 Percent of revenues 7.1 % 7.3 % 8.3 % Non-GAAP diluted net EPS 4.9 4.8 5.1 (1) Adjustment of expenses related to cessation of a program, which resulted in write-off of inventories and other related costs. (2) Adjustment of reorganization, restructuring and other related expenses in 2010 were mainly due to write-off of inventories in the amount of approximately $13 million related to the acquisitions of Soltam and ITL.
