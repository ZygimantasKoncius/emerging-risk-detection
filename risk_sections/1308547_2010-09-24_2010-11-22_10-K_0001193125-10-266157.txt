ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We depend on the sale by our licensees of products that incorporate our technologies and a reduction in those sales would adversely affect our licensing revenue. We derive most of our revenue from the licensing of our technologies to digital entertainment product manufacturers. Licensing revenue represented 84%, 83%, and 77% of our total revenue in fiscal 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. We do not manufacture digital entertainment products ourselves and our licensing revenue is dependent on sales by our licensees of products that incorporate our technologies. We cannot control these manufacturers product development or commercialization efforts or predict their success. We also face the risk that our licensees have product channel inventory levels in excess of future anticipated sales. If such sales do not occur in the time frame anticipated by our licensee for any reason, these licensees may substantially decrease the amount of products they sell and therefore technologies they license from us in subsequent periods. In addition, our license agreements, which typically require manufacturers of digital entertainment products and software vendors to pay us a specified royalty for every electronics product shipped that incorporates our technologies, do not require these manufacturers to include our technologies in any specific number or percentage of units, and only a few of these agreements guarantee us a minimum aggregate licensing fee. Accordingly, if our licensees sell fewer products incorporating our technologies, or otherwise face significant economic difficulties, our revenue will decline. Moreover, we have a widespread presence in markets for electronics products, such as the Consumer Electronics (CE) product market, which includes DVD players, audio/video receivers, and other home theater CE products, and, as a result, there is little room for us to further penetrate such markets. Lower sales of products incorporating our technologies could occur for a number of reasons. Changes in consumer tastes or trends, rapidly evolving technology, changes in industry standards or adverse changes in business and economic conditions, may adversely affect our licensing revenue. Increasing market saturation, durability of products in the marketplace, competing products, and alternate consumer entertainment options could adversely affect demand for new products incorporating our technologies. To the extent that sales of PCs with Dolby technologies decline, our licensing revenue will be adversely affected. Over the last several years, PC manufacturers frequently included DVD playback functionality, which included Dolby technologies, as part of the software applications included in their products. Initially, DVD playback functionality was included in software licensed by independent software vendors, or ISVs. Starting in our fiscal 2007, Microsoft introduced its Windows Vista operating system, which included DVD playback functionality in two of its six editions. Even though those editions of Microsofts Windows Vista operating system included DVD playback, many major PC manufacturers continued to include the additional ISV DVD software applications. Windows 7, Microsofts newest operating system, became available in October 2009. Windows 7 includes DVD playback in four of its six available editions, including the Professional and Enterprise editions aimed at business customers. There are risks and uncertainties associated with this opportunity. Due in part to Windows 7 DVD playback enhancements and pricing pressure, some PC manufacturers have excluded, and we expect others in the future will exclude, ISV DVD software applications on PCs that include Windows 7. Additionally, it is uncertain at what pace consumer and business customers will migrate from their current operating systems to the 15 Table of Contents Windows 7 operating system and what the adoption rate of the editions with Dolby technologies will be. In addition, consumers are increasingly purchasing lower priced PCs, particularly netbooks and tablets, which do not have Dolby technologies. Consumers may elect to purchase these lower priced PCs instead of computers with DVD playback functionality and Dolby technologies. Future shipments of PCs with Dolby technologies could also decline. If any of the foregoing occurs, our licensing revenue will be adversely affected. Macroeconomic conditions may reduce our revenue and harm our business. We continue to be cautious regarding future macroeconomic conditions and their potential for suppressed consumer demand in the markets in which we license our technologies and sell our products. Our business could be materially adversely affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions, because our technologies are incorporated into entertainment-oriented products, which are generally discretionary goods, such as DVD players, Blu-ray Disc players, PCs, digital televisions, mobile devices, set-top boxes, hometheatersinabox, camcorders, portable media devices, gaming systems, audio/video receivers, and in-car entertainment systems. The global economic environment has adversely affected consumer confidence, disposable income, and spending. While we cannot predict future macroeconomic conditions, these conditions may persist or worsen. Furthermore, deteriorating or continued weakness in economic conditions result in a greater likelihood that more of our licensees and customers will become delinquent on their obligations to us or be unable to pay, which in turn, could result in a higher level of write-offs, all of which would adversely affect our earnings. Moreover, deteriorating economic conditions and other factors may result in increased underreporting and non-reporting of royalty bearing revenue by our licensees as well as increased unauthorized use of our technologies, which would adversely affect our earnings. Our future success depends, in part, upon the growth of new and existing markets for our technologies and our ability to develop and adapt our technologies for those markets. If those markets do not grow or we are not able to develop successful products for them, our business prospects could be limited. The future growth of our licensing revenue will depend, in part, upon the growth of, and our successful participation in, new and existing markets for our technologies. For example, growth of our broadcast revenue is dependent upon continued global growth of digital television broadcasting and the adoption of our technologies into emerging digital broadcast standards. Another example is that our PC revenue is dependent upon the growth of the PC market and the continued adoption of our technologies into PC operating systems as well as the adoption of our technologies into emerging types of devices such as tablets. Our ability to penetrate new and existing markets for our technologies depends on increased consumer demand for products that contain our technologies, which may not occur. Some of these markets are ones in which we have not previously participated, and we may not be able to adapt adequately our business and our technologies to consumer demand. In addition, even when our technologies are adopted as industry standards for a particular market, such market may not fully develop. If new and existing markets for our technologies do not develop or consumer demand for products that contain our technologies does not grow, our business and prospects would be materially adversely affected. If we do not develop and deliver innovative technologies in response to industry and technology changes, our business could decline. The markets for our products and the markets for digital entertainment products using our licensed technologies are characterized by rapid change and technological evolution that can render our technologies and products obsolete or unmarketable. The process of developing new technologies is complex and uncertain. We will need to expend considerable resources on research and development, or acquisitions, in the future in order to design and deliver innovative entertainment products and technologies. Despite our efforts, we may not be able to develop, or acquire, and effectively market new products, technologies and services in a timely manner that competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace. For example, we cannot ensure that Dolby Axon or Dolby Volume, will address the needs of the marketplace, be effectively marketed or be successful technologies. 16 Table of Contents In addition, we may not correctly identify new or changing market trends at an early enough stage to capitalize on market opportunities. For example, while we view the continued advancements in online and mobile content delivery as an area of opportunity if we are not able to competitively address the needs of the changing online and mobile markets our ability to generate revenue from those markets would be limited while our revenue from DVD and Blu-ray Disc players could decline. At times such changes can be dramatic, such as the shift from VHS tapes to DVDs for consumer playback of movies in homes and elsewhere. Our future success depends to a great extent on our ability to develop, or acquire, and deliver innovative technologies in a timely manner that are widely adopted in response to changes in the entertainment industry and that are compatible with the technologies or products introduced by other entertainment industry participants. Sales of component DVD players have declined significantly and we expect them to decline further. To the extent that sales of component DVD players continue to decline or alternative technologies in which we do not participate replace DVDs or Blu-ray Disc as a dominant medium for consumer video entertainment, our licensing revenue will be adversely affected. In the past, growth in our revenue had been the result, in large part, of the rapid growth in sales of component DVD players incorporating our technologies. However, as the markets for DVD players have matured, sales of component DVD players generally have declined significantly and we expect future sales of component consumer DVD players generally to continue to decline. While revenue from Blu-ray Disc players offset component standard definition DVD player revenue declines in fiscal 2010, future revenue from Blu-ray Disc player may not offset future declines in revenue from standard definition DVD players. A shift in consumer content consumption from DVD and Blu-ray Disc to internet content consumption through connected televisions and set-top boxes, could result in declines in revenue from DVD and Blu-ray Disc players. Such declines would adversely affect our licensing revenue. In addition, if new technologies or distribution channels are developed that compete with or replace DVD and Blu-ray Disc players as dominant media for consumer video entertainment, we may not be able to develop complementary technologies for and generate revenue from those new technologies or distribution channels. Furthermore, new technologies or distribution channels may be less profitable for us than DVD and Blu-ray Disc players. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our operating results may fluctuate depending upon the timing of when we receive royalty reports from our licensees and of the satisfaction of our revenue recognition criteria. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate depending upon the timing of when we receive royalty reports from our licensees and of the satisfaction of our revenue recognition criteria. We recognize license revenue only after we receive royalty reports from our licensees regarding the shipment of their products that incorporate our technologies and after all other revenue recognition criteria are met. As a result, the timing of our revenue depends upon the timing of our receipt of those reports and when we cannot determine the creditworthiness of our customers, the receipt of cash. In addition, it is not uncommon for royalty reports to include positive or negative corrective or retroactive royalties that cover extended periods of time. Furthermore, there have been times in the past when we have recognized an unusually large amount of licensing revenue from a licensee in a given quarter because not all of our revenue recognition criteria were met in prior periods. This can result in a large amount of licensing revenue from a licensee being recorded in a given quarter that is not necessarily indicative of the amounts of licensing revenue to be received from that licensee in future quarters, thus causing fluctuations in our operating results. For example, in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we recognized a total of approximately $21.6 million in licensing revenue from three licensees related to royalties on shipments in prior periods. Moreover, there have been times in the past when we have not recognized large amounts of products and services revenue in a given quarter, or over several quarters, because not all of our revenue recognition criteria were met in prior periods. For example, in fiscal 2009, we recognized approximately $38.6 million of previously deferred digital cinema product revenue, including $25.1 million relating to products sold in years prior to fiscal 2009. 17 Table of Contents Inaccurate licensee royalty reporting and unauthorized use of our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our operating results. We generate revenue primarily from digital entertainment product manufacturers and software vendors who license our technologies and incorporate those technologies in their products. Our license agreements generally obligate our licensees to pay us a specified royalty for every product they ship that incorporates our technologies, and we rely on our licensees to accurately report their shipments. We calculate our license fees, prepare our financial reports, projections, and budgets, and direct our sales and product development efforts based on these reports we receive from our licensees. However, we have difficulty independently determining whether or not our licensees are reporting shipments accurately. Independently determining that our licensees have reported shipments accurately is particularly problematic with respect to software incorporating our technologies because software can be copied relatively easily and we do not have easy ways to determine how many copies have been made. Most of our license agreements permit us to audit our licensees records, but audits are generally expensive, time consuming, and potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationships with our licensees. In the past, licensees, particularly in emerging economies, such as China, have understated or failed to report the number of products incorporating our technologies that they shipped, and we have not been able to collect and recognize revenue to which we were entitled. We expect that we will continue to experience understatement and non-reporting of royalties by our licensees, which could adversely affect our operating results. Conversely, to the extent that our licensees overstate the number of products incorporating our technologies, or report the products under the wrong categories, corrections of prior reports could result in reductions of royalty revenue in subsequent periods. To the extent that our licensees more closely scrutinize their past or future licensing statements, we may receive more royalty statements that contain corrections of prior reports. We also have often experienced, and expect to continue to experience, problems with non-licensee digital entertainment product manufacturers and software vendors, particularly in emerging economies, such as China, incorporating our technologies or incorporating our technologies and trademarks into their products without our authorization and without paying us any licensing fees. This form of piracy is facilitated when manufacturers of ICs containing our technologies sell ICs with our technologies to third parties who are not our system licensees and not reporting these sales. As emerging economies transition from analog to digital content we expect to experience increased problems with this form of piracy. Increased unauthorized use of our intellectual property would adversely affect our operating results. If we do not expand our business into non-sound technologies, our future growth could be limited. Our future growth will depend, in part, upon our expansion into areas beyond sound technologies. For example, in addition to our digital cinema initiative, we are exploring other areas that facilitate delivery of digital entertainment, such as technologies for processing digital moving images. We will need to spend considerable resources on research and development or acquisitions in the future in order to deliver innovative non-sound technologies. However, we have limited experience in non-sound technology markets and, despite our efforts, we cannot predict whether we will be successful in developing, or acquiring, and marketing non-sound products, technologies, and services. We will face significant risks in integrating non-sound businesses that we acquire into our business. In addition, many of the non-sound technology markets which we are targeting are relatively new and may not develop as we currently anticipate. Moreover, although we believe that many of the technological advances we may develop or acquire for digital cinema and 3D digital cinema may have applicability in other areas, such as 3D for broadcasting or CE products, we may not be able to achieve these anticipated benefits in these other markets. A number of competitors and potential competitors may develop non-sound technologies similar to those that we develop or acquire, some of which may provide advantages over our products, technologies, and services. Some of these competitors have much greater experience and expertise than we do in the non-sound fields we may enter. The non-sound products, technologies, and services we expect to market may not achieve or sustain market acceptance, may not meet industry needs, and may not be accepted as industry standards. If we are 18 Table of Contents unsuccessful in selling non-sound products, technologies, and services, the future growth of our business may be limited. In addition, our efforts to enter or strengthen our positions in non-sound markets may be tied to the success of specific programs. If our products and technologies are not adopted as industry standards, our business prospects could be limited and our operating results could be adversely affected. The entertainment industry depends upon industry standards to ensure the compatibility of its content across a wide variety of entertainment systems and products. Accordingly, we make significant efforts to design our products and technologies to address capability, quality, and cost considerations so that they either meet, or, more importantly, are adopted as, industry standards across the broad range of entertainment industry markets in which we participate, as well as the markets in which we hope to compete in the future. To have our products and technologies adopted as industry standards, we must convince a broad spectrum of professional organizations throughout the world, as well as our major customers and licensees who are members of such organizations, to adopt them as such and to ensure that other industry standards are consistent with our products and technologies. If our technologies are not adopted or do not remain as industry standards, our business, operating results, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We expect that meeting, maintaining, and establishing industry standard technologies will be critical to our business in the future. In addition, the market for broadcast technologies has traditionally been heavily based upon industry standards, often set by governments or other regulatory bodies, and we expect this to be the case in the future. If our technologies are not chosen as industry standards for broadcasting in particular geographic areas, this could adversely affect our ability to compete in these markets. It may be more difficult for us, in the future, to have our technologies adopted as individual industry standards to the extent that entertainment industry participants collaborate on the development of industry standard technologies. Increasingly, standards-setting organizations are adopting or establishing technology standards for use in a wide range of digital entertainment products. As a result, it is more difficult for individual companies to have their technologies adopted wholesale as an informal industry standard. We call this type of standard a de facto industry standard, meaning that the standard is not explicitly mandated by any industry standards-setting body but is nonetheless widely adopted. In addition, increasingly there are a large number of companies, including ones that typically compete against one another, involved in the development of new technologies for use in consumer entertainment products. As a result, these companies often license their collective intellectual property rights as a group, making it more difficult for any single company to have its technologies adopted widely as a de facto industry standard or to have its technologies adopted as an exclusive, explicit industry standard for digital entertainment products. Even if our technologies are adopted as an industry standard for a particular market, market participants may not widely adopt our technologies. Even when a standards-setting body mandates our technologies for a particular market, which we call an explicit industry standard, our technologies may not be the sole technologies adopted for that market as an industry standard. Accordingly, our operating results depend upon participants in that market choosing to adopt our technologies instead of competitive technologies that also may be acceptable under such standard. For example, the continued growth of our revenue from the broadcast market will depend upon both the continued global adoption of digital television generally and the choice to use our technologies where it is an optional industry standard. The licensing of patents constitutes a significant source of our revenue. If we do not replace expiring patents with new patents or proprietary technologies, our revenue could decline. We hold patents covering much of the technologies that we license to system licensees, and our licensing revenue is tied in large part to the life of those patents. Our right to receive royalties related to our patents 19 Table of Contents terminates with the expiration of the last patent covering the relevant technologies in a particular country. Accordingly, to the extent that we do not replace licensing revenue from technologies covered by expiring patents with licensing revenue based on new patents and proprietary technologies, our revenue could decline. As of September 24, 2010, we had nearly 1,900 individual issued patents and over 2,050 pending patent applications in nearly 45 jurisdictions throughout the world. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through July 2029. Of these, one patent is scheduled to expire in the remainder of calendar year 2010, 34 patents are scheduled to expire in calendar year 2011, 52 patents are scheduled to expire in calendar year 2012, and 31 patents are scheduled to expire in calendar year 2013. We derive our licensing revenue principally from our Dolby Digital technologies. Patents relating to our Dolby Digital technologies have begun to expire and the remaining patents relating to this technology generally expire between now and 2017, and additional patents relating to our Dolby Digital Plus technologies, an extension of Dolby Digital, expire between 2018 and 2026. In addition, the remaining patents relating to Dolby Digital Live technologies, an extension of Dolby Digital, are scheduled to expire in 2021. We face significant competition in various markets, and if we are unable to compete successfully, our business will suffer. The markets for entertainment industry technologies are highly competitive, and we face competitive threats and pricing pressure in our markets. Competitors for our licensed technologies include: Audyssey Laboratories, DTS, Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits, Microsoft, Philips, RealNetworks, Sonic Solutions, Sony, SRS Labs, and Thomson. Competitors for our products include: Barco, Doremi, GDC, IMAX, MasterImage 3D, NEC, Panavision, QSC Audio Products, Qube Cinema, REALD, Sony, Technicolor, Texas Instruments, USL, and XpanD. In addition, other companies, including exhibitors and film studios, may develop their own 3D or digital cinema technologies in the future. Competitors for our services include DTS and Sony. In addition, other companies may become competitors in the future. Consumers may perceive the quality of the audio experience produced by some of our competitors technologies to be equivalent or superior to the audio experience produced by our technologies. In addition, some of our current and/or future competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do, or may have more experience or advantages in the markets in which they compete. For example, some of our current or potential competitors may have an advantage over us in the market for online content because of their greater experience and presence in that market. In addition, some of our current or potential competitors may be able to offer integrated system solutions in markets for sound or non-sound entertainment technologies, including audio, video, and rights management technologies related to PCs or the internet, which could make competing technologies that we develop unnecessary. By offering an integrated system solution, these potential competitors also may be able to offer competing technologies at lower prices than our technologies, which could adversely affect our operating results. Further, many of the digital entertainment products that include our sound technologies also include sound technologies developed by our competitors. Several competitors have introduced digital cinema products which support the presentation of movies with higher resolution 4K digital cinema projectors. Dolby currently does not offer a 4K digital cinema product. As a result, we must invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our technologies and our existing products and services and introduce new high quality technologies, products, and services to meet the wide variety of such competitive pressures. Our business will suffer if we fail to do so successfully. Our business and prospects depend on the strength of our brand, and if we do not maintain and strengthen our brand, our business will be materially harmed. Maintaining and strengthening the Dolby brand is critical to maintaining and expanding our licensing, products, and services, as well as to our ability to enter new markets for our sound and other technologies. Our continued success depends, in part, on our reputation for providing high quality products, services, and technologies across a wide range of entertainment industries, including the CE products, PC, broadcast and gaming industries. If we fail to promote and maintain the Dolby brand successfully in licensing, products or services, our business and prospects will suffer. Moreover, we believe that the likelihood that our technologies 20 Table of Contents will be adopted as industry standards in various markets and for various applications depends, in part, upon the strength of our brand, because professional organizations and industry participants are more likely to accept, as an industry standard, technologies developed by a well-respected and well-known brand. Our ability to maintain and strengthen our brand will depend heavily on our ability to develop innovative technologies for the entertainment industry, to successfully enter into new markets, and to provide high quality products and services, which we may not do successfully. Establishing brand recognition is particularly challenging in newer markets in which we have limited experience. Our licensing of industry standard technologies can be subject to limitations that could adversely affect our business and prospects. When a standards-setting body mandates our technologies as explicit industry standards, we generally must agree to license such technologies on a fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory basis, which could limit our control over the use of these technologies. In these situations, we must often limit the royalty rates we charge for these technologies, which could adversely affect our revenue. Furthermore, we may be unable to limit to whom we license such technologies, and may be unable to restrict many terms of the license. From time to time we may be subject to claims that our licenses of our industry standard technologies may not conform to the requirements of the standards-setting body. Private parties have raised this type of issue with us in the past. Allegations such as these could be asserted in private actions seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief, or in regulatory actions. Claimants in such cases could seek to restrict or change our licensing practices or our ability to license our technologies in ways that could injure our reputation and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and prospects. We face risks in conducting business in emerging economies, such as China, particularly due to the limited recognition and enforcement of intellectual property and contractual rights in these countries. We believe that various trends will increase our exposure to the risks of conducting business in emerging economies. For example, we expect digital entertainment product manufacturing in emerging economies, such as China, to increase due to the availability of lower manufacturing costs as compared to those of other industrial countries and the continued industry shift by discount retailers towards lower end DVD and more recently Blu-ray Disc player offerings. We also believe that our sales of products and services in emerging economies will expand in the future to the extent that the use of digital surround sound technologies increases in these countries, including in movies and broadcast television. We further expect that the sale of products incorporating our technologies will increase in emerging economies to the extent that consumers there become more affluent. We face many risks associated with operating in these emerging economies, in large part due to limited recognition and enforcement of contractual and intellectual property rights. As a result, we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights in these emerging economies, where intellectual property rights are not as respected as they are in the United States, Japan, and Europe. We believe that it is critical that we strengthen existing relationships and develop new relationships with entertainment industry participants worldwide to increase our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights without relying solely on the legal systems in the countries in which we operate. If we are unable to develop, maintain, and strengthen these relationships, our revenue from these countries could be adversely affected. Our licensing revenue depends in large part upon semiconductor manufacturers incorporating our technologies into integrated circuits, or ICs, for sale to our system licensees and if, for any reason, our technologies are not incorporated in these ICs or fewer ICs are sold that incorporate our technologies, our operating results would be adversely affected. Our licensing revenue from system licensees depends in large part upon the availability of integrated circuits, or ICs, that implement our technologies. IC manufacturers incorporate our technologies into these ICs, which are then incorporated in digital entertainment products. We do not manufacture these ICs, but rather depend on IC manufacturers to develop, produce, and then sell them to system licensees. We do not control the 21 Table of Contents IC manufacturers decisions whether or not to incorporate our technologies into their ICs, and we do not control their product development or commercialization efforts nor predict their success. As a result, if these IC manufacturers are unable or unwilling, for any reason, to implement our technologies into their ICs, or if, for any reason, they sell fewer ICs incorporating our technologies, our operating results will be adversely affected. Furthermore, we rely on IC manufacturers to report to us the number of ICs sold that incorporate our technologies so that we can track the accuracy of system licensee reporting. IC manufacturers have sold ICs with our technologies to third parties that are not system licensees, resulting in lost revenue. Pricing pressures on the system licensees who incorporate our technologies into their products could limit the licensing fees we charge for our technologies, which could adversely affect our revenue. The markets for the digital entertainment products in which our technologies are incorporated are intensely competitive and price sensitive. Retail prices for digital entertainment products that include our sound technologies, such as DVD players and home theater systems, have decreased significantly, and we expect prices to decrease for the foreseeable future. In response, manufacturers have sought to reduce their product costs, which can result in downward pressure on the licensing fees we charge our customers who incorporate our technologies into the digital entertainment products that they sell. Further, while we have contractual rights with many of our licensees for cost of living adjustments to our royalty rights, we may not be able to negotiate those terms in our contracts with existing and new licensees. Moreover, downward cost of living adjustments would result in declines in the licensing fees that we charge. A decline in, or the modification or loss of the contractual right to increase, the licensing fees we charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We have in the past, and may in the future be, subject to legal claims related to our intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages, and could limit our ability to use particular technologies in the future. Companies in the technology and entertainment industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have faced such claims in the past and we expect to face similar claims in the future. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and could divert management resources and attention. In the past we have settled claims relating to infringement allegations and agreed to make payments in connection with such settlements. We expect that similar claims will be asserted against us in the future in the ordinary course of our business. An adverse determination in any intellectual property claim could require that we pay damages or stop using technologies found to be in violation of a third partys rights and could prevent us from offering our products and services to others. In order to avoid these restrictions, we may have to seek a license for the technology. This license may not be available on reasonable terms, could require us to pay significant royalties, and may significantly increase our operating expenses. The technologies also may not be available for license to us at all. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technologies, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technologies for any aspects of our business found to be infringing, we may be forced to limit our product and service offerings and may be unable to compete effectively. In some instances, we have contractually agreed to provide indemnifications to licensees relating to our intellectual property. In addition, at times in the past, we have chosen to defend our licensees from third party intellectual property infringement claims even where such defense was not contractually required, and we may choose to take on such defense in the future. Any of these results could harm our brand, our operating results, and our financial condition. In addition, from time to time we are engaged in disputes regarding the licensing of our intellectual property rights, including matters related to our royalty rates and other terms of our licensing arrangements. These types of disputes can be asserted by our customers or prospective customers or by other third parties as part of negotiations with us or in private actions seeking monetary damages or injunctive relief, or in regulatory actions. In the past, licensees have threatened to initiate litigation against us regarding our licensing royalty rate practices including our adherence to 22 Table of Contents licensing on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms and potential antitrust claims. Damages and requests for injunctive relief asserted in claims like these could be material, and could have a significant impact on our business. Any disputes with our customers or potential customers or other third parties could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects. We face many risks related to the emerging 3D cinema market. We face many risks in the 3D cinema market which may affect our ability to successfully participate in that market, including, but not limited to the following:  Our participation in the 3D cinema market will be limited to the extent theaters do not convert from analog to digital cinema.  Demand for our 3D cinema products is driven by the number of 3D cinema releases and the commercial success of those releases.  Industry participants may perceive our reusable glasses business model as less easy to manage.  We may pursue other 3D business models that could be less successful or less profitable.  Our 3D glasses could become subject to regulation in the U.S. and other countries in the future. Such regulations potentially could restrict how our 3D glasses are manufactured, used or marketed, which would adversely affect our ability to participate in the 3D market.  There has been increased public scrutiny of potential health risks relating to viewing 3D movies. Some third parties suggest viewing 3D movies could cause health risks. If these potential health risks are substantiated, the popularity of 3D movies could decline. In addition, if health risks associated with our 3D products materialize, we may become subject to government regulation or product liability claims, including personal injury claims.  At least one of our competitors has exclusive licensing arrangements for 3D products with theater exhibitors, which has in the past and we expect will in the future restrict our ability to compete in the 3D market. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, our ability to compete profitably in the 3D cinema market may be adversely affected. Our inability to deploy our digital cinema servers in significant numbers in the transition to digital cinema, coupled with the price of our products, could limit our future prospects in the digital cinema market and could materially and adversely affect our business. A small percentage of theaters have adopted digital cinema for the distribution and exhibition of movies. A number of companies offer competing products for digital cinema that exhibitors may perceive to be potentially advantageous to our products. Some of these competing products are priced lower than our products or offer features, such as support for 4K presentation. At least one competitor has a significantly greater installed base of its competing digital cinema playback servers than we do and another competitor has a significantly greater installed base of its competing 3D products than we do, either of which could limit our eventual share of the digital cinema market and materially and adversely affect our operating results. As the market for digital cinema has grown, we have faced more pricing and other competitive pressures than we have historically experienced for our traditional cinema products. As a result, we have implemented and may have to continue to implement pricing strategies which will have an adverse impact on our products gross margins in the future. If funding for the broader adoption of digital cinema is not available or if the market for digital cinema develops more slowly than expected, our future prospects could be limited and our business could be materially and adversely affected. At present only a small percentage of movie theaters have been converted to digital cinema, and we expect the broad conversion of theaters to digital cinema technologies, if it occurs, to be a multi year process due to financial 23 Table of Contents obstacles. Until recently, macroeconomic conditions have limited the availability of funding for cinema rollouts. Although in March 2010 certain major exhibitors announced the availability of financing for digital cinema upgrades in U.S. theaters, those exhibitors may not receive funding for further upgrades and other exhibitors may not receive funding at all. If funding is not available on favorable terms or at all, the broader adoption of digital cinema could be delayed further. Further, we cannot predict how quickly digital cinema will become widely adopted. If the demand for digital cinema equipment develops more slowly than expected the broad adoption of digital cinema will continue to be delayed which could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisition activities could result in operating difficulties, dilution to our stockholders and other harmful consequences. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of possible strategic transactions, including acquisitions. We consider these types of transactions in connection with our efforts to expand our business beyond sound technologies to other technologies related to the delivery of digital entertainment. Although we cannot predict whether or not we will complete any such acquisition or other transactions in the future, any of these transactions could be material in relation to our market capitalization, financial condition or results of operations. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology may create unforeseen difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we may face risks in integrating acquired businesses include:  Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges;  Cultural and logistical challenges associated with integrating employees from acquired businesses into our organization;  Retaining employees from businesses we acquire;  The need to implement or improve internal controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at businesses that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures and policies;  Possible write-offs or impairment charges resulting from acquisitions;  Unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to acquired businesses; and  The need to integrate acquired businesses accounting, management information, manufacturing, human resources, and other administrative systems to permit effective management. Foreign acquisitions involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations across different geographies, cultures, and languages, currency risks, and risks associated with the particular economic, political, and regulatory environment in specific countries. Also, the anticipated benefit of our acquisitions may not materialize. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our operating results or financial condition. Future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Moreover, acquisitions may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, including a potential adverse impact on our gross margins. Changes to our enterprise resource planning and other key software applications could cause unexpected problems to occur and disrupt the management of our business. We recently replaced our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system as well as other key software applications used in our global operations. Our ERP system and related applications are integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records, manage royalty and product revenue streams, record our transactions, provide critical information to our management, and prepare our financial statements. Any unexpected difficulties resulting from these replacement efforts, could adversely affect our operating results and the accuracy and timely reporting of those results. 24 Table of Contents Third parties from whom we license technologies may challenge our calculation of the royalties we owe them for inclusion of their technologies in our products and licensed technologies, which could adversely affect our operating results, business, and prospects. In some cases, the products we sell and the technologies we license to our customers include intellectual property that we have licensed from third parties. Our agreements with these third parties generally require us to pay them royalties for that use, and give the third parties the right to audit our calculation of those royalties. A third party may disagree with our interpretation of the terms of a license agreement or, as a result of an audit, a third party could challenge the accuracy of our calculation. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, involved in disputes with third party technology licensors regarding license terms. A successful challenge by a third party could increase the amount of royalties we have to pay to the third party, decrease our gross margin, and adversely affect our operating results. Such a challenge could result in the termination of the license agreement which would impair our ability to continue to use and re-license intellectual property from that third party which, in turn, could adversely affect our business and prospects. Our relationships with entertainment industry participants are particularly important to our products, services, and technology licensing, and if we do not maintain such relationships our business could be materially harmed. If we fail to maintain and expand our relationships with a broad range of participants throughout the entertainment industry, including film studios, broadcasters, video game designers, music producers, mobile content producers, and manufacturers of digital entertainment products, our business and prospects could be materially harmed. Relationships have historically played an important role in the entertainment industries that we serve. For example, sales of our products and services are particularly dependent upon our relationships with the major film studios and broadcasters, and licensing of our technologies is particularly dependent upon our relationships with system licensees, software vendors, and integrated circuit, or IC, manufacturers. If we fail to maintain and strengthen these relationships, these entertainment industry participants may be more likely not to purchase and use our products, services, and technologies, or create content incorporating our technologies, which could materially harm our business and prospects. In addition to directly providing substantially all of our revenue, these relationships are also critical to our ability to have our technologies adopted as industry standards. In addition, if major industry participants form strategic relationships that exclude us, whether in products, services, or licensing, our business and prospects could be materially adversely affected. We have limited or no patent protection for some of our technologies in particular countries, including China, Taiwan, and India, which could limit our ability to grow our business in these markets. We have a relatively limited number of issued patents in particular countries, including China, Taiwan, and India. For example, in China and Taiwan we have only limited patent protection, especially with respect to our Dolby Digital technologies. In India, we have no issued patents for Dolby Digital technologies. Consequently, maintaining or growing our licensing revenue in these emerging countries will depend on our ability to obtain patent rights in these countries for existing and new technologies, which is uncertain. Moreover, because of the limitations of the legal systems in many countries, the effectiveness of patents obtained or that may in the future be obtained, if any, is likewise uncertain. We face diverse risks in our international business, which could adversely affect our operating results. We are dependent on international sales for a substantial amount of our total revenue. For fiscal 2008, 2009, and 2010, revenue from outside the United States was 66%, 65%, and 66% of our total revenue, respectively. We expect that international and export sales will represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. This future revenue will depend to a large extent on the continued use and expansion of our technologies in entertainment industries worldwide. Increased worldwide use of our technologies is also an important factor in our future growth. 25 Table of Contents Due to our reliance on sales to customers outside the United States, we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally, including:  Our ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the United States, Japan, and European countries, which increases the risk of unauthorized, and uncompensated, use of our technologies;  United States and foreign government trade restrictions, including those which may impose restrictions on importation of programming, technology or components to or from the United States;  Our ability to comply with applicable international laws and regulations governing our business and operations, including local consumer and safety laws, as well as license requirements;  Foreign government taxes, regulations, and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the United States, and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the United States;  Burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws;  Changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;  Difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;  Adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including risks related to any interest rate swap or other hedging activities we undertake;  Political instability, natural disasters, war or events of terrorism; and  The strength of international economies. In addition, a significant number of our employees are located outside the United States. This means we have exposure to changes in foreign laws governing our relationships with our employees, which could have a direct impact on our operating costs. Expansion into international markets has required, and will require, significant management attention and resources. Moreover, local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the United States. We incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the United States. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by United States regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S. export controls. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S. export controls, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, distributors, dealers, and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or these regulations. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business. Revisions to patent laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad may adversely impact our ability to obtain, license and enforce our patent rights. Our licensing business depends in part on the uniform and consistent treatment of patent rights in the U.S. and abroad. Changes to the patent laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad may limit our ability to obtain, license, and enforce our rights. For example, in recent years the U.S. Congress has considered a number of changes to the patent laws including changes to the calculation of damages for patent infringement. In addition, court and administrative rulings may interpret existing patent laws and regulations in ways that adversely affect our ability to obtain, license, and enforce our patents. For example, in recent years the U.S. Supreme Court has issued rulings on the standard for determining whether an invention is obvious, which is a key issue when assessing patentability, the ability of a patent holder to obtain injunctive relief against infringers, and the ability of patent licensees to challenge the patents under which they are licensed. The ruling concerning injunctions may 26 Table of Contents make it more difficult, under some circumstances, for us to obtain injunctive relief against a party that has been found to infringe one or more of our patents, and the ruling regarding patent challenges by licensees could potentially make it easier for our licensees to challenge our patents even though they have already agreed to take a license. Our ability to develop proprietary technologies in markets in which open standards are adopted may be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. Standards-setting bodies, such as those for digital cinema technologies, may require the use of so-called open standards, meaning that the technologies necessary to meet those standards are publicly available. The use of open standards may reduce our opportunity to generate revenue, as open standards technologies are based upon non-proprietary technology platforms in which no one company maintains ownership over the dominant technologies. Events and conditions in the cinema and broadcast industries may affect sales of our cinema products and other services. Sales of our cinema products and services tend to fluctuate based on the underlying trends in the cinema industry. For example, when box office receipts for the cinema industry increase, we have typically seen sales of our cinema products increase as well, as cinema owners are more likely to build new theaters and upgrade existing theaters with our more advanced products when they are doing well financially. Conversely, when box office receipts are down cinema owners tend to scale back on plans to expand or upgrade their systems. Our cinema product sales are also subject to fluctuations based on events and conditions in the cinema exhibition industry generally that may or may not be tied to box office receipts in particular time periods. For example, the growth in piracy of motion pictures adversely affects the construction of new screens, the renovation of existing theaters, and the continued production of new motion pictures. Technological advances and the conversion of motion pictures from film to digital have made it easier to create, transmit, and share high quality unauthorized copies of motion pictures, including on pirated DVDs and on the internet. On the other hand, our services revenue, both in the United States and internationally, is tied to the number of films being made by major film studios and independent filmmakers. A number of factors can affect the number of films that are produced, including strikes and work stoppages within the cinema industry, as well as by the tax incentive arrangements that many foreign governments provide filmmakers to promote local filmmaking. The demand for our cinema products and services could decline as the film industry adopts digital cinema. Although only a small percentage of theaters have adopted digital cinema technologies for the distribution and exhibition of motion pictures, the number of cinema exhibitors adopting digital cinema for new theater construction or existing theater upgrades continues to grow. As exhibitors have constructed new theaters or upgraded existing theaters they have generally chosen digital cinema over traditional film cinema and we expect this trend to continue. Digital cinema, which is based on open standards, does not include our proprietary audio technologies. As the film industry continues to adopt digital cinema, the demand for our traditional cinema products and services has declined significantly and we anticipate that the demand for film based products will decline in future periods. Furthermore, exhibitors adopting digital cinema can choose from multiple digital cinema playback servers other than ours, none of which contain our technologies. A continued decrease in the demand for our traditional film cinema products and services that is not accompanied by a meaningful increase in revenue from digital cinema products and services would adversely affect our revenue stream from the cinema industry. In addition, a decrease in the demand for our products and services could adversely affect licensing of our consumer technologies, because the strength of our brand and our ability to use professional product developments to introduce new technologies, which can later be licensed to consumer product manufacturers and service providers, would be impaired. If, in such circumstances, we are unable to adapt our products and services or introduce new products for the digital cinema market successfully, our business could be materially adversely affected. 27 Table of Contents Our stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. In July 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved an additional $300.0 million for our stock repurchase program, whereby we may continue to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. This repurchase program may reduce the public float of shares available for trading on a daily basis. Depending on market conditions and other factors, such purchases may be limited, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. There can be no assurance that we will buy additional shares of our Class A common stock under our stock repurchase program or that any future repurchases will have a positive impact on our stock price or earnings per share. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue our share repurchases include, among others, unfavorable market conditions, the market price of our Class A common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time, our ability to make appropriate, timely, and beneficial decisions as to when, how, and whether to purchase shares under the stock repurchase program, and the availability of funds necessary to continue purchasing stock. If we curtail our repurchase program, our stock price may be negatively affected. Fluctuations in our operating results and other factors may contribute to the volatility of the market price of our stock. A number of factors, many of which are outside our control, may cause or contribute to significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results. These fluctuations may make financial planning and forecasting more difficult. In addition, these fluctuations may result in unanticipated decreases in our available cash, which could negatively impact our business and prospects. As described more fully below, these fluctuations also could increase the volatility of our stock price. In addition to the other factors discussed in this Risk Factors section, factors that may cause or contribute to fluctuations in our operating results and revenue or the volatility of the market price of our stock include:  Fluctuations in demand for our products and for the digital entertainment products of our licensees;  Adverse developments in general macroeconomic conditions;  The amount and timing of our operating costs, capital expenditures, and related charges, including those related to the expansion or consolidation of our business, operations, and infrastructure;  Changes in business cycles that affect the markets in which we sell our products and services or the markets for digital entertainment products incorporating our technologies;  Fluctuations in the timing of royalty reports we receive from our licensees, including late, sporadic or inaccurate reports;  Variations in the time-to-market of our technologies in the entertainment industries in which we operate;  Corrections to licensees reports received in periods subsequent to those in which the original revenue was reported;  The announcement, introduction or enhancement of products, services, and technologies by us, our licensees and our competitors, and market acceptance of these new or enhanced products, services, and technologies;  Rapid, wholesale changes in technology in the entertainment industries in which we compete;  Events and conditions in the cinema industry, including box office receipts that affect the number of theaters constructed, the number of movies produced and exhibited, the general popularity of motion pictures, and strikes by cinema industry participants;  The financial resources of cinema operators available to buy our products or to equip their theaters to accommodate upgraded or new technologies;  Consolidation by participants in the markets in which we compete, which could result among other things in pricing pressure; 28 Table of Contents  Seasonal electronics product shipment patterns by our system licensees, particularly in the first quarter, which generally result in revenue in the second quarter;  The impact of, and our ability to react to, interruptions in the entertainment distribution process, including as a result of work stoppages at our facilities, our customers facilities, and other points throughout the entertainment distribution process;  Adverse outcomes of litigation or governmental proceedings, including any foreign, federal, state or local tax assessments or audits;  Repurchases we make of our common stock;  Costs of litigation and intellectual property protection;  Exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and other currencies;  Variations between our operating results and published analysts expectations; and  Announcements by our competitors or significant customers. One or more of the foregoing or other factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately higher or lower or may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly in any particular quarterly or annual period. Such fluctuations in our operating expenses or financial performance could contribute to the volatility of the market price of our stock. Results from prior periods are thus not necessarily indicative of the results of future periods. Changes in tax rates and exposure for additional income tax liabilities or adverse outcomes resulting from examinations of our tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, the geographic mix of our revenue, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. We file income tax returns in the United States and in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. For example, our income taxes could be adversely affected by:  Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates;  Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;  Expiration of or lapses in the R&D tax credit laws;  Fluctuations in tax exempt interest income;  Transfer pricing adjustments;  Tax effects of nondeductible compensation;  Tax costs related to intercompany realignments;  Changes in accounting principles; or  Changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. In addition, we are subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance, however, that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, due 29 Table of Contents to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or if our operating results do not meet or exceed their projections, our stock price could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us or our industry downgrade our stock or the stock of other companies in our industry, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or industry, or if our operating results do not meet or exceed their projections, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. Any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand. Our business is dependent upon our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights. Licensing revenue represented 84%, 83%, and 77% of our total revenue in the fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. Effective intellectual property rights protection, however, may not be available under the laws of every country in which our products and services and those of our licensees are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. In addition, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. We have taken steps in the past to enforce our intellectual property rights and expect do so in the future. However, it may not be practicable or cost effective for us to enforce our intellectual property rights fully, particularly in some countries or where the initiation of a claim might harm our business relationships. For example, we have many times experienced, and expect to continue to experience, problems with digital entertainment product manufacturers incorporating our technologies into their products without our authorization and with implementation licensees selling ICs with our technologies to unlicensed digital entertainment product manufacturers that are not system licensees. If we are unable to successfully identify and stop unauthorized use of our intellectual property, we could experience increased operational and enforcement costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We generally seek patent protection for our innovations. However, it is possible that some of these innovations may not be protectable. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect particular innovations that later turn out to be important. Moreover, we have limited or no patent protection in particular foreign jurisdictions. For example, in China and Taiwan we have only limited patent protection, especially with respect to our Dolby Digital technologies, and in India we have no issued patents. Even where we do have patent protection, the scope of such protection may be insufficient to prevent third parties from designing around our particular patent claims. Furthermore, there is always the possibility that an issued patent may later be found to be invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, we seek to maintain select intellectual property as trade secrets. These trade secrets could be compromised by third parties, or intentionally or accidentally by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from them. Some of our customers are also our current or potential competitors, and if those customers were to choose to use their competing technologies rather than ours, our business and operating results would be adversely affected. We face competitive risks in situations where our customers are also current or potential competitors. For example, Sony and Microsoft are significant licensee customers and Sony is a significant purchaser of our broadcast products and services, but Sony and Microsoft are also competitors with respect to some of our 30 Table of Contents consumer, broadcast, and cinema technologies. To the extent that our customers choose to utilize competing technologies they have developed or in which they have an interest, rather than use our technologies, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Surround sound technologies could be treated as a commodity in the future, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and prospects. We believe that the success we have had licensing our surround sound technologies to system licensees is due, in part, to the strength of our brand and the perception that our technologies provide a high quality solution for surround sound. However, as applications that incorporate surround sound technologies become increasingly prevalent, we expect more competitors to enter this field with other solutions. Furthermore, to the extent that competitors solutions are perceived, accurately or not, to provide the same advantages as our technologies, at a lower or comparable price, there is a risk that sound encoding technologies such as ours will be treated as commodities, resulting in loss of status of our technologies, decline in their use, and significant pricing pressure. To the extent that our audio technologies become a commodity, rather than a premium solution, our business, operating results, and prospects could be adversely affected. The loss of or delay in operations of one or more of our key suppliers could materially delay or stop the production of our products and impair our ability to generate revenue. Our reliance on outside suppliers for some of the key materials and components we use in manufacturing our products involves risks, including limited control over the price, timely delivery, and quality of such components. We have no agreements with our suppliers to ensure continued supply of materials and components. Although we have identified alternate suppliers for most of our key materials and components, any required changes in our suppliers could cause material delays in our production operations and increase our production costs. In addition, at times our suppliers have not been, and in the future may not be, able to meet our production demands as to volume, quality or timeliness. Moreover, we rely on sole source suppliers for some of the components that we use to manufacture our products, including specific charged coupled devices, light emitting diodes, and digital signal processors. These sole source suppliers may become unable or unwilling to deliver these components to us at an acceptable cost or at all, which could force us to redesign those specific products. Our inability to obtain timely delivery of key components of acceptable quality, any significant increases in the prices of components, or the redesign of our products could result in material production delays, increased costs, and reductions in shipments of our products, any of which could increase our operating costs, harm our customer relationships or materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. For example, during the quarter ending March 26, 2010, strong market demand for 3D and digital cinema units, combined with component constraints within the electronics industry and supplier manufacturing capacity constraints limited our ability to ship 3D and digital cinema products and accessories, creating a backlog of orders. Revenue from our products may suffer if our production processes encounter problems or if we are not able to match our production capacity to fluctuating levels of demand. Our products are highly complex and production difficulties or inefficiencies can interrupt production, resulting in our inability to deliver products on time in a cost effective manner, which could harm our competitive position. We have a single production facility, and we use contract manufacturers to produce some of our higher volume product lines as needed. Our reliance on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our higher volume products involves risks, including limited control over timely delivery and quality of such products. If production of our products is interrupted, we may not be able to manufacture products on a timely basis, and customers may purchase products from our competitors. A shortage of manufacturing capacity for our products could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships. We generally cannot quickly adapt our manufacturing capacity to rapidly changing market conditions and a contract manufacturer may encounter difficulties as well. Likewise, we may be unable to respond to fluctuations in customer demand. At times we underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for some of our products. Any inability to respond to fluctuations in customer demand for our products may adversely affect our gross margins. 31 Table of Contents Our products, from time to time, experience quality problems that can result in decreased sales and higher operating expenses. Our products are complex and sometimes contain undetected software or hardware errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released. In addition, to the extent that we engage contract manufacturers we do not have as much control over manufacturing which could result in quality problems. Furthermore, our products are sometimes combined with or incorporated into products from other vendors, sometimes making it difficult to identify the source of a problem. These errors could result in a loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or cause delays in delivering them and meeting customer demands, any of which could reduce our revenue and raise significant customer relations issues. In addition, if our products contain errors we could be required to replace or reengineer them, which would increase our costs. Moreover, if any such errors cause unintended consequences, we could face claims for product liability. Although we generally attempt to contractually limit liability for defective products to the cost of repairing or replacing these products, if these contract provisions are not enforced, or are unenforceable for any reason, or if liabilities arise that are not effectively limited, we could incur substantial costs in defending and settling product liability claims. Licensee products that incorporate our technologies, from time to time, experience quality problems that could damage our brand, decrease revenue, and increase operating expenses. Licensee products that incorporate our technologies often are complex and sometimes contain undetected software or hardware errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released. In addition, those products are often combined with, or incorporated into, products from other companies, sometimes making it difficult to identify the source of a problem. Any negative publicity or negative impact relating to these product problems could adversely affect the perception of our brand. In addition, these errors could result in loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of those products or Dolby technologies, or cause delays in delivering them and meeting customer demands, any of which could reduce our revenue and raise significant customer relations issues. Although we generally attempt to contractually limit our liability for our licensees defective products, we may elect to help reengineer those products, which could adversely affect our operating results. A loss of one or more of our key customers or licensees in any of our markets could adversely affect our operating results. From time to time, one or a small number of our customers or licensees may represent a significant percentage of our products, services or licensing revenue. For example, revenue from our largest customer represented approximately 12% of total revenue for fiscal 2010. Although we have agreements with many of these customers, these agreements typically do not require any minimum purchases or minimum royalty fees and do not prohibit customers from purchasing products and services from competitors. A decision by any of our major customers or licensees not to use our technologies, or their failure or inability to pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner, or at all, whether due to strategic redirections or adverse changes in their businesses or for other reasons, could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local, and international laws governing the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management, disposal, and labeling of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims, or could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault. The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict. 32 Table of Contents We also face increasing complexity in our product design as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products. For example, we redesigned our products so we could continue to offer them for sale within the European Union, when restrictions on lead and other hazardous substances that apply to specified electronic products put on the market in the European Union became effective in 2006. Similar requirements related to marking of electronic products became effective in China in 2007. For some products, substituting particular components containing regulated hazardous substances is more difficult or costly, and additional redesign efforts could result in production delays. Selected electronic products that we maintain in inventory may be rendered obsolete if not in compliance with the new environmental laws, which could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue from those products. We also expect that our operations, whether manufacturing or licensing, will be affected by other new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws and regulations, they will likely result in additional costs or decreased revenue, and could require that we redesign or change how we manufacture our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Continued global credit market weakness could negatively impact the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities, including money market funds, U.S. treasury and agency securities, municipal debt securities, corporate bonds, and commercial paper. Although we follow an established investment policy and seek to minimize the credit risk associated with investments, these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks. Any downgrades, losses, failed auctions or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash, cash equivalents or investments could negatively impact our investments or our ability to meet our investment objectives. Such negative impact, should it arise, could require an impairment charge, which would adversely impact our financial results. We face risks associated with international trade and currency exchange. We maintain sales, marketing, and business operations in foreign countries, most significantly in the United Kingdom. Consequently, we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates associated with the local currencies of our foreign business operations. While nearly all of our revenue is derived from transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, nearly all of our costs from our foreign operations are denominated in the currency of that foreign location. Consequently, exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could have a material impact on our profitability. We rely on distributors that we do not control. We rely significantly on a global network of independent, regional distributors to market and distribute our cinema and broadcast products. Our distributor arrangements are non-exclusive and our distributors are not obligated to buy our products and can represent competing products. If we lose a major distributor for any reason or if our distributors are unable or unwilling to dedicate the resources necessary to promote our portfolio of products, our revenue will be adversely affected. Difficulties in ongoing relationships with distributors, such as failures to adhere to our policies also could adversely affect us. For example, while we have implement policies designed to promote compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls, and local laws, we do not have direct control over the business and risk management policies adopted by our distributors, and they could act contrary to our policies. 33 Table of Contents For the foreseeable future, Ray Dolby or his affiliates will be able to control the selection of all members of our board of directors, as well as virtually every other matter that requires stockholder approval, which will severely limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters. At September 24, 2010, Ray Dolby and his affiliates owned 100 shares of our Class A common stock and 58,900,000 shares of our Class B common stock. As of September 24, 2010, Ray Dolby and his affiliates, including his family members, had voting power of approximately 99.5% of our outstanding Class B common stock, which in the aggregate represented approximately 91.3% of the combined voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. Under our certificate of incorporation, holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share while holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Generally, shares of Class B common stock automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock upon transfer of such Class B common stock, other than transfers to certain specified persons and entities, including the spouse and descendants of Ray Dolby and the spouses and domestic partners of such descendants. Because of this dual class structure, Ray Dolby, his affiliates, and his family members and descendants will, for the foreseeable future, have significant influence over our management and affairs, and will be able to control virtually all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other sales of our company or assets, even if they come to own considerably less than 50% of the total number of outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. Ray Dolby, his affiliates, his family members, and descendants will maintain this control even if in the future they come to own considerably less than 50% of the total number of outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. Moreover, these persons may take actions in their own interests that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. Absent a transfer of Class B common stock that would trigger an automatic conversion as described above, there is no threshold or time deadline at which the shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock. Assuming conversion of all shares of Class B common stock held by persons not affiliated with Ray Dolby into shares of Class A common stock, so long as Ray Dolby and his affiliates, his family members, and descendants continue to hold shares of Class B common stock representing approximately 10% or more of the total number of outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock, they will hold a majority of the combined voting power of the Class A and Class B common stock. Future sales of shares by insiders could cause our stock price to decline. If our founder, officers, directors or employees sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, including shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B common stock, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. As of September 24, 2010, we had a total of 112,084,039 shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. Of these shares, 31,625,000 shares of Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering by us and the selling stockholders, and an additional 8,000,000 shares of Class A common stock were sold in a secondary offering in May 2007 by our principal stockholder. As of September 24, 2010, our directors and executive officers beneficially held 58,980,000 shares of Class B common stock, 34,180 shares of Class A common stock, vested options to purchase 250,000 shares of Class B common stock and vested options to purchase 395,767 shares of Class A common stock. We expect that any sale of our Class A common stock by our directors and executive officers would be subject to compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
