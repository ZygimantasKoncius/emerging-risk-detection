Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Inherent in Our BusinessOur business depends on hydrocarbon supply and demand fundamentals, which can be adversely affected by numerous factors outside of our control.Our success depends on the supply and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. The degree to which our business is impacted by changes in supply or demand varies. Our business can be negatively impacted by sustained downturns in supply and demand for one or more commodities, including reductions in our ability to renew contracts on favorable terms and to construct new infrastructure. For example, major factors that will impact natural gas demand domestically will be the realization of potential liquefied natural gas exports and demand growth within the power generation market, and a major factor impacting oil and gas supplies has been the significant growth in unconventional sources such as shale plays. In addition, the supply and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil for our business will depend on many other factors outside of our control, some of which include:•adverse changes in general global economic conditions. The level and speed of the recovery from the recent recession remains uncertain and could impact the supply and demand for natural gas and our future rate of growth in our business;•adverse changes in domestic regulations that could impact the supply or demand for oil and gas;•technological advancements that may drive further increases in production and reduction in costs of developing shale plays;•competition from imported supplies and alternate fuels;•commodity price changes that could negatively impact the supply of, or the demand for these products;•increased costs to explore for, develop, produce, gather, process or transport commodities;•adoption of various energy efficiency and conservation measures; and•perceptions of customers on the availability and price volatility of our services, particularly customers’ perceptions on the volatility of commodity prices over the longer-term.If volatility and seasonality in the oil and gas industry decrease, because of increased production capacity or otherwise, the demand for our services and the prices that we will be able to charge for those services may decline. In addition to volatility and seasonality, an extended period of high commodity prices would likely place upward pressure on the costs of associated expansion activities. An extended period of low commodity prices could adversely impact storage and transportation values for some period of time until market conditions adjust. These commodity price impacts could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future growth may be limited if we do not complete growth projects or make acquisitions.Our business strategy depends on our ability to complete growth projects and make acquisitions that increase cash generated from operations on a per unit basis. We may be unable to complete successful, accretive growth projects or acquisitions for any of the following reasons, among others: •we fail to identify (or we are outbid for) attractive expansion or development projects or acquisition candidates that satisfy our economic and other criteria;•we cannot raise financing for such projects or acquisitions on economically acceptable terms;•we fail to secure adequate customer commitments to use the facilities to be developed, expanded or acquired; or•we cannot obtain governmental approvals or other rights, licenses or consents needed to complete such projects or acquisitions on time or on budget, if at all.The development and construction of gathering, processing, storage and transportation facilities involves numerous regulatory, environmental, safety, political and legal uncertainties beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. When we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular growth project. For instance, if we build a new gathering system or transmission pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive material increases in revenues until the project is placed in service. Accordingly, if we do pursue growth projects, we can provide no assurances that our efforts will provide a platform for additional growth for our company.25Table of ContentsThe growth projects and acquisitions we complete may not perform as anticipated.Even if we complete acquisitions or growth projects that we believe will be strategic and accretive, such acquisitions and projects may nevertheless reduce our cash available for distribution due to the following factors, among others: •mistaken assumptions about capacity, revenues, synergies, costs (including operating and administrative, capital, debt and equity costs), customer demand, growth potential, assumed liabilities and other factors;•the failure to receive cash flows from a growth project or newly acquired asset due to delays in the commencement of operations for any reason;•unforeseen operational issues or the realization of liabilities that were not known to us at the time the acquisition or growth project was completed;•the inability to attract new customers or retain acquired customers to the extent assumed in connection with an acquisition or growth project;•the failure to successfully integrate growth projects or acquired assets or businesses into our operations and/or the loss of key employees; or•the impact of regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties that are beyond our control. In particular, we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production and/or demand in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions.If we complete future growth projects or acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources. If any growth projects or acquisitions we ultimately complete are not accretive to our cash available for distribution, our ability to make distributions may be reduced. We may rely upon third-party assets to operate our facilities, and we could be negatively impacted by circumstances beyond our control that temporarily or permanently interrupt the operation of such third-party assets.Certain of our operations depend on assets owned and controlled by third parties to operate effectively. For example, (i) certain of our “rich gas” gathering systems depend on interconnections and processing plants owned by third parties for us to move gas off our systems; (ii) our crude oil rail terminals depend on railroad companies to move our customers’ crude oil to market; and (iii) our natural gas storage facilities rely on third-party interconnections and pipelines to receive and deliver natural gas. Since we do not own or operate these third-party facilities, their continuing operation is outside of our control. If third-party facilities become unavailable or constrained, or other downstream facilities utilized to move our customers’ product to their end destination become unavailable, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and ability to make distributions.In addition, the rates charged by processing plants, pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our assets affect the utilization and value of our services. Significant changes in the rates charged by these third parties, or the rates charged by the third parties that own “downstream” assets required to move commodities to their final destinations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions.We depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues.We generate a substantial portion of our gathering revenue from a limited number of oil and gas producers. Within our G&P segment, the top two producers (Antero in the Marcellus Shale and Quicksilver in the Barnett Shale) accounted for approximately 3% and 2% of our total consolidated revenues in 2014, respectively. Within our NGL and crude services segment, five producers primarily on our Arrow system in the Bakken Shale accounted for approximately 34% of our total consolidated revenues in 2014. Given the current commodity price environment and its anticipated impact on shale production, we expect our gathering earnings to remain leveraged to a limited number of producers in 2015 as we continue to build out our gathering systems, particularly in the Marcellus, Bakken and PRB Niobrara. Because we depend on a limited number of customers, a loss of a significant customer or failure to perform by a significant customer could cause a significant decline in our revenues. In particular, in February 2015, Quicksilver announced its decision not to make an interest payment due under its indenture and to enter into a 30-day grace period under the applicable indenture. This could result in an event of default under the indenture, which could lead Quicksilver to seek voluntary protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.26Table of ContentsAlthough we have obtained acreage dedications from many producer customers, most of our gathering contracts do not contain minimum volume requirements that would protect us against volumetric risks associated with lower-than-forecast volumes flowing through our systems. Our producer customers do not have contractual obligations to develop their properties in the areas covered by our acreage dedications, and they may determine that it is more attractive to direct their capital spending and resources to other areas. A decrease in producer capital spending and reserves in the areas covered by our acreage dedications with our significant gathering customers could result in reduced volumes serviced by us and a material decline in our revenue and cash flow.Declines in natural gas, NGL or crude prices could adversely affect our business. Sustained low natural gas, NGL or crude oil prices impact natural gas and oil exploration and production activity levels and can result in a decline in the production of hydrocarbons over time, resulting in reduced throughput on our systems and terminals. Such a decline could also potentially affect the ability of our customers to continue their operations. As a result, sustained low natural gas and crude oil prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In general, the prices of natural gas, oil, condensate, NGLs and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. For example, market prices for natural gas has declined substantially since 2008 and have remained low for several years. More recently, the increased supply resulting from the rapid development of shale plays throughout North America has contributed significantly to the rapid decline in crude oil prices.Our gathering and processing operations depend, in part, on drilling and production decisions of others.Our gathering and processing operations are dependent on the continued availability of natural gas and crude oil production. We have no control over the level of drilling activity in our areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to our systems, or the rate at which production from a well declines. Our gathering systems are connected to wells whose production will naturally decline over time, which means that our cash flows associated with these wells will decline over time. To maintain or increase throughput levels on our gathering systems and utilization rates at our natural gas processing plants, we must continually obtain new natural gas and crude oil supplies. Our ability to obtain additional sources of natural gas and crude oil primarily depends on the level of successful drilling activity near our systems, our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells, and our ability to expand our system capacity as needed. If we are not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas and crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, throughput on our gathering and processing facilities would decline, which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and distributable cash flow. Although we have acreage dedications from customers that include certain producing and non-producing oil and gas properties, our customers are not contractually required to develop the reserves and or properties they have dedicated to us. We have no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions in our areas of operations, which are affected by, among other things, (i) the availability and cost of capital; (ii) prevailing and projected commodity prices; (iii) demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, (iv) levels of reserves and geological considerations, (v) governmental regulations, including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing; and (vi) the availability of drilling rigs and other development services. Fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of oil and gas reserves. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease, and sustained declines in commodity prices could lead to a material decrease in such activity. Because of these factors, even if oil and gas reserves are known to exist in areas served by our assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Reductions in exploration or production activity in our areas of operations could lead to reduced utilization of our systems.Estimates of oil and gas reserves depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate, and future volumes on our gathering systems may be less than anticipated.We normally do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas or crude oil reserves connected to our gathering systems. We therefore do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. It often takes producers longer periods of time to determine how to efficiently develop and produce hydrocarbons from unconventional shale plays than conventional basins, which can result in lower volumes becoming available as soon as expected in the shale plays in which we operate. If the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves connected to our gathering systems is less than anticipated and we are unable to secure additional sources of natural gas or crude oil, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our NGL supply and logistics businesses are seasonal and generally have lower cash flows in certain periods during the year, which may require us to borrow money to fund our working capital needs of these businesses.27Table of ContentsThe natural gas liquids inventory we pre-sell to our customers is higher during the second and third quarters of a given year, and our cash receipts during that period are lower. As a result, we may have to borrow money to fund the working capital needs of our NGL supply and logistics businesses during those periods. Any restrictions on our ability to borrow money could impact our ability to pay quarterly distributions to our unitholders. Counterparties to our commodity derivative and physical purchase and sale contracts in our NGL supply and logistics businesses may not be able to perform their obligations to us, which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations.We encounter risk of counterparty non-performance in our NGL supply and logistics businesses. Disruptions in the price or supply of NGLs for an extended or near term period of time could result in counterparty defaults on our derivative and physical purchase and sale contracts. This could impair our expected earnings from the derivative or physical sales contracts, our ability to obtain supply to fulfill our sales delivery commitments or our ability to obtain supply at reasonable prices, which could result adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Our NGL supply and logistics businesses are subject to commodity risk, basis risk, or risk of adverse market conditions which can adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We attempt to lock in a margin for a portion of the commodities we purchase by selling such commodities for physical delivery to our customers or by entering into future delivery obligations under contracts for forward sale. Through these transactions, we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchases, and sales or future delivery obligations. Any event that disrupts our anticipated physical supply of commodities could expose us to risk of loss resulting from the need to fulfill our obligations required under contracts for forward sale. Basis risk describes the inherent market price risk created when a commodity of certain grade or location is purchased, sold or exchanged as compared to a purchase, sale or exchange of a like commodity at a different time or place. Transportation costs and timing differentials are components of basis risk. In a backwardated market (when prices for future deliveries are lower than current prices), basis risk is created with respect to timing. In these instances, physical inventory generally loses value as the price of such physical inventory declines over time. Basis risk cannot be entirely eliminated, and basis exposure, particularly in backwardated or other adverse market conditions, can adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We have limited experience in the crude oil gathering business.We acquired the Arrow gathering system in November 2013, which serves customers producing crude oil and rich gas from the Bakken Shale formation. The Arrow system is the first crude oil and produced water gathering system that we have been required to build out and operate. Other operators of gathering systems in the Bakken have more experience in the construction, operation and maintenance of crude oil gathering systems than we do. Our lack of experience may hinder our ability to fully implement our business plan in a timely and cost-effective manner, which may adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions.Our industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to execute our growth strategy.We compete with other energy midstream enterprises, some of which are much larger and have significantly greater financial resources or operating experience, in our areas of operation. Our competitors may expand or construct infrastructure that creates additional competition for the services we provide to customers. Our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make distributions.Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations, limit our ability to react to changes in our business or industry, and place us at a competitive disadvantage.We had approximately $2.4 billion of long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy debt obligations or to obtain alternative financing could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.Our substantial debt could have important consequences to our unitholders. For example, it could:28Table of Contents•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to fund future capital expenditures and working capital, to engage in development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of interest and principal on our debt or to comply with any restrictive covenants or terms of our debt;•result in an event of default if we fail to satisfy debt obligations or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit our lenders to foreclose on any of the collateral securing such debt;•require a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;•increase our cost of borrowing;•restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or industry in which we operate, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers who are less highly leveraged and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploring; and•impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.Realization of any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Restrictions in our revolving credit facilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions. We have a $495 million revolving credit facility that matures in July 2016. Our revolving credit facility will be available to fund working capital and our growth projects, make acquisitions and for general partnership purposes. Crestwood Midstream has a $1 billion revolving credit facility (expandable up to $1.25 billion) that matures in October 2018. Crestwood Midstream’s revolving credit facility will be available to fund working capital and its growth projects, make acquisitions and for general partnership purposes. Our revolving credit facilities contain various covenants and restrictive provisions that will limit our ability to, among other things: •incur additional debt;•make distributions on or redeem or repurchase units;•make certain investments and acquisitions;•incur or permit certain liens to exist;•enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;•merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company; and•transfer or otherwise dispose of assets. Furthermore, our revolving credit facilities contain covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios. For example, (i) our revolving credit facility requires maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) of no greater than 5.50 to 1.0 for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, 5.25 to 1.0 for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, 5.00 to 1.0 for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, and 4.75 to 1.0 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and all subsequent quarters; (ii) our interest coverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) should not be less than 2.50 to 1.00, and (ii) Crestwood Midstream’s credit facility requires maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in its credit agreement) of not more than 5.00 to 1.00 (and, if applicable, 5.50 to 1.0 during certain periods immediately following a material acquisition) and an interest coverage ratio (as defined in its credit agreement) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility are secured by pledges of the equity interests of, and guarantees by, substantially all of our restricted domestic subsidiaries, and liens on substantially all of our real and personal property. Borrowings under 29Table of ContentsCrestwood Midstream’s revolving credit facility are secured by pledges of the equity interests of, and guarantees by, substantially all of its restricted domestic subsidiaries, and liens on substantially all of its real property (outside of New York) and personal property. The provisions of our credit agreements may affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our revolving credit facilities could result in events of default, which could enable our lenders, subject to the terms and conditions of credit agreements, to declare any outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of any such debt is accelerated, our assets (and, with respect to Crestwood Midstream’s revolver, Crestwood Midstream’s assets) may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and the holders of our common units could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.A change of control could result in us facing substantial repayment obligations under our revolving credit facilities.Our credit agreements contain provisions relating to change of control of our general partners and our partnerships. If these provisions are triggered, our outstanding bank indebtedness may become due. In such an event, there is no assurance that we would be able to pay the indebtedness, in which case the lenders under our revolving credit facilities would have the right to foreclose on our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on us. There is no restriction on the ability of our general partner or its parent companies to enter into a transaction which would trigger the change of control provisions, and there are no restrictions on our ability to enter into a transaction which would trigger Crestwood Midstream’s change of control provisions.Our ability to make cash distributions may be diminished, and our financial leverage could increase, if we are not able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms.Historically, each of the Crestwood Equity and Crestwood Midstream have used cash flow from operations, borrowings under its respective revolving credit facility and issuances of debt or equity to fund their respective capital programs, working capital needs and acquisitions. Our capital program may require additional financing above the level of cash generated by our respective operations to fund growth. If our cash flow from operations decreases as a result of lower throughput volumes on our systems or otherwise, our ability to expend the capital necessary to expand our business or increase our future cash distributions may be limited. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to satisfy our financing needs, we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Our ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by our financial condition or general economic conditions at the time of any such financing or offering. Even if we are successful in obtaining the necessary funds, the terms of such financings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Further, incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage and issuing additional limited partner interests may result in significant unitholder dilution and would increase the aggregate amount of cash required to maintain the cash distribution rate which could materially decrease our ability to pay distributions. If additional capital resources are unavailable, we may curtail our activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis.Increases in interest rates could adversely impact our unit price, ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, and ability to make payments on our debt obligations.Interest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. Therefore, changes in interest rates either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to make payments on our debt obligations.The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management team, as well as on our ability to attract and retain both executives and employees for our field operations. Our senior executives have significant experience in the oil and gas industry and have developed strong relationships with a broad range of industry participants. The loss of any of these executives, or the loss of key field employees operating in competitive markets like the Bakken Shale and the Marcellus Shale, could prevent us from implementing our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships, results of operations and ability to make distributions.30Table of ContentsWe operate in the PRB Niobrara and the Texas Gulf Coast through joint ventures that may limit our operational flexibility.Our operations in the PRB Niobrara and our storage operations in the Texas Gulf Coast market are conducted through joint venture arrangements (including the Jackalope and PRBIC joint ventures in the PRB Niobrara and our Tres Palacios joint venture in the Texas Gulf Coast market), and we may enter additional joint ventures in the future. In a joint venture arrangement, we could have less operational flexibility, as actions must be taken in accordance with the applicable governing provisions of the joint venture. In certain cases, we:•could have limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations;•could have limited control on the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to these operations;•could be dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures;•may be subject to restrictions or limitations on our ability to sell or transfer our interests in the jointly owned assets; and•may be forced to offer rights of participation to other joint venture participants in certain areas of mutual interest.In addition, our joint venture participants may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay substantial carried costs pertaining to the joint venture and to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. The performance and ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under joint venture arrangements is outside of our control. If these parties do not satisfy their obligations, our business may be adversely affected. Our joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives, and disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses. The risks described above or the failure to continue our joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with our joint venture partners could adversely affect our ability to conduct business that is the subject of a joint venture, which could in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts. Our primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time our existing contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation and renewal. As of December 31, 2014, the weighted average remaining term of (i) our consolidated portfolio of natural gas storage and transportation contracts is approximately three years, (ii) our consolidated portfolio of natural gas gathering contracts is approximately 11 years, and (iii) our consolidated portfolio of crude oil gathering contracts is approximately five years. The extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including:•the macroeconomic factors affecting natural gas, NGL and crude economics for our current and potential customers;•the level of existing and new competition to provide services to our markets;•the balance of supply and demand, on a short-term, seasonal and long-term basis, in our markets;•the extent to which the customers in our markets are willing to contract on a long-term basis; and•the effects of federal, state or local regulations on the contracting practices of our customers.Any failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our existing contracts, or extending or replacing them at unfavorable or lower rates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions. The fees we charge to customers under our contracts may not escalate sufficiently to cover our cost increases, and those contracts may be suspended in some circumstances. Our costs may increase at a rate greater than the rate that the fees we charge to third parties increase pursuant to our contracts with them. In addition, some third parties’ obligations under their agreements with us may be permanently or temporarily reduced upon the occurrence of certain events, some of which are beyond our control, including force majeure events wherein the supply of natural gas or crude oil is curtailed or cut off. Force majeure events generally include, without limitation, revolutions, wars, acts of enemies, embargoes, import or export restrictions, strikes, lockouts, fires, storms, floods, acts of God, explosions, mechanical or physical failures of our equipment or facilities or those of third parties. If our escalation of fees is insufficient to cover increased costs or if any third party suspends or terminates its contracts with us, our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions could be materially adversely affected.31Table of ContentsOur operations are subject to extensive regulation, and regulatory measures adopted by regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. For example, because we transport natural gas in interstate commerce and we store natural gas that is transported in interstate commerce, our natural gas storage and transportation facilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act. Federal regulation under the Natural Gas Act extends to such matters as: •rates, operating terms and conditions of service;•the form of tariffs governing service;•the types of services we may offer to our customers;•the certification and construction of new, or the expansion of existing, facilities;•the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities;•contracts for service between storage and transportation providers and their customers;•creditworthiness and credit support requirements;•the maintenance of accounts and records;•relationships among affiliated companies involved in certain aspects of the natural gas business;•the initiation and discontinuation of services; and•various other matters. Natural gas companies may not charge rates that, upon review by FERC, are found to be unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory. Existing interstate transportation and storage rates may be challenged by complaint and are subject to prospective change by FERC. Additionally, rate increases proposed by a regulated pipeline or storage provider may be challenged and such increases may ultimately be rejected by FERC. We currently hold authority from FERC to charge and collect (i) market-based rates for interstate storage services provided at the Stagecoach, Thomas Corners, Seneca Lake, Steuben and Tres Palacios facilities and (ii) negotiated rates for interstate transportation services provided by our North-South Facilities and MARC I Pipeline. FERC's “market-based rate” policy allows regulated entities to charge rates different from, and in some cases, less than, those which would be permitted under traditional cost-of-service regulation. Among the sorts of changes in circumstances that could raise market power concerns would be an expansion of capacity, acquisitions or other changes in market dynamics. There can be no guarantee that we will be allowed to continue to operate under such rate structures for the remainder of those assets' operating lives. Any successful challenge against rates charged for our storage and transportation services, or our loss of market-based rate authority or negotiated rate authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions. Our market-based rate authority for our natural gas storage facilities may be subject to review and possible revocation if FERC determines that we have the ability to exercise market power in our market area. If we were to lose our ability to charge market-based rates, we would be required to file rates based on our cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return. Cost-of-service rates may be lower than our current market-based rates. There can be no assurance that FERC will continue to pursue its approach of pro-competitive policies as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to natural gas transportation capacity and transportation and storage facilities. Failure to comply with applicable regulations under the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, the Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and certain other laws, and with implementing regulations associated with these laws, could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day, per violation.A change in the jurisdictional characterization of our gathering assets may result in increased regulation, which could cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.Our natural gas and crude oil gathering operations are generally exempt from the jurisdiction and regulation of the FERC, except for certain anti-market manipulation provisions. FERC regulation nonetheless affects our businesses and the markets for products derived from our gathering businesses. The FERC’s policies and practices across the range of its oil and gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on open access transportation, rate making, capacity release and market center promotion, indirectly affect intrastate markets. In recent years, the FERC has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines. However, we have no assurance that the FERC will continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to oil and natural gas transportation capacity. In addition, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services has regularly been the subject of substantial, on-going litigation. Consequently, the classification and regulation of some of our pipelines could change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If 32Table of Contentsour gathering operations become subject to FERC jurisdiction, the result may adversely affect the rates we are able to charge and the services we currently provide, and may include the potential for a termination of certain gathering agreements.State and municipal regulations also impact our business. Common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to gather or provide services without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer; as a result, these statutes restrict our right to decide whose production we gather or transport. Federal law leaves any economic regulation of natural gas gathering to the states. The states in which we currently operate have adopted complaint-based regulation of gathering activities, which allows oil and gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve access and rate grievances. Other state and municipal regulations may not directly regulate our gathering business, but may nonetheless affect the availability of natural gas for purchase, processing and sale, including state regulation of production rates and maximum daily production allowable from gas wells. While our gathering lines currently are subject to limited state regulation, there is a risk that state laws will be changed, which may give producers a stronger basis to challenge the rates, terms and conditions of its gathering lines.Our operations are subject to compliance with environmental and operational safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities. Our operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing health and safety aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Such environmental laws and regulations impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the incurrence of capital expenditures to comply with applicable legal requirements, the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protections and the imposition of restrictions on the generation, handling, treatment, storage, disposal and transportation of materials and wastes. Failure to comply with such environmental laws and regulations can result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial liabilities and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities. Certain environmental laws impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where materials or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. In the course of our operations, generated materials or wastes may have been spilled or released from properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these materials or wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. It is also possible that adoption of stricter environmental laws and regulations or more stringent interpretation of existing environmental laws and regulations in the future could result in additional costs or liabilities to us as well as the industry in general or otherwise adversely affect demand for our services and salt products. For example, in January 2015, the Obama Administration announced plans for the EPA to issue final standards in 2016 that would reduce methane emissions from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025, and, in December 2014, the EPA published a proposed rulemaking that it expects to finalized by October 1, 2015 that would seek to reduce the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone to between 65 and 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating and capital costs and reduced demand for our services. The EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet best available control technology standards that typically will be established by the states. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring the annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States including certain oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. On December 9, 2014, the EPA published a proposed rule that would expand the petroleum and natural gas system sources for which annual GHG emissions reporting is currently required to include GHG emissions reporting beginning in the 2016 reporting year for certain onshore gathering and boosting systems consisting primarily of gathering pipelines, compressors and process equipment used to perform natural gas compression, dehydration and acid gas removal. While the United States Congress has considered adopting legislation from time to time to reduce emissions of GHGs, in the absence of any such legislation in recent years, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking 33Table of Contentsor reducing emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas that is produced, which may decrease demand for our midstream services. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may incur higher costs as a result of pipeline integrity management program testing and additional safety legislation.Pursuant to authority under the NGPSA and HLPSA, PHMSA requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for pipelines located where a leak or rupture could harm “high consequence areas”. The regulations require operators like us to:•perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;•identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;•maintain processes for data collection, integration and analysis;•repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and•implement preventive and mitigating actions.We estimate that the total future costs to complete the testing required by existing PHMSA regulations will not have a material impact to our results. This estimate does not include the costs, if any, for repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program itself.Moreover, the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act is the most recent federal legislation to amend the NGPSA and HLPSA pipeline safety laws, requiring increased safety measures for gas and hazardous liquids pipelines. Among other things, the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act directs the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve us, leak detection system installation, testing to confirm the material strength of certain pipelines and operator verification of records confirming the maximum allowable pressure of certain instrastate gas transmission pipelines. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act also increases the maximum penalty for violation of pipeline safety regulations from $100,000 to $200,000 per violation per day and also from $1 million to $2 million for a related series of violations. The PHMSA has also published an advanced notice of proposed rule making to solicit comments on the need for changes to its safety regulations, including whether to revise the integrity management requirements and add new regulations governing the safety of gathering lines. Most recently, in an August 2014 report to Congress from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the agency acknowledged PHMSA's continued assessment of these pipeline safety risks and recommended that PHMSA move forward with rulemaking to address larger-diameter, higher-pressure gathering lines, including subjecting such pipelines to emergency response planning requirements that currently do not apply. Such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations through more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations and higher penalties for the violation of those regulations.Our business involves many hazards and risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.Our operations are subject to many risks inherent in gathering, processing, storage and transportation segments of the energy midstream industry, such as:•damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by natural disasters and acts of terrorism;•subsidence of the geological structures where we store natural gas or NGLs, or storage cavern collapses;•operator error;•inadvertent damage from construction, farm and utility equipment;•leaks, migrations or losses of natural gas, NGLs or crude oil;•fires and explosions;•cyber intrusions; and•other hazards that could also result in personal injury, including loss of life, property and natural resources damage, pollution of the environmental or suspension of operations.34Table of ContentsThese risks could result in substantial losses due to breaches of contractual commitments, personal injury and/or loss of life, damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. For example, we experienced three releases on our Arrow water gathering system during 2014 that resulted in a spill of an estimated 28,000 barrels of produced water on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota, the remediation and repair costs of which we believe are covered by insurance but nonetheless potentially subjects us to substantial penalties, fines and damages from regulatory agencies and individual landowners. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of our operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We are not fully insured against all risks inherent in our business. For example, we do not have any property insurance on any of our underground pipeline systems that would cover damage to the pipelines. We are also not insured against all environmental accidents that might occur, some of which may result in toxic tort claims. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions.We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Additionally, we may be unable to recover from prior owners of our assets, pursuant to our indemnification rights, for potential environmental liabilities. Although we maintain insurance policies with insurers in such amounts and with such coverages and deductibles as we believe are reasonable and prudent, our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage.We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities (particularly our G&P facilities) have been constructed, which subjects us to the possibility of more onerous terms or increased costs to obtain and maintain valid easements and rights-of-way. We obtain standard easement rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties, and our rights frequently revert back to the landowner after we stop using the easement for its specified purpose. Therefore, these easements exist for varying periods of time. Our loss of easement rights could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, thereby resulting in a material reduction in our revenue, earnings and ability to make distributions.Terrorist attacks or “cyber security” events, or the threat of them, may adversely affect our business.The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations or “cyber security” events. These potential targets might include our pipeline systems or operating systems and may affect our ability to operate or control our pipeline assets, our operations could be disrupted and/or customer information could be stolen. The occurrence of one of these events could cause a substantial decrease in revenues, increased costs to respond or other financial loss, damage to reputation, increased regulation or litigation and or inaccurate information reported from our operations. These developments may subject our operations to increased risks, as well as increased costs, and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Risks Inherent in an Investment in UsWe may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses to enable us to pay quarterly distributions to our common unitholders. We may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay quarterly distributions to our common unitholders. The amount of cash we can distribute on our common units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations and payments of fees and expenses. Before we pay any distributions on our common units, we will establish reserves and pay fees and expenses, including reimbursements to our general partner and its affiliates, for all expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf. These costs will reduce the amount of cash available to pay distributions to our common unitholders. The amount of cash we can distribute on our common units will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things: •the amount of cash distributions we receive in connection with our ownership of 100% of Crestwood Midstream’s IDRs and 4% of its common units;35Table of Contents•the rates we charge for storage and transportation services and the amount of services our customers purchase from us, which will be affected by, among other things, the overall balance between the supply of and demand for commodities, governmental regulation of our rates and services, and our ability to obtain permits for growth projects;•force majeure events that damage our or third-party pipelines, facilities, related equipment and surrounding properties;•prevailing economic and market conditions;•governmental regulation, including changes in governmental regulation in our industry; •changes in tax laws;•the level of competition from other midstream companies;•the level of our operating and maintenance and general administrative costs; •the level of capital expenditures we make; •our ability to make borrowings under our revolving credit facility; and •the cost of acquisitions. In addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the level and timing of capital expenditures we make; the cost of acquisitions; our debt service requirements and other liabilities; fluctuations in our working capital needs; our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets; restrictions contained in our debt agreements; and the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner.Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions. We expect that we will distribute all of our available cash to our common unitholders and will rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As a result, to the extent we are unable to finance growth externally, our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow. In addition, because we distribute all of our available cash, our growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may impact the available cash that we have to distribute to our common unitholders.We may issue additional units without common unitholder approval, which would dilute existing common unitholder ownership interests. Our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests we may issue at any time without the approval of our existing common unitholders. The issuance of additional common units or other equity interests of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:•our existing common unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease; •the amount of cash available for distribution on each common unit may decrease; •the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase; •the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common unit may be diminished; and •the market price of the common units may decline.Holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors, which could reduce the price at which our common units will trade. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our common unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business. Our common unitholders will have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our general partner or its board of directors. The board of directors of our general partner, including the independent directors, is chosen entirely by Crestwood Holdings, as a result of it owning our general partner, and not by our common unitholders. Unlike publicly traded corporations, we will not conduct annual meetings of our common unitholders to elect directors or conduct other matters routinely conducted at annual meetings of stockholders of corporations. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units will trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.36Table of ContentsCommon unitholders may have liability to repay distributions and in certain circumstances may be personally liable for the obligations of the partnership. Under certain circumstances, common unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the Delaware Act), we may not make a distribution to our common unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. A purchaser of units who becomes a limited partner is liable for the obligations of the transferring limited partner to make contributions to the partnership that are known to the purchaser of units at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from the partnership agreement. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted. It may be determined that the right, or the exercise of the right by the limited partners as a group, to (i) remove or replace our general partner, (ii) approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or (iii) take other action under our partnership agreement constitutes “participation in the control” of our business. A limited partner that participates in the control of our business within the meaning of the Delaware Act may be held personally liable for our obligations under the laws of Delaware to the same extent as our general partner. This liability would extend to persons who transact business with us under the reasonable belief that the limited partner is a general partner. Neither our partnership agreement nor the Delaware Act specifically provides for legal recourse against our general partner if a limited partner were to lose limited liability through any fault of our general partner.The amount of cash we have available for distribution to common unitholders depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability, which may prevent us from making cash distributions during periods when we record net income. The amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow (the majority of which consists of the cash distributions we receive in connection with our ownership of 100% of Crestwood Midstream’s IDRs), including cash flow from reserves and working capital or other borrowings, and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may pay cash distributions during periods when we record net losses for financial accounting purposes and may not pay cash distributions during periods when we record net income.Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units. Our partnership agreement restricts unitholders' voting rights by providing that any units held by a person or group that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our general partner and its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner, cannot vote on any matter.Crestwood Holdings and its affiliates may sell common units in the public or private markets, and such sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units.As of December 31, 2014, Crestwood Holdings and its affiliates beneficially held an aggregate of 53,809,398 limited partner units. The sale of any or all of these units in the public or private markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market on which the common units are traded.Risks Inherent in Our Structure and Relationship with Crestwood MidstreamOur primary cash-generating assets are our partnership interests, including incentive distribution rights, in Crestwood Midstream, and our cash flow is therefore materially dependent upon the ability of Crestwood Midstream to make distributions in respect to those partnership interests to its partners.The amount of cash that Crestwood Midstream can distribute to its unitholders each quarter, including us with respect to our IDRs, principally depends upon the amount of cash Crestwood Midstream generates from its operations, which amounts of cash may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:37Table of Contents•the rates Crestwood Midstream charges for services and the amount of services their customers purchase from Crestwood Midstream, which will be affected by, among other things, the overall balance between the supply of and demand for natural gas, NGL and crude oil, governmental regulation of Crestwood Midstream’s rates and services, and Crestwood Midstream’s ability to obtain permits for growth projects; •force majeure events that damage Crestwood Midstream’s or third-party pipelines, facilities, related equipment and surrounding properties; •prevailing economic and market conditions; •governmental regulation, including changes in governmental regulation in Crestwood Midstream’s industry; •leaks or accidental releases of products or other materials into the environment, whether as a result of human error or otherwise; •difficulties in Crestwood Midstream collecting receivables because of its customers’ credit or financial problems; •changes in tax laws; •the level of competition from other midstream energy companies;•the level of Crestwood Midstream’s operating and maintenance and general administrative costs; •the level of capital expenditures Crestwood Midstream makes; •the ability of Crestwood Midstream to make borrowings under its revolving credit facility; and •the cost of acquisitions. In addition, the actual amount of cash Crestwood Midstream will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, some of which are beyond its control, including: the level and timing of capital expenditures it makes; the cost of acquisitions; its debt service requirements and other liabilities; fluctuations in its working capital needs; its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets; restrictions contained in its debt agreements and its partnership agreement; and the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner.We do not have control over many of these factors, including the level of cash reserves established by the board of directors of Crestwood Midstream’s general partner. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that Crestwood Midstream will have sufficient available cash to pay a specific level of cash distributions to its partners.If Crestwood Midstream reduced its per unit distribution, we would have less cash available for distribution and would probably be required to reduce our per unit distribution. Furthermore, the amount of cash that Crestwood Midstream has available for distribution depends primarily upon its cash flow, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings, and is not solely a function of profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, Crestwood Midstream may be able to make cash distributions during periods when it records losses and may not be able to make cash distributions during periods when it records net income.To the extent we purchase additional securities from Crestwood Midstream, our rate of growth may be reduced.Our business strategy may include supporting the growth of Crestwood Midstream by purchasing its securities or lending funds to Crestwood Midstream to provide funding for acquisitions or internal growth projects. To the extent we purchase common units, the rate of our distribution growth may be reduced, at least in the short term, as less of our cash distributions will come from our ownership of Crestwood Midstream’s IDRs, which distributions increase at a faster rate than those of our other securities.We could have an indemnification obligation to Crestwood Midstream, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition.We have entered into an omnibus agreement with Crestwood Midstream and its general partner that governs certain aspects of our relationship with them. Pursuant to the omnibus agreement, we are generally obligated to indemnify Crestwood Midstream and its affiliates against certain liabilities of the assets of the operations of Crestwood Midstream prior to December 21, 2011. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Omnibus Agreement.” Our indemnification obligations under the omnibus agreement could result in substantial expenses and liabilities to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition.Unitholders have less ability to elect or remove management than holders of common stock in a corporation.Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business, and therefore limited ability to influence management’s decisions regarding our business. Unitholders did not elect, and do not have the right to elect, our general partner or its board of directors on an annual or other continuing basis. The board of directors of our general partner is chosen by Crestwood Holdings LLC, the general partner of the sole member of our general partner, Crestwood Holdings LP (Holdings LP), which currently is the only voting member of the general partner of Holdings 38Table of ContentsLP, and effectively has the authority to appoint all of our directors. Although our general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage our partnership in a manner beneficial to us and our unitholders, the directors of our general partner also have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to its sole member, Holdings LP.If unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they will have little ability to remove our general partner. Our general partner generally may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders of 66⅔% of the outstanding units voting together as a single class.Our unitholders’ voting rights are further restricted by a provision in our partnership agreement providing that any units held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our general partner and its affiliates, cannot be voted on any matter.The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement on the ability of the owner of our general partner, Holdings LP, from transferring its ownership interest in our general partner to a third party. Additionally, Holdings LP’s general partner interest in our general partner is pledged as collateral under a Credit Agreement between Crestwood Holdings LLC and various lenders (Holdings Credit Agreement). In the event of a default by Crestwood Holdings LLC under the Holdings Credit Agreement, the lenders may foreclose on the pledged general partner interest and take or transfer control of our general partner without unitholder consent. The new owner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own choices and to control the decisions taken by our board of directors and officers. This effectively permits a “change of control” without the vote or consent of the common unitholders.Cost reimbursements paid to our general partner may be substantial and may reduce our ability to pay the quarterly distribution.Before making any distributions on our units, we will reimburse our general partner for all expenses it has incurred on our behalf. In addition, our general partner and its affiliates may provide us with services for which we will be charged reasonable fees as determined by our general partner. The reimbursement of these expenses and the payment of these fees could adversely affect our ability to make distributions our unitholders. Our general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses and fees.We may issue additional common units without unitholder approval, which would dilute our unitholders’ existing ownership interests.We may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests of any type without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance of additional common units or other equity securities of equal rank will have the following effects:•the proportionate ownership interest of our existing unitholders in us will decrease; •the amount of cash available for distribution on each common unit or partnership security may decrease; •the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common unit will be diminished; and •the market price of the common units or partnership securities may decline. Crestwood Midstream may issue additional common units, which may increase the risk that it will not have sufficient available cash to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level.The Crestwood Midstream partnership agreement allows it to issue an unlimited number of additional limited partner interests. The issuance of additional common units or other equity securities by Crestwood Midstream will have the following effects:•Our unitholders’ current proportionate ownership interest in Crestwood Midstream will decrease; •the amount of cash available for distribution on each common unit or partnership security may decrease; •the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase; •the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common unit may be diminished; and •the market price of Crestwood Midstream’s common units may decline. The payment of distributions on any additional units issued by Crestwood Midstream may increase the risk that Crestwood Midstream may not have sufficient cash available to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that we have to meet our obligations.39Table of ContentsIf we cease to manage and control Crestwood Midstream in the future, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.If we cease to manage and control Crestwood Midstream and are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act) we would either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, obtain exemptive relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission or modify our organizational structure or our contract rights to fall outside the definition of an investment company. Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates, restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add additional directors who are independent of us or our affiliates.Moreover, treatment of us as an investment company would prevent our qualification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, in which case we would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. For further discussion of the importance of our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and the implications that would result from our treatment as a corporation in any taxable year, please read the risk factor below entitled “The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships is subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes. If we or Crestwood Midstream were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, or if we or Crestwood Midstream were to become subject to a material amount of state or local taxation, then our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced.Although we control Crestwood Midstream through our ownership of its general partner, Crestwood Midstream’s general partner owes fiduciary duties to Crestwood Midstream’s unitholders, which may conflict with our interests.Conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and Crestwood Midstream and its limited partners, on the other hand. The directors and officers of Crestwood Midstream’s general partner have fiduciary duties to manage Crestwood Midstream in a manner beneficial to us. At the same time, Crestwood Midstream’s general partner has fiduciary duties to manage Crestwood Midstream in a manner beneficial to Crestwood Midstream and its limited partners. The board of directors of Crestwood Midstream’s general partner will resolve any such conflict and has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the conflict. The resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our best interest.For example, conflicts of interest with Crestwood Midstream may arise in the following situations:•the allocation of shared overhead expenses to Crestwood Midstream and us; •the interpretation and enforcement of contractual obligations between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and Crestwood Midstream, on the other hand; •the determination of the amount of cash to be distributed to Crestwood Midstream’s limited partners and the amount of cash to be reserved for the future conduct of Crestwood Midstream’s business; and•the determination whether to make borrowings under Crestwood Midstream’s revolving credit facility to pay distributions to Crestwood Midstream’s limited partners. The fiduciary duties of our general partner’s officers and directors may conflict with those of Crestwood Midstream’s general partner.Conflicts of interest may arise because of the relationships among Crestwood Midstream, its general partner and us. Our general partner’s directors and officers have fiduciary duties to manage our business in a manner beneficial to us and our unitholders. Some of our general partner’s directors and officers are also directors and officers of Crestwood Midstream’s general partner, and have fiduciary duties to manage the business of Crestwood Midstream in a manner beneficial to Crestwood Midstream and its unitholders. The resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our best interest or that of our unitholders.Affiliates of our general partner are not prohibited from competing with us.Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will be restricted from engaging in any business activities other than acting as our general partner and those activities incidental to its ownership of interests in us. Except as provided in our partnership agreement, affiliates of our general partner are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us.40Table of ContentsPotential conflicts of interest may arise among our general partner, its affiliates and us. Our general partner and its affiliates have limited fiduciary duties to us, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of us.Conflicts of interest may arise among our general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over our interests. These conflicts include, among others, the following:•Our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, including Crestwood Midstream and its affiliates and any general partner and limited partnerships acquired in the future, in resolving conflicts of interest, which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duties to us. •Our general partner has limited its liability and reduced its fiduciary duties under the terms of our partnership agreement, while also restricting the remedies available for actions that, without these limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. As a result of purchasing our units, unitholders consent to various actions and conflicts of interest that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law. •Our general partner determines the amount and timing of our investment transactions, borrowings, issuances of additional partnership securities and reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution. •Our general partner determines which costs it and its affiliates have incurred are reimbursable by us. •Our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered, or from entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf, so long as the terms of any such payments or additional contractual arrangements are fair and reasonable to us. •Our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it and its affiliates. •Our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us. Our partnership agreement limits our general partner’s fiduciary duties to us and restricts the remedies available for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.Our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce the standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement:•provides that our general partner is entitled to make decisions in “good faith” if it reasonably believes that the decisions are in our best interests; •generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the Conflicts Committee of the board of directors of our general partner and not involving a vote of unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or be “fair and reasonable” to us and that, in determining whether a transaction or resolution is “fair and reasonable,” our general partner may consider the totality of the relationships among the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us; and •provides that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or those other persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence. Our general partner has a limited call right that may require unitholders to sell their units at an undesirable time or price.If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of our outstanding units, our general partner will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then-current market price. As a result, unitholders may be required to sell their units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on their investment. Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units. As of December 31, 2014, the directors and executive officers of our general partner owned approximately 12% of our common units.Our cash distribution policy limits our ability to grow.Because we distribute all of our available cash, our growth may not be as rapid as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. If we issue additional units or incur debt to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units or interest on that debt could increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level.41Table of ContentsTax Risks to Common UnitholdersOur tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or we or Crestwood Midstream were to become subject to material additional amounts of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution to unitholders would be substantially reduced.The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The value of our investment in Crestwood Midstream depends largely on Crestwood Midstream being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we and Crestwood Midstream are each organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we and Crestwood Midstream would each be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we each satisfy a “qualifying income” requirement. Based upon our current operations, we and Crestwood Midstream each believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. Failing to meet the qualifying income requirement or a change in current law could cause us or Crestwood Midstream to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity. If we or Crestwood Midstream were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we each would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%, as well as any applicable state or local taxes. Distributions to our unitholders and Crestwood Midstream’s unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of us or Crestwood Midstream as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our respective common unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units. Our partnership agreement, as well as that of Crestwood Midstream, provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us. At the state level, several states have been evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise, or other forms of taxation. Imposition of a similar tax on us in the jurisdictions in which we operate or in other jurisdictions to which we may expand could substantially reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders or Crestwood Midstream’s unitholders.The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our or Crestwood Midstream’s common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us and Crestwood Midstream, or an investment in our or Crestwood Midstream’s common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. For example, the Obama administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2016 recommends that certain publicly traded partnerships earning income from activities related to fossil fuels be taxed as corporations beginning in 2021. From time to time, members of Congress propose and consider such substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. If successful, the Obama administration’s proposal or other similar proposals could eliminate the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly-traded partnerships as corporations upon which we and Crestwood Midstream rely for our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us or Crestwood Midstream to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our or Crestwood Midstream’s common units. If the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.Neither we nor Crestwood Midstream has requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which 42Table of Contentsthey trade. In addition, the costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by you and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution.You will be required to pay taxes on your share of our income even if you do not receive cash distributions from us.You will be required to pay any federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on your share of our taxable income, whether or not you receive cash distributions from us. You may not receive cash distributions from us equal to your share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability which results from that income.Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.If you sell your common units, you will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between your amount realized and your tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of your allocable share of our total net taxable income result in a reduction in your tax basis in your common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units you sell will, in effect, become taxable income to you if you sell such units at a price greater than your tax basis in those common units, even if the price you receive is less than your original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture of depreciation deductions. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if you sell your units, you may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash you receive from the sale.Tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.Investment in common units by tax-exempt entities, including employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as “IRAs”), and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from federal income tax, including individual retirement accounts and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Distributions to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes imposed at the highest effective applicable tax rate, and non-U.S. persons will be required to file U. S. federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income. If you are a tax-exempt entity or a non-U.S. person, you should consult your tax advisor before investing in our common units.We and Crestwood Midstream will treat each purchaser of our respective common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the specific common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of Crestwood Midstream’s and our common units.Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons, we and Crestwood Midstream will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to you. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from the sale of Crestwood Midstream’s common units and our common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our respective common units or result in audit adjustments to your tax returns.We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.We generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed Treasury Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which a publicly-traded partnership may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferor and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, the proposed regulations do not specifically authorize the use of the proration method we have adopted. If the IRS were to successfully challenge our proration method or new Treasury Regulations were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss, and deduction among our unitholders.43Table of ContentsA unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a “short seller” to cover a short sale of common units) may be considered as having disposed of those common units. If so, he would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.Because there are no specific rules governing the U.S. federal income tax consequences of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units. In that case, he may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller should modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their common units. The sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests within a twelve-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes.We will be considered to have constructively terminated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange within a twelve-month period of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits. For purposes of determining whether the 50% threshold has been met, multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once. Our termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders which could result in us filing two tax returns (and unitholders receiving two Schedule K-1s) for one calendar year. Our termination could also result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a calendar year, the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in its taxable income for the year of termination. Our termination would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, but instead, we would be treated as a new partnership for federal income tax purposes. If treated as a new partnership, we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred. Pursuant to an IRS relief procedure a publicly traded partnership that has technically terminated may request special relief which, if granted by the IRS, among other things, would permit the partnership to provide only a single Schedule K-1 to unitholders for the tax years in which the termination occurs.Our unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states where they do not live as a result of investing in our common units.In addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes, estate, inheritance or intangible taxes and foreign taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property and in which they do not reside. We own property and conduct business in various parts of the United States. Unitholders may be required to file state and local income tax returns in many or all of the jurisdictions in which we do business or own property. Further, unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. It is our unitholders’ responsibility to file all required U. S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns.44Table of ContentsItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.None.
