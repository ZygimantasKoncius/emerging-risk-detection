ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Risk factors specific to the Company relate primarily to the legal proceedings described more fully in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” of this Form 10-K. Other general risk factors that could affect the Company’s future results principally include changes in domestic or international economic conditions, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in the cost of materials used in the manufacture of the Company’s products, changes in death rates, changes in product demand or pricing as a result of consolidation in the industries in which the Company operates, changes in product demand or pricing as a result of domestic or international competitive pressures, unknown risks in connection with the Company's acquisitions, and technological factors beyond the Company's control. In addition, although the Company does not have any customers that would be considered individually significant to consolidated sales, changes in the distribution of the Company’s products or the potential loss of one or more of the Company’s larger customers are also considered risk factors. These factors are also included in this Form 10-K under the caption “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information.” ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. Not Applicable. 10 ITEM
