ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in other documents that we file with the SEC, before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could change. Under these circumstances, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. We have experienced losses and negative cash flow in each of the past five years and expect to incur losses and negative cash flow in 2012. Without additional financing in 2012, it is not likely the Company will be able to continue operations in its current form. We operate in the construction industry, which has been negatively impacted by economic conditions since 2007. As a result, the Company’s sales have continued to decline and the Company’s operations have generated negative cash flows since 2007. As of December 31, 2011, we had a cash balance of $636,000. In 2011, we had negative cash flow of $743,000 which included receipt of $825,000 from settlements of litigation. Without the receipt of such proceeds from the settlement of litigation, our negative cash flow would have been $1,568,000. Unless sales increase in future periods, we will continue to incur negative cash flows and will not have sufficient cash to operate our business over the next 12 months unless we are able to obtain financing. We cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowing or other financings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to fund our needs, if at all. Any curtailment of operations, or reduction or delay in planned capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future revenue prospects. In addition, we are guarantors of certain Just-Rite obligations, including obligations collateralized by assets being sold in the liquidation of that business through the Assignment process, and other obligations related to Just-Rite’s obligations under noncancellable lease agreements. To the extent the proceeds realized from the assets sold are less than the amount of the guaranteed obligations, or the amounts claimed by lessors are in excess of the amounts we have estimated, it will result in a remaining obligation for the Company. At this date, it is uncertain what the amount of any remaining obligation will be after the sale of those collateralized assets, and the final disposition of our guarantee obligations under the leases. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Our business is dependent on demand for construction, renovation and repair of residential and commercial buildings. Such demand is influenced by changes in the overall condition of the U. S. economy including interest rates, job formation, consumer confidence and other important factors. The building products industry is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including, in particular, conditions in the residential and commercial construction markets. Prices for our products and services are affected by overall supply and demand in the market for our products and for our competitors’ products. The recent economic downturn has resulted in a prolonged period of weak demand and excess supply which has negatively affected our revenues and margins and adversely affected our liquidity, financial condition and operating results. Any future economic downturn could have the same effect on us. The markets we serve, principally the residential housing and commercial construction markets, are significantly affected by the movement of interest rates. Significantly higher interest rates or lack of available credit could weaken demand for construction activities, which could lower demand for the Company’s products. Other factors beyond our control may also impact demand for the Company’s products, including, but not limited to new housing starts, which are influenced by availability of financing, housing affordability, demographic trends, employment levels, unforeseen inflationary pressures and consumer confidence. Since our operations occur in limited geographic markets in the Southeast United States, our business is subject to the economic conditions in each such geographic market, particularly in the State of Florida. 5 Beginning in the second quarter of 2006, residential construction demand began to be impacted by a number of factors, including higher interest rates, an increase in available inventory of unsold new and existing homes, and homebuilders reporting lower order rates for new homes. As a consequence, applications for building permits for new residential units, considered a strong sign for future construction activity, began to decline sharply in Florida in the last six months of 2006 and continued through 2009. While there was a modest increase in building permits for the construction of new residential units in Florida during 2010 and 2011, our current business environment remains depressed and we expect general construction activity in our principal trade area to continue to be slow for the foreseeable future. The depth and duration of the decline cannot be predicted. A continued depressed residential and commercial construction market has and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations. Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm issued its report dated March 29, 2012 in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 that included an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. We have taken and are taking several responsive steps, as set forth in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the Form 10-K, that management hopes will be sufficient to allow the Company to continue as a going concern and to improve our operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that such actions will be effective. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Additional adverse changes in economic conditions where we conduct our operations and where prospective customers live could further reduce the demand for our products and, as a result, could further reduce our results of operations and continue to adversely affect our financial condition. Adverse changes in national, regional and local economic conditions where we conduct our operations and where prospective purchasers of our products live, have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business. Adverse changes in employment levels, job growth, consumer confidence, interest rates and population growth, or an oversupply of already constructed homes for sale may further reduce demand and depress prices for our products. These adverse economic conditions could further reduce our results of operations and continue to adversely affect our financial condition. If we are unable to satisfy certain financial obligations assigned to the Assignee which remain outstanding after the sale and liquidation of the underlying collateralized assets, principally certain fixed assets of Just-Rite guaranteed by our parent company, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We remain liable on guarantees of certain obligations of Just-Rite related to specific underlying assets, including noncancellable lease agreements, that were used in Just-Rite’s former operations. To the extent the proceeds derived from the sale of such assets are less than those guaranteed obligations, or the amounts claimed by lessors are in excess of the amounts we have estimated we will be responsible for the short-fall. Such amount of these potential obligations cannot be determined until the assets are sold by the Assignee and the amount of deficiencies remaining to satisfy these obligations arising after said sale, if any, are known. During 2009, we established a loss contingency estimate of $529,000, of which, after subsequent settlement payments have been made for certain of the obligations, $172,000 remains in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011. The accrued loss contingency will continue to be adjusted in future periods as more current information is obtained. The loss of any of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. One customer accounted for 28% and 29% of the Company’s net sales from continuing operations for 2011 and 2010, respectively. This customer’s accounts receivable represented 35% and 23% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Another customer accounted for 12% and 14% of the Company’s net sales from continuing operations for 2011 and 2010, respectively. This customer’s accounts receivable represented 12% and 17% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Although we expect these customers to remain for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain them, or that we would be able to recruit additional key customers to replace the loss of these customers. The loss of these customers, or our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional key customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 6 Our business has substantial fixed costs, and as a result, our operating income is sensitive to changes in net sales. Declines in net sales adversely affect operating results. A significant portion of our expenses are fixed costs, which do not fluctuate with variations in net sales. A decline in net sales is expected to cause a greater proportional decline in operating results. A continuing reduction in net sales could have an unfavorable effect on future operating results due to the negative operating leverage. Our business is subject to intense competition. We experience competition for our products and services from many distributors and manufacturers, including manufacturers that distribute a significant portion of their products through their own distribution organizations. Competition within any given geographic market is based on many factors, including, but not limited to customer classification, product line, product availability, customer service, technical product knowledge and expertise as to application and usage, price, quality and availability of credit. In addition, the barriers to entry for local competitors are relatively low. We may not be able to maintain our costs at a level sufficiently low for us to compete effectively. We may not be successful in responding effectively to competitive pressures, particularly from competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. Our operating results are affected by fluctuations in our costs and the availability of raw materials and building material products from our vendors. Prices of raw materials and building material products are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in product prices may affect sales as well as margins due to a limited ability to pass on short-term price changes. We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge commodity price changes. Our products are currently obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities. However, from time to time it is possible we may experience shortages of building products as a result of unexpected demand or production difficulties as well as transportation limitations. In addition, we purchase products from many vendors under relationships that are terminable without cause or written notice which is customary in our industry. Any disruption in our sources of supply for raw materials or building materials could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If shortages or disruptions in our supply of products from our vendors were to become severe and occur on a more frequent basis in the future, there could be a short-term adverse effect on our operations and a long-term adverse effect on our customer relationships and reputation if we were unable to obtain a sufficient allocation of products from other vendors. In addition, we have strategic relationships with several key vendors. In the event we are unable to maintain these relationships, we could lose some of the competitive advantages that those relationships offer us, which could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to continuing business risk related to insurance coverage. We have been unable to obtain product liability coverage for certain types of product applications since March 15, 2004. Losses from claims in excess of insurance coverage, or for matters not insured, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We carry general liability, comprehensive property damage, workers’ compensation and other insurance coverages for the protection of our assets and operations. There can be no assurance, however, that the coverage limits of such policies will be adequate to cover losses and expenses for lawsuits brought or which may be brought against us. Effective March 15, 2004, we were unable to renew our product liability coverage with coverage for alleged damages caused to building structures because of moisture intrusion due to the use of products formerly manufactured by our subsidiary, DFH, for exterior insulation finish wall systems (“EIFS”), on single and multi-family residences, as well as commercial buildings. While no uninsured lawsuits have been filed against DFH to date, there can be no assurance that this fact will continue in the future. Our subsidiary, Premix, is a defendant (together with our parent Company in certain claims), together with non-affiliated parties, in sixteen claims which allege bodily injury due to exposure to asbestos in products manufactured in excess of thirty (30) years ago. We believe we currently have more than adequate insurance coverage for these asbestos claims and such policies are not subject to self-insured retention. However, losses and expenses in excess of insurance coverage for the EIFS and asbestos product liability claims, as well as any uninsured lawsuits for EIFS product claims, in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. See Item 3. – Legal Proceedings and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in the Report for further discussion of litigation matters. 7 We depend on our senior management team and key personnel for their expertise and leadership. The loss of any member of our senior management could adversely affect our operations. We believe that our ability to implement our business strategy and our continued success will largely depend upon the efforts, skills, abilities and judgment of our executive management team. Our success also depends upon our ability to recruit and retain highly knowledgeable and skilled sales, marketing, operations, finance and other senior managers. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining these employees or in managing our growth successfully, which may in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Because our business is working capital intensive, we rely on our ability to manage our product purchasing and customer credit policies. If we are not successful in managing our working capital, our financial condition would be adversely affected. Our operations are working capital intensive, and our levels of inventories, accounts receivable and accounts payable are significant components of our net asset base. We manage our inventories and accounts payable through purchasing policies and accounts receivable through our customer credit and collection policies. The large majority of our net sales are credit sales through open unsecured accounts with our customers. Our customers’ ability to pay depend, among other things, on the economic strength of the construction industry and regional economies. If we fail to adequately manage our product purchasing or customer credit policies, our working capital and financial condition may be adversely affected. The seasonal nature of our operations may adversely affect our quarterly financial results. Fluctuations in our quarterly results may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Our operating results are somewhat seasonal. Historically, we have experienced lower operating results in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. Seasonal weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, can also delay construction projects, further contributing to quarterly fluctuation in our operating results. If our financial results for a quarter fall below investors’ expectations, the market price of our common stock may decline, perhaps significantly. Implementation of our growth strategy has certain risks. If we are unable to effectively implement or manage our growth strategy, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. As part of our growth strategy, we may add additional product lines or build additional plants. There are certain risks inherent in such growth strategy that could adversely affect our ability to achieve these objectives including, but not limited to the following: · The potential disruption of our business; · The uncertainty that new product lines will generate anticipated sales; · The diversion of resources and management’s time; · The difficulty of managing the operations of a larger company; · The risk of becoming involved in labor, commercial or regulatory disputes or litigation related to the new enterprise; Pursuing our growth strategy may be required for us to remain competitive, but we may not be able to obtain financing, if necessary, to implement such strategy on favorable terms or at all. Future transactions may not improve the competitive position and business prospects as anticipated, and could reduce sales or profit margins, and, therefore, adversely affect our operating results and financial condition if they are not successful. 8 We are subject to environmental and safety regulations that are subject to change. Such regulations could cause us to make modifications to how we manufacture and distribute our products. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety, including laws regulating air emissions, wastewater discharges, the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. If we were to violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could incur fines, penalties or other sanctions. In addition, we could be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials. Environmental laws tend to become more stringent over time, and we could incur significant expenses in the future relating to compliance with future environmental laws. In addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use may vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulation affecting certain of our suppliers. An increase in the price of our raw materials, a decline in their availability or future costs relating to our compliance with environmental laws could negatively affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our financial condition. Natural disasters could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. Future disasters caused by earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, or other similar events could have a significant adverse effect on the general economic and market conditions in our markets, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, natural catastrophes may cause our operating results to fluctuate from time to time due to increased demand or interruption of operations. Our Common Stock is subject to “Penny Stock” rules and these regulations may limit the liquidity of our Common Stock. Our common stock was listed in the NASDAQ Capital Market until January 27, 2010. Since that date our shares have been quoted in the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, under the symbol, “IPII.OB”. The SEC has promulgated rules governing the over the counter trading in penny stocks, defined generally as securities trading below $5 per share that are not quoted on a securities exchange or which do not meet other substantive criteria. Under these rules, our common stock is currently classified as a penny stock. As a penny stock, our common stock is currently subject to rules promulgated by the SEC that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that might sell such securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors. For transactions covered by the rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale. Further, if the price of the stock is below $5 per share and the issuer does not have $2.0 million or more net tangible assets or is not listed on a registered national securities exchange, sales of such stock in the secondary trading market are subject to certain additional rules promulgated by the SEC. These rules generally require, among other things, that brokers engaged in secondary trading of penny stocks provide customers with written disclosure documents, monthly statements of the market value of penny stocks, disclosure of the bid and asked prices, and disclosure of the compensation of the broker-dealer and the salesperson working for the broker-dealer in connection with the transaction. If a trading market for our common stock develops, these rules and regulations may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock, thereby effectively limiting the liquidity of our common stock. These rules may also adversely affect the ability of persons that acquire our common stock to resell their securities in any trading market that may exist at the time of such intended sale. We do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Dividends are payable at the discretion of our Board of Directors. The failure to declare and pay dividends may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, after taking into account various factors, including earnings, capital requirements and surplus, financial position, contractual restrictions and other relevant business considerations. In the future, we may become a party to debt instruments or agreements that further restrict our ability to pay dividends. 9 Actual and perceived vulnerabilities as a result of terrorist activities and armed conflict may adversely impact consumer confidence and our business. Instability in the economy and financial markets as a result of terrorism or war may impact consumer confidence and result in a decrease in residential and commercial construction in our markets. Terrorist attacks may also directly impact our ability to maintain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain anti-takeover provisions may make our stock less attractive to investors. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, as well as Delaware law applicable to our company contain provisions which may delay or prevent other companies from completing transactions in which shareholders may receive a substantial premium for their shares over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions may also limit shareholders’ ability to approve transactions they may otherwise believe are in their best interests. For example, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors and as such is elected for staggered three-year terms. Normally this would make it difficult for another company to succeed in proxy contests to obtain control of the Board. However, as we have not had an annual meeting of stockholders for the last two years, all of our directors, regardless of class, will be up for election at the next annual meeting. The certificate of incorporation also permits the Board of Directors to issue, at any time without shareholder approval, shares of preferred stock, with such terms it may determine in the Board’s discretion. These provisions and others could delay, prevent or allow the Board of Directors to resist an acquisition of our company, even if a majority of the shareholders favor such a transaction. ITEM 1B.
