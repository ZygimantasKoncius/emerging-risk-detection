ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION. THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WE FACE. ADDITIONAL RISKS THAT WE ARE NOT PRESENTLY AWARE OF OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE ARE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BY ANY OR ALL OF THESE RISKS. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO ANY OF THESE RISKS, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. IN ASSESSING THESE RISKS, YOU SHOULD ALSO REFER TO THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES. Competition in each of our markets is intense, and our inability to compete effectively could significantly harm our business and results of operations. We face intense competition in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific for our UC&C solutions products which places pressure on average selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors compete with us in more than one geographic theater and across all of our product categories. Our major global competitor is Cisco Systems. Our other global competitors include Avaya, Blue Jeans Network, Huawei and Logitech. Our competitive landscape continues to rapidly evolve as we move into new markets for video collaboration such as mobile, browser-based, and cloud-delivered video. Our competitors also continue to develop and introduce new technologies, sometimes proprietary, that represent threats through closed architectures, such as Skype, Google Talk/Hangouts, and Apple FaceTime. We also compete with other offerings such as Cisco Systems’ Jabber and WebEx and Citrix Systems’ GoToMeeting with HD Faces. Many of these companies have substantial financial resources and production, marketing, engineering and other capabilities with which to develop, manufacture, market and sell their products, which may result in our having to lower our product prices and increase our spending on marketing, which would correspondingly have a negative impact on our revenues and operating margins.Our principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete include the ability to: provide and sell a broad range of UC&C hardware and software solutions and services, including mobile and cloud-based solutions, and our ability to bring such products to market on a timely basis; competitively price our products and solutions; provide competitive product performance; be successful in multiple markets with differing requirements, including, but not limited to, mobile video, social video, subscription-based video delivered from the cloud and service provider markets, and with various sizes and types of customers; introduce new products and solutions in a timely manner; reduce production and service costs; provide required functionality such as security, reliability, and scalability; ensure investment protection through interoperability and backwards- and forwards-compatibility with other UC&C systems and solutions; continue differentiation through open standards and broad interoperability of our infrastructure in complex environments where integration with other third-party technologies, such as Microsoft Lync, is critical; successfully integrate our products with, and operate our products on, existing customer platforms and consumer devices; gain market presence and brand recognition; extend credit to our partners; conform to open standards; successfully address disruptive technology shifts and new business models, such as cloud-based and software-based UC&C solutions and mobility and consumer solutions; and successfully address the transition in the market from principally hardware based point products to solutions including hardware, software and services. 16 Our competitive environment also differs by geography. Cisco Systems is our primary global competitor in all theaters and categories in which we compete. In the Asia Pacific region, we additionally compete with China-based competitors such as Huawei and ZTE Corporation, as well as Sony Corporation, Zylotech Ltd., ClearOne Communications, Inc., Grandstream Communications, Inc., and other smaller competitors.We may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved performance. New product introductions by our current or future competitors, or our delay in bringing new products to market, could cause a significant decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our products. We believe that ongoing competitive pressure may result in a reduction in the prices of our products and our competitors’ products. In addition, the introduction of additional lower priced competitive products or of new products or product platforms could render our existing products or technologies obsolete. We also believe we will face increasing competition from alternative UC&C solutions that employ new technologies or new combinations of technologies. Further, the commoditization of certain video conferencing products is leading to the availability of alternative, lower-cost UC&C products than ours, such as those offered by Apple, Google, Logitech, Skype and others, which could drive down our sales prices and negatively impact our revenues. Increased consolidation and the formation of strategic partnerships in our industry may lead to increased competition which could adversely affect our business and future results of operations. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions are being formed and announced by our competitors on a regular basis, which increases competition and often results in increased downward pressure on our product prices. For instance, when Cisco Systems acquired Tandberg ASA, previously our largest independent competitor, we had to compete with a larger combined company with significantly greater financial and sales and marketing resources, an extensive channel network and an expanded video communications solutions product line. This product line is often sold in conjunction with Cisco Systems’ proprietary network equipment and technology as a complete solution, making it more difficult for us to compete against them or to ascertain pricing on competitive products. In addition, Cisco Systems may use its dominance in network equipment to foreclose competition in the UC&C solutions market. Cisco Systems may also preclude our competitive products from being fully interoperable with Cisco Systems endpoints, video infrastructure and/or network products. Similarly, Avaya acquired Konftel and RADVISION, and Logitech acquired LifeSize. These consolidations and partnerships have resulted in increased competition and pricing pressure, as the newly-combined entities have greater financial resources, deeper mass market sales channels and greater pricing flexibility than we do. Acquisitions or partnerships made by one of our strategic partners could also limit the potential contribution of our strategic relationships to our business and restrict our ability to form strategic relationships with these companies in the future and, as a result, harm our business. Rumored or actual consolidation of our partners and competitors will likely cause uncertainty and disruption to our business and can cause our stock price to fluctuate. Global economic conditions have adversely affected our business in the past and could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business in the future. Adverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries and have caused a negative impact on the specific segments and markets in which we operate. As our business has grown, we have become increasingly exposed to adverse changes in general global economic conditions, which can result in reductions in capital expenditures by end-user customers for our products, longer sales cycles, the deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased competition. These factors have adversely impacted our operating results in prior periods and could also impact us again in the future. Global economic concerns, such as the varying pace of global economic recovery and European and domestic debt and budget issues, continue to create uncertainty and unpredictability that have contributed to longer selling cycles and cause us to continue to be cautious about our future outlook, including our near-term revenue and profitability outlook. For example, we have recently seen weakening demand and longer sales cycles in the public sector, which includes federal, state and local governments, as well as healthcare and education, which we believe were due in large part to budget constraints, as well as political issues. A global economic downturn would negatively impact technology spending for our products and services and would materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, we have recently seen slower growth than we anticipated in China, India, and other growth markets, which we believe is due in part to macro-economic factors. Further, global economic conditions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity levels in many financial markets, decrease in customer demand and ability to pay obligations, and extreme volatility in credit, equity, foreign currency and fixed income markets. These adverse economic conditions could negatively impact our business, particularly our revenue potential, losses on investments and the collectability of our accounts receivable, due to the inability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services, customer or partner insolvencies or bankruptcies, decreased customer confidence to make purchasing decisions resulting in delays in their purchasing decisions, and decreased customer demand or demand for lower-end products. 17 Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and are not necessarily a good indicator of future performance. Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly in the future as a result of a number of factors, many of which are out of our control or can be difficult to predict. These factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in demand for our products and services, in part due to uncertain global economic conditions and increased competition, as well as transitions in the markets in which we sell products and services; our ability to execute on our strategic and operating plans; changes to our global organization and retention of key personnel; slowing sales or variations in sales rates by our channel partners to their customers; changes to our channel partner programs, contracts and strategy that could result in a reduction in the number of channel partners, could adversely impact our revenues and gross margins as we realign our discount and rebate programs for our channels, or could cause more of our channel partners to add our competitors’ products to their portfolio; the prices and performance of our products and those of our existing or potential new competitors; the timing, size and mix of the orders for our products; the level and mix of inventory that we hold to meet future demand; changes in effective tax rates which are difficult to predict due to, among other things, the timing and geographical mix of our earnings, the outcome of current or future tax audits and potential new rules and regulations; changes in the underlying factors and assumptions used in determining stock-based compensation; fluctuations in the level of international sales and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on both revenues and expenses; dependence on component suppliers and third party manufacturers, which includes outside development manufacturers, and the associated manufacturing costs; the impact of increasing costs of freight and components used in the manufacturing of our products and the potential negative impact on our gross margins; the magnitude of any costs that we must incur in the event of a product recall or of costs associated with product warranty claims; the impact of seasonality on our various product lines and geographic regions; and adverse outcomes in intellectual property litigation and other matters and the costs associated with asserting and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio. As a result of these and potentially other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not necessarily a good predictor of our future performance. If our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market securities analysts or investors, or below any financial guidance we may provide to the market, our stock price will likely decline. Financial guidance beyond the current quarter is inherently subject to greater risk and uncertainty, and if the transitions in our markets accelerate, our ability to forecast becomes more difficult. We face risks associated with developing and marketing our products, including new product development and new product lines. Our success depends on our ability to assimilate new technologies in our products and to properly train our channel partners, sales force and end-user customers in the use of those products. The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, such as the demand for HD video technology and lower cost video infrastructure products, the shift from on premise-based equipment to a mix of solutions that includes hardware and software and the option for customers to have video delivered as a service from the cloud or through a browser, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, including an increased emphasis on software products and new, lower cost hardware products. Historically, our focus has been on premise-based solutions for the enterprise and public sector, targeted at vertical markets, including finance, manufacturing, government, education and healthcare. In addition, in response to emerging market trends, and the network effect driven by business-to-business and business-to-consumer adoption of UC&C, we are expanding our focus to capture opportunities within emerging markets including mobile, SMBs, and cloud-based delivery. If we are unable to successfully capture these markets to the extent anticipated, or to develop the new technologies and partnerships required to successfully compete in these markets, then our revenues may not grow as anticipated and our business may ultimately be harmed. Given the competitive 18 nature of the mobile industry, changing end user behaviors and other industry dynamics, these relationships may not evolve into fully-developed product offerings or translate into any future revenues. The success of our new products depends on several factors, including proper new product definition, product cost, infrastructure for services and cloud delivery, timely completion and introduction of new products, proper positioning and pricing of new products in relation to our total product portfolio and their relative pricing, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and other products in our own portfolio, market acceptance of these products and the ability to sell our products to customers as comprehensive UC&C solutions. Other factors that may affect our success include properly addressing the complexities associated with compatibility issues, channel partner and sales force training, technical and sales support, and field support. In addition, we are making additional investments to deliver cloud-based and mobile UC&C solutions, and we continue to invest in immersive telepresence solutions. Ultimately, it is possible that our increased investments in these areas may not yield the planned financial results. In addition, in our high-end UC&C solutions, such as immersive telepresence, that typically require direct high touch sales involvement with potential customers, we compete directly with large, multi-national corporations, such as Cisco Systems, who have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, and executive resources than we do, as well as greater name recognition and market presence with many potential customers. We also need to continually educate and train our channel partners to avoid any confusion as to the desirability of new product offerings and solutions compared to our existing product offerings and to be able to articulate and differentiate the value of new offerings over those of our competitors. As the market evolves, our distribution model and channel partners may change as well. During the last few years, we launched several new product offerings, including new software, hardware and cloud-based solutions, and these new products could cause confusion among our channel partners and end-users, thereby causing them to delay purchases of our new products until they determine their market acceptance, or as they consider a more comprehensive UC&C strategy versus point product or endpoint only deployments. Any delays in future purchases could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and operating results in the period of the delay. The shift in communications from circuit-switched to IP-based and other new technologies over time may require us to add new channel partners, enter new markets and gain new core technological competencies. We are attempting to address these needs and the need to develop new products through our internal development efforts, through joint developments with other companies and through acquisitions. However, we may not identify successful new product opportunities and develop and bring products to market in a timely manner. Further, as we introduce new products, these product transition cycles may not go smoothly, causing an increased risk of inventory obsolescence and relationship issues with our end-user customers and channel partners. The failure of our new product development efforts, any inability to service or maintain the necessary third-party interoperability licenses, our inability to properly manage product transitions or to anticipate new product demand, or our inability to enter new markets would harm our business and results of operations. We may experience delays in product introductions and availability, and our products may contain defects which could seriously harm our results of operations. We have experienced delays in the introduction of certain new products and enhancements in the past. The delays in product release dates that we experienced in the past have been due to factors such as unforeseen technology issues, manufacturing ramping issues and other factors, which we believe negatively impacted our sales revenue in the relevant periods. Any of these or other factors may occur again and delay our future product releases. Our product development groups are dispersed throughout the United States and other international locations such as China, India and Israel. As such, disruption due to geopolitical conflicts could create an increased risk of delays in new product introductions. We produce highly complex communications equipment, which includes both hardware and software and incorporates new technologies and component parts from different suppliers. Resolving product defect and technology and quality issues could cause delays in new product introduction. Component part shortages could also cause delays in product delivery and lead to increased costs. Further, some defects may not be detected or cured prior to a new product launch, or may be detected after a product has already been launched and may be incurable or result in a product recall. The occurrence of any of these events could result in the failure of a partial or entire product line or a withdrawal of a product from the market. We may also have to invest significant capital and other resources to correct these problems, including product reengineering expenses and inventory, warranty and replacement costs. These problems might also result in claims against us by our customers or others and could harm our reputation and adversely affect future sales of our products. Any delays for new product offerings currently under development, including product offerings for mobile, cloud-based delivery, software delivery or any product quality issues, product defect issues or product recalls could adversely affect the market acceptance of these products, our ability to compete effectively in the market, and our reputation with our customers, and therefore could lead to decreased product sales and could harm our business. We may also experience cancellation of orders, difficulty in 19 collecting accounts receivable, increased service and warranty costs in excess of our estimates, diversion of resources and increased insurance costs and other losses to our business or to end-user customers. Product obsolescence or discontinuance and excess inventory can negatively affect our results of operations. The pace of change in technology development and in the release of new products has increased and is expected to continue to increase, which can often render existing or developing technologies obsolete. In addition, the introduction of new products and any related actions to discontinue existing products can cause existing inventory to become obsolete. These obsolescence issues, or any failure by us to properly anticipate product life cycles, can require write-downs in inventory value. For each of our products, the potential exists for new products to render existing products obsolete, cause inventories of existing products to increase, cause us to discontinue a product or reduce the demand for existing products. Further, we continually evaluate our product lines both strategically and in terms of potential growth rates and margins. Such evaluations could result in the discontinuance or divestiture of those products in the future, which could be disruptive and costly and may not yield the intended benefits. For example, we divested our enterprise wireless solutions business in December 2012. We face risks related to the adoption rate of new technologies. We have invested significant resources developing products that are dependent on the adoption rate of new technologies. For example, our Polycom® RealPresence® One and Real Presence Virtual Edition platform software solutions are dependent on enterprise adoption of software based video bridging applications. If the software related video bridging market does not grow as we anticipate, or if our strategy for addressing the market, or execution of such strategy, is not successful, our business and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, we develop new products or make product enhancements based upon anticipated demand for new features and functionality. Our business and revenues may be harmed if the use of new technologies that our future products are based on does not occur; if we do not anticipate shifts in technology appropriately or rapidly enough; if the development of suitable sales channels does not occur, or occurs more slowly than expected; if our products are not priced competitively or are not readily adopted; or if the adoption rates of such new technologies do not drive demand for our other products as we anticipate. For example, although we believe increased sales of UC&C solutions will drive increased demand for our UC hardware and software platform products, such increased demand may not occur or we may not benefit to the same extent as our competitors. We also may not be successful in creating demand in our installed customer base for products that we develop that incorporate new technologies or features. Conversely, as we see the adoption rate of new technologies increase, product sales of our legacy products may be negatively impacted, which could materially impact our revenues and results of operations. Lower than expected market acceptance of our products, price competition and other price changes would negatively impact our business. If the market does not accept our products, particularly our new product offerings on which we are relying on for future revenues, such as product offerings for platform software, new hardware products and cloud-based delivery, our business and operating results would be harmed. Further, revenues relating to new product offerings are unpredictable, and new products typically have lower gross margins for a period of time after their introduction and higher marketing and sales costs. As we introduce new products, they could increasingly become a higher percentage of our revenues. Our profitability could also be negatively affected in the future as a result of continuing competitive price pressures in the sale of UC&C solutions equipment and UC platform products. Further, in the past we have reduced prices in order to expand the market for our products, and in the future, we may further reduce prices, introduce new products that carry lower margins in order to expand the market or stimulate demand for our products, or discontinue existing products as a means of stimulating growth in a new product. Finally, if we do not fully anticipate, understand and fulfill the needs of end-user customers in the vertical markets that we serve, we may not be able to fully capitalize on product sales into those vertical markets and our revenues may, accordingly, fail to grow as anticipated or may be adversely impacted. We face similar risks as we expand and focus our business on the SMB and service provider markets. Failure to adequately service and support our product offerings could harm our results of operations. The increasing complexity of our products and associated technologies has increased the need for enhanced product warranty and service capabilities, including integration services, which may require us to develop or acquire additional advanced service capabilities and make additional investments. If we cannot adequately develop and train our internal support organization or maintain our relationships with our outside technical support providers, it could adversely affect our business. In addition, sales of our immersive telepresence solutions are complex sales transactions, and the end-user customer typically purchases an enhanced level of support service from us so as to ensure that its significant investment can be fully operational and realized. This requires us to provide advanced services and project management in terms of resources and technical knowledge of the 20 customer’s telecommunication network. If we are unable to provide the proper level of support on a cost efficient basis, it may cause damage to our reputation in this market and may harm our business and results of operations. If we fail to successfully attract and retain highly qualified management personnel and key employees, our business may be harmed. Our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate and retain highly qualified senior executives and other key management personnel. As new hires assess their areas of responsibilities and define their organizations, disruption to the business and additional organizational changes or restructuring actions and charges could occur. In the last 12 to 18 months we have had turnover in a number of senior executive positions, including our chief executive officer, our head of worldwide sales, our chief marketing officer and head of worldwide engineering. In December 2013, we appointed a new CEO. This transition, along with the hiring of other new senior managers, may be disruptive to our business, and if we are unable to execute an orderly transition, our revenue, operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted. Future changes to our executive and senior management teams, including new executive hires or departures, could cause further disruption to the business and have a negative impact on our operating performance, while these operational areas are in transition. Competition for qualified executive and other management personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. Impairment of our goodwill or other assets would negatively affect our results of operations. As of December 31, 2013, our goodwill was approximately $559.5 million and other purchased intangible assets were approximately $37.5 million, which together represent a significant portion of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or sooner under certain circumstances. Other intangible assets that are deemed to have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but must be reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred requires significant judgment. Therefore, we may be required to take a charge to operations as a result of future goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests. The decreases in revenue and stock price that have occurred as a result of global economic factors make such impairment more likely to result. If impairment is deemed to exist, we would write-down the recorded value of these intangible assets to their fair values and these write-downs could harm our business and results of operations. Further, we cannot assure you that future inventory, investment, license, fixed asset or other asset write-downs will not happen. If future write-downs do occur, they could harm our business and results of operations. Difficulties in identifying and integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business. We have spent and may continue to spend significant resources identifying and acquiring businesses. The process of identifying suitable candidates and integrating acquired companies into our operations requires significant resources and is time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to our business. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions could harm our business, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we may incur material charges in future quarters to reflect additional costs associated with any future acquisition we may make. We may not realize the benefits we anticipate from our acquisitions because of the following significant challenges: incorporating the acquired company’s technology and products and services into our current and future product lines, including providing services that are new for us; potential deterioration of the acquired company’s product sales and revenues due to integration activities and management distraction; managing integration issues; potentially creating confusion in the marketplace by ineffectively distinguishing or marketing the product and services offerings of the newly acquired company with our existing product and services lines; entering new businesses or product lines; potentially incompatible cultural differences between the two companies; geographic dispersion of operations; interruption of manufacturing operations as we transition an acquired company’s manufacturing to our outsourced manufacturing model; generating marketing demand for an expanded product line; distraction of the existing and acquired sales force during the integration of the companies; 21 distraction of and potential conflict with the acquired company’s products and services in regards to our existing channel partners; the difficulty in leveraging the combined technologies and capabilities across all product lines and customer bases; and our inability to retain the customers or employees of an acquired company. Our failure to successfully implement restructuring plans related to vacant and redundant facilities could adversely impact our business. We have in the past, and may in the future, as part of acquiring a company or as part of restructuring actions taken to streamline the business, identify redundant facilities. If we identify redundant facilities, we would develop a plan to exit as part of the integration of the acquired business or as part of the implementation of the restructuring plan. Any reserve would be net of estimated sublease income we expect to generate. Our estimate of sublease income is based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets. If actual sublease income is lower than our estimates for any reason, if it takes us longer than we estimated to sublease these facilities, or if the associated cost of, or our recorded liability related to, subleasing or terminating our lease obligations for these facilities is greater than we estimated, we would incur additional charges to operations which would harm our business, results of operations and cash flows. We experience seasonal demand for our products and services, which may adversely impact our results of operations during certain periods. Sales of some of our products have experienced seasonal fluctuations which have affected sequential growth rates for these products, particularly in our first and third quarters. For example, the first quarter of the year is typically the least predictable quarter of the year for us and there is generally a slowdown for sales of our products in the European region in the third quarter of each year. Further, the timing of fiscal year ends for our government and enterprise customers may result in significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter. Seasonal fluctuations could negatively affect our business, which could cause our operating results to fall short of anticipated results for such quarters. Our operating results are hard to predict as a significant amount of our sales may occur at the end of a quarter and certain of our service provider contracts include contractual acceptance provisions. The timing of our channel partner orders and product shipments and our inability to reduce expenses quickly may adversely impact our operating results. Our quarterly revenues and operating results depend in large part upon the volume and timing of channel partner orders received during a given quarter and the percentage of each order that we are able to ship and recognize as revenue during each quarter, each of which is extremely difficult to forecast. We have experienced longer sales cycles in connection with our high-end UC&C solutions, which could also increase the level of unpredictability and fluctuation in the timing of orders. Further, depending upon the complexity of these solutions, such as immersive telepresence and some UC platform products, and the underlying contractual terms, revenue may not be recognized until the product has been accepted by the end-user, resulting in further revenue unpredictability. Our expectations for both short and long-term future revenues are based almost exclusively on our own estimate of future demand and not on firm channel partner orders. Our expense levels are based largely on these estimates. In addition, a significant portion of our product orders are received in the last month of a quarter, typically the last few weeks of that quarter; thus, the unpredictability of the receipt of these orders could negatively impact our future results. For instance, we have experienced a high percentage of our bookings and resulting revenues in the third month of the quarter. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2013, approximately 50% of our quarterly revenues were recognized in the third month of the quarter. Accordingly, if for any reason orders and revenues do not meet our expectations in a particular period, we will be limited in our ability to reduce expenses quickly, and any significant shortfall in demand for our products in relation to our expectations would have an adverse impact on our operating results. Delays in receiving contractual acceptance will cause delays in our ability to recognize revenue and may impact our quarterly revenues, depending upon the timing and shipment of orders under such contracts. Certain of our sales contracts include product acceptance provisions which vary depending upon the type of product and individual terms of the contract. In addition, acceptance criteria may be required in other contracts in the future, depending upon the size and complexity of the sale and the type of products ordered. As we increase our focus on growing our service provider business and cloud and managed services, it is likely that an increased amount of our revenue will be subject to such contractual acceptance terms and milestones, and we may introduce new revenue models that could result in less revenue being recognized upfront. Accordingly, we defer revenue until the underlying acceptance criteria in any given contract have been met. Depending upon the acceptance terms, the timing of the receipt and subsequent shipment of an order may result in acceptance delays, may reduce the predictability of our revenues, and, consequently, may adversely impact our revenues and results of operations in any particular quarter. 22 We face risks related to our dependence on channel partners to sell our products. Conflicts and competition with our channel partners and strategic partners could hurt sales of our products. We have OEM agreements with major telecommunications equipment manufacturers, such as Avaya and Cisco Systems, whereby we manufacture our products to work with the equipment of the OEM. These relationships can create conflicts with our other channel partners who directly compete with our OEM partners, or could create conflicts among our OEM partners who compete with each other, which could adversely affect revenues from these other channel partners or our OEM partners. Conflicts among our OEM partners could also make continued partnering with these OEM partners increasingly difficult. Our OEM partners may decide to enter into a new OEM partnership with a company other than us, or develop products of their own, or acquire such products through acquisition, that compete with ours in the future, which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. For example, Cisco Systems has informed us that it will end of life, and will therefore no longer resell, the IP conference phones they purchase from us, which is expected to reduce our 2014 revenue by approximately $40.0 million compared to 2013. Because many of our channel partners also sell equipment that competes with our products, these channel partners could devote more attention to these other products which could harm our business. Further, as a result of our more direct-touch sales model, we may alienate some of our channel partners or cause a shift in product sales from our traditional channel model. Due to these and other factors, channel conflicts could arise which cause channel partners to devote resources to non-Polycom communications equipment, or to offer new products from our competitors, which would negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we are focusing on our strategic partnerships and alliances with Microsoft, AT&T, BroadSoft and IBM. Defining, managing and developing these partnerships is expensive and time-consuming and may not come to fruition or yield the desired results, impacting our ability to effectively compete in the market and to take advantage of anticipated future market growth. For example, our key strategic relationship with Microsoft in which we are jointly developing and marketing a UC&C solution that leverages the demand for Microsoft’s next generation UC server could negatively impact our ability to compete effectively in the UC&C marketplace if we are unsuccessful. Our mobile solutions are also dependent on our ability to successfully partner with mobile device manufacturers. In addition, as we enter into agreements with these strategic partners to enable us to continue to expand our relationships with these partners, we may undertake additional obligations, such as development efforts, which could trigger unintended penalty or other provisions in the event that we fail to fully perform our contractual commitments or could result in additional costs beyond those that are planned in order to meet these contractual obligations. As we continue to build strategic partnerships with companies, conflicts between our strategic partners could arise which could harm our business. Some of our current and future products are directly competitive with the products sold by both our channel and strategic partners. As a result of these conflicts, there is the potential for our channel and strategic partners to compete head-to-head with us or to significantly reduce or eliminate their orders of our products or design our technology out of their products. Further, some of our products are reliant on strategic partnerships with call manager providers and wireless UC&C platform providers. These partnerships result in interoperable features between products to deliver a total solution to our mutual end-user customers. Competition with our partners in all of the markets in which we operate is likely to increase, which would adversely affect our revenues and could potentially strain our existing relationships with these companies. We are subject to risks associated with our channel partners’ sales reporting, product inventories and product sell-through. We sell a significant amount of our products to channel partners who maintain their own inventory of our products for sale to dealers and end-users. Our revenue estimates associated with products stocked by some of our channel partners are based largely on end-user sales reports that our channel partners provide to us on a monthly basis. To date, we believe this data has been generally accurate. To the extent that this sales-out and channel inventory data is inaccurate or not received timely, our revenue estimates for future periods may be less reliable. Further, if these channel partners are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products in a given quarter or if channel partners decide to decrease their inventories for any reason, such as a recurrence of global economic uncertainty and downturn in technology spending, the volume of our sales to these channel partners and our revenues would be negatively affected. In addition, we also face the risk that some of our channel partners have inventory levels in excess of future anticipated sales. If such sales do not occur in the time frame anticipated by these channel partners for any reason, these channel partners may substantially decrease the amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods, or product returns may exceed historical or predicted levels, which would harm our business and create unexpected variations in our financial results. 23 Potential changes to our channel partner programs or channel partner contracts may not be favorably received and as a result our channel partner relationships and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Our channel partners are eligible to participate in various incentive programs, depending upon their contractual arrangements with us. As part of these arrangements, we have the right to make changes in our programs and launch new programs as business conditions warrant. Further, from time to time, we may make changes to our channel partner contracts. These changes could upset our channel partners with the effect that they could add competitive products to their portfolios, delay advertising or sales of our products, or shift more emphasis to selling our competitors’ products. Our channel partners may not be receptive to future changes and we may not receive the positive benefits that we anticipate in making any program and contractual changes. Consolidation of our channel partners and strategic partners may result in changes to our overall business relationships, less favorable contractual terms and disruption to our business. We have seen consolidation among certain of our existing channel partners and strategic partners. In such instances, we may experience changes to our overall business and operational relationships due to dealing with a larger combined entity, and our ability to maintain such relationships on favorable contractual terms may be limited. Depending on the extent of these changes and other disruptions caused to the combined businesses during the integration period, the timing and extent of revenue from these channel partners may be adversely affected. We are subject to risks associated with the success of the businesses of our channel partners. Many of our channel partners that carry multiple Polycom products, and from whom we derive significant revenues, are thinly capitalized. Although we perform ongoing evaluations of the creditworthiness of our channel partners, the failure of these businesses to establish and sustain profitability, obtain financing or adequately fund capital expenditures could have a significant negative effect on our future revenue levels and profitability and our ability to collect our receivables. As we grow our revenues and our customer base, our exposure to credit risk increases. In addition, global economic uncertainty, reductions in technology spending in the United States and other countries, and the ongoing challenges in the financial services industry have restricted the availability of capital, which may delay collections from our channel partners beyond our historical experience or may cause companies to file for bankruptcy, jeopardizing the collectability of our receivables from such channel partners and negatively impacting our future results. Our channel partner contracts are typically short-term and early termination of these contracts may harm our results of operations. We do not typically enter into long-term contracts with our channel partners, and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our channel partners. In the event of a termination by one of our major channel partners, we believe that the end-user customer would likely purchase from another one of our channel partners, but if this did not occur and we were unable to rapidly replace that revenue source, its loss would harm our results of operations. If our channel partners fail to comply with laws or standards, our business could be harmed. We expect our channel partners to meet certain standards of conduct and to comply with applicable laws, such as global anticorruption laws. Noncompliance with such standards or laws could harm our reputation and could result in harm to our business and results of operations in the event we were to become involved in an investigation due to such noncompliance by a channel partner. International sales and expenses represent a significant portion of our revenues and operating expenses and risks inherent in international operations could harm our business. International sales and expenses represent a significant portion of our revenues and operating expenses, and we anticipate that international sales and operating expenses will continue to increase. In 2013, international revenues represented 57% of our total revenues. International sales and expenses are subject to certain inherent risks, which would be amplified if our international business grows as anticipated, including the following: adverse economic conditions in international markets, such as the restricted credit environment and sovereign credit concerns in EMEA and the recent reduced government spending and elongated sales cycles we have seen in China;information security, environmental and trade protection measures and other legal and regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products, to export our products from, or sell our products in various countries; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including the recent volatility of the U.S. dollar, and the impact of our underlying hedging programs; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs; 24 longer payment cycles; cash repatriation restrictions;potentially adverse tax consequences; and the impact of instability in the Middle East or military action or other hostilities on foreign markets. International revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in the future as we introduce new products. These fluctuations are primarily the result of our practice of introducing new products in North America first and the additional time and costs required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets. To the extent we are unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. We may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products. Although to date, a substantial majority of our international sales have been denominated in U.S. currency, we expect that a growing number of sales will be denominated in non-U.S. currencies as more international customers request billing in their currency. We maintain local currency pricing in the European Union and the United Kingdom whereby we price and invoice our products and services in Euros and British Pounds. In addition, some of our competitors currently invoice in foreign currency, which could be a disadvantage to us in those markets where we do not. Our international operating expenses are primarily denominated in foreign currency with no offsetting revenues in those currencies except for the Euro and British Pound. As a result of these factors, we expect our business will be vulnerable to currency fluctuations, which could adversely impact our revenues and margins. We will continue to evaluate whether it is necessary to denominate sales in local currencies other than the Euro and the British Pound, depending on customer requirements. We do not hedge for speculative purposes. As a result of our increased exposure to currency fluctuations, we typically engage in currency hedging activities to mitigate currency fluctuation exposure. Our hedging costs can vary depending upon the size of our hedge program, whether we are purchasing or selling foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar and interest rates spreads between the U.S. and other foreign markets. As a result, interest and other income (expense), net has become less predictable and more difficult to forecast. The impact in any given quarter of our hedging programs is dependent upon a number of factors, including the actual level of foreign currency denominated revenues, the percentage of actual revenues covered by our hedge contracts, the exchange rate in our underlying hedge contracts and the actual exchange rate during the quarter. As a result of our program, we increased operating income by $3.7 million in fiscal year 2012 and by $2.3 million in fiscal year 2013. For further information on our hedging program, see the section entitled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” We continue to look for ways to improve and streamline our infrastructure, including implementing a new integrated financial information system and other information technology and processes, and if we do not appropriately manage these implementations, our operating results may be negatively affected. To manage our business effectively, we must continue to improve and streamline our infrastructure, including information technology and processes, financial operating and administrative systems and controls in an efficient manner. We plan to continue to improve our information technology systems and underlying business processes, which will require significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with implementing new systems that may affect our ability to manage our data. If we do not successfully implement, improve or maintain these systems, our operations may be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed. In addition, these systems or their functionality may not operate as we expect them to, and we may be required to expend significant resources to correct problems or find alternative sources for performing these functions, which makes our ability to forecast and effectively control our operating expenses more challenging. For example, as part of our effort to improve efficiencies throughout our worldwide organization, we have begun the implementation of a new integrated financial information system. This implementation is expected to be completed in two phases with the financial accounting processes being implemented in the third quarter of 2014 and the operations components in early 2015. The successful conversion from our legacy financial systems to a new integrated financial information system entails a number of risks due to the complexity of the conversion and implementation process. There can be no assurance that the conversion to, and the implementation of, the new financial information system will not impede our ability to receive and process orders and accurately and timely prepare, analyze and report the financial data we use in making operating decisions and which form the basis of the financial information we include in the periodic reports we file with the SEC.We also have a Shared Services Center (“SSC”) in Beijing, China, where we perform certain accounting, order entry and other functions previously performed in regional headquarter locations, and we may expand our SSC operations in the future. Efforts to globalize these shared functions into one location may not yield the intended benefits and could result in higher turnover than planned, which could have an adverse effect on these functions during the transition. In addition, if the controls we put in place with respect to the SSC fail to operate effectively, our business and results of operations could be harmed.25 We have limited supply sources for some key components of our products and services and for the outside development and manufacture of certain of our products, and our operations could be harmed by supply or service interruptions, component defects or unavailability of these components or products. Some key components used in our products are currently available from only one source and others are available from only a limited number of sources, including some key integrated circuits and optical elements. Because of such limited sources for component parts, we may have little or no ability to procure these parts on favorable pricing terms. We also obtain certain components from suppliers in China, Japan, and certain Southeast Asia countries, and any political or economic instability in these regions in the future, natural disasters, disruptions associated with infectious diseases, or future import restrictions, may cause delays or an inability to obtain these supplies. Further, we have suppliers in Israel and any military action or war with other Middle Eastern countries perceived as a threat by the United States government may cause delays or an inability to obtain supplies for our UC platform products. We have no raw material supply commitments from our suppliers and generally purchase components on a purchase order basis either directly or through our contract manufacturers. Some of the components included in our products, such as microprocessors and other integrated circuits, have been subject to limited allocations by suppliers. Component manufacturers may also announce the end of production of certain components that we require for our products necessitating the redesign and end of life purchases on our part. In addition, companies with limited or uncertain financial resources manufacture some of these components. Further, we do not always have direct control over the supply chain, as many of our component parts are procured for us by our contract manufacturers. In the event that we, or our contract manufacturers, are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of components, develop alternative sources as needed, or companies with limited financial resources go out of business, our operating results could be seriously harmed. In addition, we may incur additional costs to resolve these supply shortages, which would negatively impact our gross margins. We have strategic relationships with third parties to develop and manufacture certain products for us. The loss of any such strategic relationship due to competitive reasons, contractual disputes, the financial instability of a strategic partner or their inability to obtain any financing necessary to adequately fund their operations, could have a negative impact on our ability to produce and sell certain products and product lines and, consequently, would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. We are also dependent upon third parties to provide our managed services for our immersive telepresence products. Any disruption in our managed services for our customers may materially adversely affect our ability to sell our immersive telepresence products and impact our relationship with the end users. Additionally, our HDX solutions and network system products are designed based on digital signal processors and integrated circuits produced by Texas Instruments and cameras produced by JVC. If we could no longer obtain integrated circuits or cameras from these suppliers, we would incur substantial expense and take substantial time in redesigning our products to be compatible with components from other manufacturers, and we might not be successful in obtaining these components from alternative sources in a timely or cost-effective manner. The failure to obtain adequate supplies of vital components could prevent or delay product shipments, which would harm our business. We also rely on the introduction schedules of some key components in the development or launch of new products. Any delays in the availability of these key components could harm our business. Our operating results would be seriously harmed by receipt of a significant number of defective components or components that fail to fully comply with environmental or other regulatory requirements, an increase in component prices, or our inability to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive price reductions. If we experience manufacturing disruptions or capacity constraints or our manufacturers fail to comply with laws or standards, our business would be harmed. We subcontract the manufacture of most of our products to Celestica, Askey, Foxconn and VTech, which are all third-party contract manufacturers. We use Celestica’s facilities in Thailand and China and Askey’s, Foxconn’s, and VTech’s facilities in China. Should there be any disruption in the ability of these third party manufacturers to conduct business for any reason, our business and results of operations would be harmed. While we have begun to develop secondary manufacturing sources for certain products, Celestica’s facilities are currently the manufacturer for substantially all of these products, and if Celestica experiences an interruption in operations, suffers from capacity constraints, or is otherwise unable to meet our current or future production requirements we would experience a delay or inability to ship our products, which would have an immediate negative impact on our revenues. Moreover, any incapacitation of any of our or our subcontractors’ manufacturing sites due to destruction, natural disaster or similar events could result in a loss of product inventory. As a result of any of the foregoing, we may not be able to meet demand for our products, which could negatively affect revenues in the quarter of the disruption or longer depending upon the magnitude of the event, and could harm our reputation. In addition, operating in the international environment exposes us to certain inherent risks, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences, all of which could harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we expect our contractors to meet certain standards of conduct, including standards related to the environment, health and safety, general working conditions, and compliance with laws. Significant or continuing noncompliance of such standards 26 or applicable laws could harm our reputation or cause us to experience disruptions that could harm our business and results of operations. For example, the SEC has adopted rules imposing diligence and disclosure requirements around the use of “conflict minerals” in the products we have manufactured. These rules will result in additional time and cost to diligence our contractors and comply with the disclosure requirements and they may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals we use in our products. Although we do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on these rules, we will need to ensure that our contractors comply with them. We have outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, and may incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results. As of December 31, 2013, we had $248.4 million in term loans outstanding under our credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business; for example, it could: require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate; limit, along with the restrictive covenants contained in the credit agreement, our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms we find acceptable; place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt; and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, financial, industry or competitive conditions, including increases in interest rates. In addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify. Our credit facility contains covenants which may adversely impact our business, and the failure to comply with such covenants could cause our outstanding debt to become immediately payable. The Credit Agreement includes a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict us and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, grant liens, make investments, incur indebtedness, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make acquisitions, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock, enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. We are also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a consolidated secured leverage ratio. Collectively, these covenants could constrain our ability to grow our business through acquisition or engage in other transactions. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes customary events of default that include, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, cross default to material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, material judgment defaults, ERISA defaults and a change of control default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit Agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to conduct our business. Changing laws and increasingly complex corporate governance and public disclosure requirements could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Changing laws, regulations and standards, including those relating to corporate governance, social/environmental responsibility, anticorruption and public disclosure and newly enacted SEC regulations, have created additional compliance requirements for us. Our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in an increase in expenses and a diversion of management’s time from other business activities. While we believe we are compliant with laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we do business, we must continue to monitor and assess our compliance in the future, and we must also continue to expand our compliance procedures. Any failures in these procedures in the future could result in time-consuming and costly activities, potential fines and penalties, and diversion of management time, all of which could hurt our business. Our products and services are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations. Compliance with current laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition. However, new laws and regulations or new or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations could deny or delay our access to certain markets or require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 27 The telecommunications industry is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States and similar government agencies in other countries and is subject to changing political, economic, and regulatory influences. Changes in telecommunications requirements, or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate now or in the future, in the United States or other countries could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, including our managed services offering. Further, changes in the regulation of our activities, such as increased or decreased regulation affecting prices, could also have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. If we have insufficient proprietary rights or if we fail to protect those rights we have, our business could be materially impaired. We rely on third-party license agreements and termination or impairment of these agreements may cause delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments which could harm our business. We have licensing agreements with various suppliers for software incorporated into our products. In addition, certain of our products are developed and manufactured based largely or solely on third-party technology. These third-party software licenses and arrangements may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable or competitive terms, if at all. The termination or impairment of these licenses could result in delays or reductions in new product introductions or current product shipments until equivalent software could be developed, licensed and integrated, which could harm our business and results of operations. Further, if we are unable to obtain necessary technology licenses on commercially reasonable or competitive terms, we could be prohibited from marketing our products, forced to market products without certain features, or incur substantial costs to redesign our products, defend legal actions, or pay damages. In addition, some of our products may include “open source” software. Our ability to commercialize products or technologies incorporating open source software may be restricted because, among other factors, open source license terms may be unclear and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our product offerings. We rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary rights. Others may independently develop similar proprietary information and techniques or gain access to our intellectual property rights or disclose such technology. In addition, we cannot assure you that any patent or registered trademark owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the U.S. or foreign countries or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all. Furthermore, others may develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents. In addition, foreign intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity of and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could harm our business, and we could ultimately be unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property rights. Further, our intellectual property protection controls across our global operations may not be adequate to fully protect us from the theft or misappropriation of our intellectual property, which could adversely harm our business. We face litigation claims that might be costly to resolve and, if resolved adversely, may harm our operating results or financial condition. We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. The results of, and costs associated with, complex litigation matters are difficult to predict, and the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved lawsuits could harm our business, financial condition, and reputation. Negative developments with respect to pending lawsuits could cause our stock price to decline, and an unfavorable resolution of any particular lawsuit could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we may become involved in regulatory investigations or other governmental or private legal proceedings, which could be distracting, expensive and time consuming for us, and if public, may also cause our stock price to be negatively impacted. We expect that the number and significance of claims and legal proceedings that assert patent infringement claims or other intellectual property rights covering our products, either directly against us or against our customers, will increase as our business expands. Any claims or proceedings against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or pay amounts to third parties pursuant to contractual indemnity provisions. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. In addition, we expect that we may face legal proceedings for matters unrelated to intellectual property. For example, as described in the section entitled “Legal Proceedings,” a purported shareholder class action suit and shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors. Such shareholder activities or lawsuits, and any related publicity, may result in substantial costs and, among other things, divert the attention of management and our employees. An unfavorable outcome in any claim or proceeding against us could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs, and potentially in future periods. Further, any settlement announced by us may expose us to further claims against us by third parties seeking monetary or other damages which, even if unsuccessful, would divert management attention from the business and cause us to incur costs, possibly material, to defend such matters.28 If we fail to manage our exposure to the volatility and economic uncertainty in the global financial marketplace successfully, our operating results could be adversely impacted. We are exposed to financial risk associated with the global financial markets, which includes volatility in interest rates, uncertainty in the credit markets and instability in the foreign currency exchange market. Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our term loan debt facility. The valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings or quality of the securities, interest rate changes, the ongoing strength and quality of the global credit market and liquidity. All of the securities in our investment portfolio are investment-grade rated, but the instability of the credit market could impact those ratings and our decision to hold these securities, if they do not meet our minimum credit rating requirements. If we should decide to sell such securities, we may suffer losses in principal value that have significantly declined in value due to the declining credit rating of the securities and the ongoing strength and the global financial markets as a whole. The interest rate on our term loan debt facility is based upon LIBOR and to the extent that LIBOR interest rates increase, our annual interest expense on this term loan debt will increase. With the instability in the financial markets, we could incur significant realized or other than temporary impairment losses associated with certain of our investments which would reduce our net income. We may also incur further temporary impairment charges requiring us to record additional unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income. For more information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates, see the section entitled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”Delays or loss of government contracts or failure to obtain required government certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business. We sell our products indirectly and provide services to governmental entities in accordance with certain regulated contractual arrangements. While reporting and compliance with government contracts is both our responsibility and the responsibility of our partner, a lack of reporting or compliance by us or our partners could have an impact on the sales of our products to government agencies. Further, the United States Federal government has certain certification and product requirements for products sold to them. If we are unable to meet applicable certification or other requirements within the timeframes specified by the United States Federal government, or if our competitors have certifications for competitive products for which we are not yet certified, our revenues and results of operations would be adversely impacted. Changes in our tax rates could adversely affect our future results. We are a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates, which are difficult to predict, could be unfavorably affected by changes in, or interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by lapses of the availability of the U.S. research and development tax credit, which occurred for 2012 but was reinstated on January 2, 2013 as part of the "American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012." The new law provides for an extension of the federal research credit retroactive for 2012 and extended through 2013. Further, the accounting for stock compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718 and uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 could result in more unpredictability and variability to our future effective tax rates. We are also subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and currently are under examination in a few foreign jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We may underestimate the outcome of such examinations which, if significant, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Business interruptions could adversely affect our operations. Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, or other natural disaster, quarantines or other disruptions associated with infectious diseases, national catastrophe, terrorist activities, war, ongoing disturbances in the Middle East, an attack on Israel, disruptions in our computing and communications infrastructure due to power loss, telecommunications failure, human error, physical or electronic security breaches and computer viruses (which could leave us vulnerable to the loss of our intellectual property or the confidential information of our customers, disruption of our business activities and potential litigation), and other events beyond our control. We have a business continuity program that is based on enterprise risk assessment which addresses the impact of natural, technological, man-made and geopolitical disasters on our critical business functions. This plan helps facilitate the continuation of critical business activities in the event of a disaster but may not prove to be sufficient. In addition, our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur, and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, given our linearity, any interruption of our business, business processes or systems late in a fiscal quarter could potentially negatively impact our financial results for such period. 29 In the case of our managed services business, any circuit failure or downtime could affect a significant portion of our customers. Since our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our ability to provide customers with highly reliable service, even minor interruptions could harm our reputation, require that we incur additional expense to acquire alternative telecommunications capacity, or cause us to miss contractual obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our business. Our cash flow could fluctuate due to the potential difficulty of collecting our receivables and managing our inventories. Over the past few years, we have made significant investments in EMEA and Asia to expand our business in these regions. In EMEA and Asia, as with other international regions, credit terms are typically longer than in the United States. Therefore, as Europe, Asia and other international regions grow as a percentage of our revenues, accounts receivable balances increase and our days sales outstanding decrease. Although from time to time we have been able to largely offset the effects of these influences through additional incentives offered to channel partners at the end of each quarter in the form of prepay discounts, these additional incentives have lowered our profitability. In addition, economic uncertainty or a downturn in technology spending in the United States and other countries could restrict the availability of capital, which may delay our collections from our channel partners beyond our historical experience or may cause companies to file for bankruptcy. Either a delay in collections or bankruptcy would harm our cash flow and accounts receivable day’s outstanding performance. In addition, as we manage our business and focus on more cost effective shipment lead times for certain of our products and implement freight cost reduction programs, our inventory levels may increase, resulting in decreased inventory turns that could negatively impact our cash flow. We believe inventory turns will continue to fluctuate depending upon our ability to reduce lead times, as well as due to changes in anticipated product demand and product mix and the mix of ocean freight versus air freight. Our stock price is volatile and fluctuates as a result of the conduct of our business and stock market. The market price of our common stock has from time to time experienced significant fluctuations. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by a variety of factors, including: statements or changes in opinions, ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the market in which we do business, including competitors, partners, suppliers or telecommunications industry leaders or relating to us specifically; changes in our executive team or speculation in the press or the investment community about changes; the announcement of new products, product enhancements or acquisitions by us or by our competitors; technological innovations by us or our competitors; quarterly variations in our results of operations; failure of our future operating results to meet expectations of stock market analysts or investors, which is inherently subject to greater risk and uncertainty as expectations increase, or any financial guidance we may provide to the market; general market conditions or market conditions specific to technology industries; and domestic and international macroeconomic factors. We have experienced volatility in our stock price, which sometimes results in attempts by shareholders to involve themselves in the governance and strategic direction of a company above and apart from normal interactions between shareholders and management. In addition, class action litigation is sometimes instituted following periods of volatility. Such shareholder activities or lawsuits, and any related publicity, may result in substantial costs and, among other things, divert the attention of management and our employees. We are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”), we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Such report contains, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. While we were able to assert in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013, we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our control framework may suffer if we are unable to adapt our control framework appropriately as we continue to grow our business. If we are unable to assert in any future reporting period that our internal control over financial reporting is effective (or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have an adverse effect on our stock price. 30 Changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices may adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in existing accounting rules or practices, new accounting pronouncements, or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or result in changes to our business operations in support of such changes. Further, such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
