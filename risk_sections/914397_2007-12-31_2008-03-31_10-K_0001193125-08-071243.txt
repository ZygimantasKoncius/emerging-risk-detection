Risk Factors, below for additional discussion of these factors. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. Changes may occur after that date, and the Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law in the normal course of its public disclosure practices. 1 Table of Contents PART I Item 1. BUSINESS General Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd. (Great Lakes or the Company) is a regional airline operating as an independent carrier and as a code share partner with United Air Lines, Inc. (United Air Lines or United) and Frontier Airlines, Inc. (Frontier Airlines or Frontier). As of March 15, 2008, the Company served twelve states with 32 destinations to and from Denver, Colorado, four destinations to and from Phoenix, Arizona, five destinations to and from St. Louis, Missouri, five destinations to and from Kansas City, Missouri and two destinations to and from Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Company was incorporated on October 25, 1979, as an Iowa corporation and became a publicly traded company on January 21, 1994. General information about the Company can be found at www.flygreatlakes.com. The Companys annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments and exhibits to those reports, are available free of charge through the Companys website as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company has filed such reports with, or furnished them to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Information on the Companys website is not incorporated into, nor a part of, this Form 10-K or the Companys other securities filings. Essential Air Service Program The Company derived approximately 25% of its total revenue from the Essential Air Service program (EAS) in 2007, which is administered by the United States Department of Transportation (the DOT). The EAS program was instituted under the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (the Deregulation Act), which allowed airlines greater freedom to introduce, increase, and generally reduce or eliminate service to existing markets. Under the EAS program, certain communities are guaranteed specified levels of essential air service. In order to promote the provision of essential air services, the DOT may authorize the payment of federal subsidies to compensate an air carrier that is providing essential air services in otherwise unprofitable or minimally profitable markets. An airline serving a community that qualifies for essential air services is required to give the DOT advance notice before the airline may terminate, suspend, or reduce service. Depending on the circumstances, the DOT may require the continuation of existing service until a replacement carrier is found. EAS rates are normally set for two-year periods for each city. Significant fluctuations in passenger revenues, as well as fluctuations in fuel and other costs, may cause EAS routes to become unprofitable during these two-year terms. At the end of the two year term for EAS service to a particular city, the DOT may request competitive proposals from other airlines. Proposals, when requested, are evaluated on, among other things, the level of service provided, the amount of subsidy requested, the fitness of the applicant, and comments from the communities served. Congress set the EAS funding level at $102 million for the federal fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, and $110 million for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2006 and 2007. Congress is currently proposing $110 million for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008. The Company initiated scheduled air service to Gallup, NM in July 2007 with the assistance of a grant awarded to the New Mexico Department of Transportation provided by the DOT Small Community Air Service Development Program. The Company will discontinue this service on March 30, 2008. Under a similar grant program, the Company discontinued service to Sierra Vista, AZ in the first quarter of 2007. 2 Table of Contents During 2007, the Company began providing EAS service to Burlington, IA; Marion, IL; Quincy, IL; Decatur, IL; Ft. Leonard Wood, MO and Great Bend, KS. The Company also discontinued scheduled services to Brookings, SD; Prescott, AZ and Kingman, AZ. In October 2007, the Companys proposal to provide Essential Air Service to serve Vernal, UT; Moab, UT; Ely, NV; Merced, CA and Visalia, CA was accepted by the DOT. The Companys proposal to provide Essential Air Service to serve seven Montana communities was accepted by the DOT on December 22, 2007. Essential Air Service Program Activity Subsequent to December 31, 2007 On January 7, 2008, the Company commenced scheduled Essential Air Service to Vernal and Moab, UT from Denver, CO. On February 6, 2008 the Company was selected to provide EAS service to Manhattan, KS and Salina, KS from Kansas City, MO, and Cape Girardeau, MO, Jackson, TN and Owensboro, KY from Kansas City, MO, St. Louis, MO or Cincinnati, OH. As of February 29, 2008, the Company served 28 EAS communities on a subsidized basis. United Air Lines and Frontier Airlines Code Share Relationships United Air Lines. The Company has operated under a code share agreement with United Air Lines since 2001. The terms of the United code share agreement were amended effective July 18, 2003 and again on November 1, 2007. The current terms of the United code share agreement provide that the Company place United Air Lines flight designator codes on certain flights of the Company that connect with United flights in Albuquerque, NM; Denver, CO; Kansas City, MO and Phoenix, AZ, and anticipates adding Las Vegas, NV. Frontier Airlines. On May 3, 2001, the Company entered into a code share agreement with Frontier, which was implemented July 9, 2001. The Frontier agreement provides for the use of Frontiers flight designator code on Great Lakes flights connecting with Frontiers flights in Denver. Accordingly, certain flights to and from Denver carry both the United Air Lines and Frontier Airlines flight designator codes as well as the Great Lakes flight designator. Markets As of December 31, 2007, the Company operated 232 weekday flights. Service scheduled to and from its five hubs include; 148 flights at Denver, 8 flights at Albuquerque, 12 flights at Phoenix, 20 flights at St. Louis and 12 flights at Kansas City, MO. The Company frequently modifies its routes. For a current map of routes being flown, please visit our website at www.flygreatlakes.com. 3 Table of Contents As of March 28, 2008, the Companys route map, consisting of current scheduled service and recently awarded Essential Air Service communities, is as follows: Marketing The Companys services are marketed primarily by means of the Companys internet web site, global distributions systems (travel agencies and travel agent web sites), the Companys reservation call center and seat capacity made available through the Companys code share agreements. The Companys promotional programs emphasize the Companys close affiliation with its code share partners and, in particular, the opportunity for the Companys passengers to participate in related customer service benefits, such as frequent flyer programs. Yield Management The Company monitors its inventory and pricing of available seats utilizing yield management techniques. These processes enable the Companys revenue control analysts to examine the Companys past traffic and pricing trends, and to estimate the optimal number of seats to make available for sale at various fares. The analysts then monitors each flight to adjust seat allocations and booking levels, with the objective of maximizing total revenue for each flight. 4 Table of Contents Charter and Freight Service The Company uses its Beechcraft 1900Ds and Embraer Brasilia aircraft to provide charter services to private individuals, corporations and athletic teams. The Company also carries freight and small packages on most of its scheduled flights. Combined revenues from the Companys leases, charter flights and freight air service were 0.9%, 1.5%, and 1.6% of the Companys total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Seasonality The airline industry generally is subject to cyclical moves in the economy. Because both personal discretionary travel and business travel may be expected to decline during periods of economic weakness, the airline industry tends to experience poorer financial results during such periods. Seasonal factors, primarily weather conditions and passenger demand, generally affect our monthly passenger enplanements. We have historically shown a higher level of passenger enplanements in the May through October period as compared with the November through April period for many of the cities served. These seasonal factors have generally resulted in reduced revenues, lower operating income, and less cash flow for the Company during the November through April period. As a result of such factors, our revenues and earnings have shown a corresponding increase during the May through October period. Competition The Company competes for passenger traffic with regional and major air carriers and ground transportation. The Company may also compete with other regional air carriers to receive EAS subsidies for providing air service to small communities. The Companys competition from other air carriers varies from location to location and, in certain areas, comes from regional and major carriers who serve the same or nearby destinations as the Company, but through different hub and spoke systems. The Company could experience increased competition from competitors or on one or more of the Companys routes. Aircraft As of December 31, 2007, the Companys fleet consisted of 25 Beechcraft Model 1900D 19-passenger aircraft and six Embraer Brasilia Model 120 30-passenger aircraft. Beechcraft 1900D Aircraft. The 19 passenger Beechcraft 1900D aircraft are pressurized, weather radar equipped, and offer a 310-mile per hour cruising speed. Embraer Brasilia Aircraft. The 30-passenger Embraer Brasilia aircraft are pressurized, weather radar equipped, has restrooms, is staffed with a flight attendant, and offers a 330-mile per hour cruising speed. 5 Table of Contents A summary of the Companys operating aircraft as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Beechcraft1900D EmbraerBrasilia Beechcraft1900D EmbraerBrasilia Beechcraft1900D EmbraerBrasilia Owned 25 4 25 4 25 4 Operating leases  2  2  2 25 6 25 6 25 6 Leased to another carrier     (2 )  Available for operations 25 6 25 6 23 6 As of December 31, 2007, the average age of the Companys aircraft was approximately 13 years, and as of December 31, 2006, the average age of the Companys aircraft was approximately 12 years as the Company has operated the same fleet of aircraft in both years. Maintenance The Federal Aviation Administration (the FAA) mandates periodic inspection and maintenance of commercial aircraft. The Company performs most of the maintenance and inspection of its aircraft and engines (except engine overhaul) using its own personnel. The heavy maintenance base is located at Cheyenne, Wyoming. Line maintenance is also performed in Denver, Colorado and Phoenix, Arizona. Parts and supplies inventories are maintained at these locations to promote the mechanical dispatch reliability of the fleet. The Company also maintains an inventory of spare engines and propellers for its fleet to allow for minimal downtime during major overhauls. The Company internally performs overhaul of selected aircraft components for its fleet. As required under the Companys Restructuring Agreement with Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation (Raytheon), dated as of December 31, 2002 (the 2002 Restructuring Agreement) (see Liquidity and Financing below), in April 2004, the Company entered into a five-year Fleet Management ProgramTM contract with Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC) under which P&WC supplies the Company with certain engine maintenance services (the FMP contract). In July 2006, the Company amended the FMP contract to extend its term to June 30, 2011 and to reduce the hourly rate the Company pays per flight hour. Monthly amounts to be paid by the Company are based on the total number of Beechcraft 1900D engine flight hours at a fixed contractual rate. The contractual rate per flight hour is subject to annual fixed increases throughout the term of the contract, and the Company is recognizing this expense at a level rate throughout the term of the contract. Since the FMP contract amendment reduced hourly rates retroactively to July 1, 2005, the Company reflected a change in estimate and recorded an adjustment of $582,234 for the renegotiated rate which reduced the corresponding balance payable to P&WC and maintenance expense during the third quarter ending September 30, 2006. Fuel The Company expects to continue to be able to obtain fuel in quantities sufficient to meet its future requirements. The Company contracts, through intermediaries and directly with refiners for the purchase of a significant portion of its aircraft fuel requirements. However, standard industry contracts generally do not provide protection against fuel price increases and do not ensure availability of supply. Accordingly, an increase in the cost of fuel, if not accompanied by an equivalent increase in passenger revenues or subsidies, 6 Table of Contents could have a material adverse impact on the Companys future operating results. During 2007, the Companys average price of fuel, including taxes and plane service fees, was $2.76 per gallon, as compared to $2.42 in 2006 and $2.13 in 2005. At current rates of consumption, a one cent increase or decrease in the per gallon price of fuel will increase or decrease the Companys fuel expense by approximately $93,000 annually. Liquidity and Financing In the first quarter of 2007 and the third and fourth quarters of 2006, the Company successfully renegotiated with its primary creditors to either extinguish debt or renegotiate the terms of their lease, debt, and significant contractual obligations. Pratt and Whitney Canada In July 2006, the Company amended its Fleet Management ProgramTM contract (the FMP contract) with Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC) to extend its term to June 30, 2011 and to reduce the hourly rate the Company pays per flight hour. CIT Aerospace On September 28, 2006, the Company extinguished its debt obligation with CIT Aerospace (CIT) by making cash payment of $2.1 million. During the first nine months of 2006, the Company made total payments of principal and interest on the CIT debt obligation in the amount of $2.7 million. As a result of the extinguishment of debt with CIT, the Company has realized a one-time gain of $1.1 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2006. FINOVA Capital Corporation The Company entered into a settlement agreement with FINOVA Capital Corporation (FINOVA) on October 20, 2006 after returning two Embraer Brasilia aircraft. The terms of the agreement allowed for a reduction in the balance of the outstanding lease obligations and accrued penalty interest from $1.4 million to $0.85 million, for which the Company entered into a promissory note payable in 45 equal monthly installments of $22,342, including interest, with the first payment being made October 31, 2006. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 15, the Company recorded the FINOVA debt in the amount of $1.0 million. The Company prepaid the debt in the third quarter of 2007 at a discounted rate. As a result the Company recorded a gain of approximately $412,000. Boeing Corporation On December 20, 2006, the Company and Boeing Capital Corporation (Boeing) entered into a Settlement Agreement and Lease Amendment that discharged the Companys obligations for defaulted rent and other payments due to Boeing under lease agreements for two Embraer aircraft. The total discharged payment defaults were $10,067,097. Simultaneously, the Company paid Boeing a lump sum of $1,150,000 and a maintenance rent payment for two aircraft engines. The lease was amended to: (i) reduce the monthly rental payments for each aircraft; (ii) require the Company to pay maintenance rent, which will be reimbursable upon completion of certain maintenance events; and (iii) remove the Companys option to purchase the aircraft at the end of the April 2013 lease term at the aircrafts then fair market value. The total discharged deferred lease payments were $8.3 million and total discharge including accrued interest and penalties resulted in a gain for 2006 of $10.1 million. The Settlement Agreement and Lease Amendment cured all existing defaults with Boeing. 7 Table of Contents Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation On March 9, 2007, the Company and Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation (Raytheon) entered into an Amended and Restated Restructuring Agreement (the Amended Agreement), which amends and restates in its entirety the Restructuring Agreement between the Company and Raytheon dated as of December 31, 2002, (the 2002 Restructuring Agreement). Pursuant to the Amended Agreement, the Company issued to Raytheon 25 amended and restated promissory notes (the Aircraft Notes), each secured by an amended security agreement in the related aircraft. The Aircraft Notes replace the existing notes issued by the Company to Raytheon on December 31, 2002. Each of the Aircraft Notes has an original principal amount of $2,116,573.70, for a total amount of $52,914,343, bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% per annum, and provides for monthly payments in arrears starting on March 30, 2007. The Aircraft Notes mature on June 30, 2011, at which time a final payment of $1,306,674.84 will be due for each aircraft. The fixed rate of 6.75% on the Aircraft Notes represents a significant reduction in interest expense and eliminates variable interest rate risk on all of the Companys aircraft debt. Under the Amended Agreement, the Company issued to Raytheon a promissory note (the Senior Note) that replaces the existing senior note and subordinated note issued by the Company to Raytheon on December 31, 2002. The Senior Note has an original principal amount of $13,174,754.62 and bears interest at a rate of 7.00%. Interest on the Senior Note is payable monthly in arrears on the last day of each month, commencing on March 30, 2007. Beginning with the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2007, the Senior Note will provide for quarterly payments of principal on June 30, September 30, and December 30 each year until the note matures on December 30, 2015. As additional security for the Senior Note, the Company pledged four Embraer Brasalia aircraft; as well as, all other assets of the Company. For additional information regarding the Companys arrangements with Raytheon, see Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation  Liquidity and Capital Resources. As further consideration for the concessions granted by Raytheon in the 2002 Restructuring Agreement, the Company issued 5,371,980 shares of the Companys common stock to Raytheon, representing an approximate 38.2% interest in the Companys then outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, the Company granted Raytheon observer rights for meetings of the Companys Board of Directors, but without any right to vote or enter into any discussions at any Board of Directors meetings. As part of the Amended Agreement, Raytheon has relinquished its observer rights. The Amended Agreement requires the Company to file a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to permit Raytheon to resell its shares of Company Common Stock, which the Company has agreed to file by April 30, 2008. The debt payments to be made under the Amended Agreement are closely aligned with the Companys forecasted cash flows. Under the Amended Agreement, the Company is no longer required to comply with any financial covenant ratios. The Amended Agreement provides for limitations on capital expenditures, incremental indebtedness, anti-dilution of the Companys common stock, restrictions on equity issuances, encumbrances of assets, and mergers and acquisitions without Raytheons prior consent. Other Leases The Company leases office and hangar space, and office equipment for its headquarters, reservation facilities, airport facilities, and certain other equipment. The Company also leases certain airport gate and terminal facilities on a month-to-month basis. Release of Tax Valuation Allowance Until the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company had recorded a valuation allowance to fully reserve its net deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to utilize most of its net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration and other 8 Table of Contents deferred tax assets as they reverse. As a result, the Company released most of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance and recorded a $10.5 million income tax benefit on the Companys income statement which represents the difference between the $10.7 million deferred tax benefit and $0.2 million of alternative minimum tax expense. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has approximately $66.5 million of Federal net operating loss carryforwards, which will be available to offset future taxable income. A valuation allowance of $500,000 remains at December 31, 2007 for state net operating loss carryforwards that may not be recovered. Transportation Security Administration At June 30, 2004, the Company was obligated to the Transportation Security Administration for $2.5 million, representing collections from passengers for security fees and amounts due from the Company for aviation security infrastructure fees. On August 11, 2004, the Company restructured this obligation into an installment note. This obligation was retired on June 20, 2007. Employees At March 1, 2008, the Company had 581 full-time and 348 part-time active employees, as compared to 557 full-time and 288 part-time active employees at March 1, 2007. The Companys pilots are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). The Companys labor agreement with the pilots became amendable on October 30, 2000. In May 2006, the Company and the IBT agreed to binding arbitration to achieve a new three year labor agreement. On September 16, 2006, the arbitrator ruled on terms that resulted in a new labor agreement that will not become amendable until September 16, 2009. The Companys flight attendants are also represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the Companys agreement with the flight attendants became amendable on April 1, 2002. Negotiations with the flight attendants are inactive at the present time. The Companys mechanics and maintenance clerks are represented by the International Association of Machinists (IAM). The Companys agreement with the mechanics became amendable on November 1, 2005, and the Companys agreement with the maintenance clerks became amendable on March 1, 2002. On October 19, 2007, the IAM, the designated collective bargaining representative of the class and craft of Mechanics and Related and Clerical employees, sued the Company in Colorado federal court. The following Monday, October 22, 2007, the Company sued the IAM in Minnesota. For additional detail with respect to the status of these matters, see Item 3 of this report, Legal Proceedings below. In 2003, the Companys dispatchers voted to be represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Negotiations with the dispatchers are inactive at the present time. 9 Table of Contents Executive Officers of the Registrant The following table provides information with respect to the Companys executive officers as of March 15, 2008.

Regulation In accordance with the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the 1958 Act), the Company is an air carrier subject to regulation by the DOT, primarily with respect to economic matters. As a commuter air carrier, the Company is licensed under Part 298 of the Economic Regulations of the DOT. The Company holds an air carrier operating certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) pursuant to Part 121 of the FAAs regulations. To ensure compliance with its regulations, the FAA requires that an airline obtain an operating certificate and operations specifications for each particular aircraft and type of operations conducted by the carrier, all of which are subject to suspension or revocation for cause. As a result, the Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the FAA with respect to the Companys operations, aircraft maintenance, and safety related matters, including, but not limited to, equipment, ground facilities, dispatch, communications, training, weather observation, flight personnel, and other matters affecting air safety. The Deregulation Act of 1978 eliminated many regulatory constraints so that airlines became free to set fares and, with limited exceptions, to establish domestic routes without the necessity of seeking government approval. The DOT is still authorized to establish consumer protection regulations in order to prohibit certain pricing 10 Table of Contents practices, mandate conditions of carriage, and make ongoing determinations of a carriers fitness, willingness, and ability to provide air transportation properly and lawfully. The DOT also has the power to bring proceedings to enforce its regulations under the 1958 Act and seek penalties, including the assessment of civil penalties, the revocation of operating authority, and criminal sanctions. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act requires the adoption of certain security measures by airlines and airports, including the screening of passengers and baggage. The security measures are being partially funded by a per flight segment tax on tickets. The Company is responsible for certain security costs above this level. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission regarding the use of the Companys radio facilities. In addition, local governments and authorities in certain markets have adopted regulations governing various aspects of aircraft operations, including noise abatement, curfews, and use of airport facilities. The Company believes that it is in compliance with all such regulations. Insurance The Company carries the types and amounts of insurance that are required by the DOT and are customary in the regional airline industry, including coverage for public liability, property damage, aircraft loss or damage, baggage and cargo liability, and workers compensation. As a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, aviation insurers have significantly increased premiums for all aviation coverage, while dramatically reducing the amount of coverage available for war-risk occurrences. In response to the reduction in coverage, the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Stabilization Act) provided U.S. air carriers with the option to purchase certain war-risk liability insurance from the United States government on an interim basis at rates that are more favorable than those available in the private market. The Company has purchased this coverage and anticipates renewing it for as long as the coverage is available from the United States government. The airline and insurance industries, together with the United States and other governments, are continuing to evaluate both the cost of aviation insurance and options for providing insurance coverage. The Company anticipates that it will follow industry practices with respect to sources of insurance. The Company believes that its insurance is adequate as to amounts and risks covered. There can be no assurance, however, that the limits of the Companys insurance will be sufficient to cover any catastrophic loss. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Financial Condition of the Company During the year ended December 31, 2006 and in March 2007 the Company had successfully renegotiated with its lenders to extinguish debt or renegotiate the terms of their lease and debt agreements. Failure by the Company to comply with the terms and conditions of its debt and lease obligations could affect the Companys ability to secure additional financing to facilitate growth. These transactions are discussed further in notes (2), (5) and (7) of the accompanying financial statement. 11 Table of Contents Dependence on Relationship with United Air Lines Currently, the Company estimates that approximately 40% of Great Lakes connecting passenger traffic with United Air Lines flights utilizes the United code share product line. As a result of the Companys relationship with United Air Lines (United), the Companys business is sensitive to events and risks affecting United. If adverse events affect Uniteds business, the Companys business could also be adversely affected. Such events include the ability of United to achieve financial viability after exiting Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, changes in Uniteds business plan or model, employee strikes or job actions, significant curtailment of services, and terrorist events. However, to the extent that the Company is successful in developing both its own identity in its route system and its code share relationship with Frontier Airlines and interline partnerships with other airlines, the Company will reduce its dependence on United and mitigate the effects of any adverse events that are related solely to United. Terrorist Events The Companys operations are sensitive to changes in the economy and airline industry that are caused by, or related to, past and future terrorist attacks. Such changes include, but are not limited to, the impact of additional airline and security charges on Company costs, reduced customer demand for travel, the cost and availability of war-risk and other aviation insurance (including the federal governments provision of third party war-risk coverage). War War or other military action by the United States or other countries could have a significant effect on passenger traffic. Dependence on Essential Air Service Revenues In 2007, the Company received approximately $24.1 million of EAS subsidies as compensation for Essential Air Service provided by the Company to small cities, as compared to $23.9 million in 2006. EAS subsidies are expected to remain a significant portion of the Companys revenues in future years. The total amount of EAS subsidy ultimately received by the Company over an extended period is determined by, among other things, overall funding levels to the DOT by Congress, competitive bids by other carriers, schedule modifications at the request of the DOT, and the Companys optimization of its schedules. The DOT awards EAS subsidies through competitive bidding and the Company could lose its EAS subsidy to competitors. In addition, the DOT has the right to cancel EAS arrangements if it determines that the communities served by such arrangements are no longer eligible. Effect of General Economic Conditions The airline industry is significantly affected by general economic conditions. During recent recessions, most airlines reduced fares in an effort to increase traffic. Economic and competitive conditions in the airline industry have contributed to a number of airline bankruptcies. A worsening of current economic conditions, or an extended period of recession, whether nationally or regionally would have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations. See Forward-Looking Statements at the front of this report. 12 Table of Contents Fuel Costs Aircraft fuel is a major component of the Companys operating expenses. Aircraft fuel represented approximately 28.4% of the Companys operating expenses in 2007 compared to 24.8% of the Companys operating expenses in 2006. The Company does participate in risk-based fuel hedging instruments. The Companys cost of fuel varies directly with market conditions, and the Company has no guaranteed long-term sources of supply. Generally, the Company intends to follow industry trends by raising fares in response to significant fuel price increases. However, the Companys ability to pass on increased fuel costs through fare or EAS subsidy increases may be limited by economic and competitive conditions. Accordingly, a reduction in the availability of, or an increase in the price of fuel, could have a material adverse effect on both the Companys cash flow from operations and the Companys profitability. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, the Companys average price per gallon of fuel consumed increased to an average of $2.76 per gallon compared to the average price per gallon of $2.42 for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. The Company estimates that every $.01 increase in the price per gallon of fuel equates to an annualized increase in fuel expense of approximately $93,000 based on 2007 operating activity. Control by Principal Stockholders Raytheon, the Companys principal creditor, owns 5,371,980 shares of the Companys common stock, representing an approximate 38.2% interest in the Companys outstanding shares of common stock.

Limited Market for Company Securities The Companys Common Stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Small Cap Market on August 14, 2002. As a result of the delisting, the Companys Common Stock has become subject to certain rules of the SEC relating to penny stocks. These rules require broker-dealers to make a suitability determination for purchasers and to receive the purchasers prior written consent for a purchase transaction, thus restricting the ability to purchase or sell the securities in the open market. Trading of the Companys Common Stock is conducted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which was established for securities that do not meet NASDAQ listing requirements. Consequently, trading the Companys Common Stock may be more difficult because of lower trading volumes, transaction delays, and reduced security analyst and news media coverage of the Company. These factors could also contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for the Companys Common Stock. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None 13 Table of Contents
