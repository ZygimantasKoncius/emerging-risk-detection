ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements We have made and will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders (our 2008 Annual Report) and in other contexts relating to future growth and profitability targets and strategies designed to increase total shareholder value. Forward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, information regarding our future economic and financial condition, the plans and objectives of our management and our assumptions regarding our performance and these plans and objectives. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. We desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of that Act. Some forward-looking statements that we make in our 2008 Annual Report, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other contexts represent challenging goals for our Company, the achievement of which is subject to a variety of risks and assumptions and numerous factors beyond our control. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make are described below. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the following cautionary statements. Updates to our risk factors as a result of our 2008 product recalls and the related governmental investigation are included below. 13 Table of Contents FIFRA Compliance, the Corresponding Governmental Investigation and Related Matters Our products that contain pesticides must comply with FIFRA and be registered with the U.S. EPA (and similar state agencies) before they can be sold or distributed. In April 2008, we became aware that a former associate apparently deliberately circumvented Company policies and U.S. EPA regulations under FIFRA by failing to obtain valid registrations for products and/or causing invalid product registration forms to be submitted to regulators. Since that time, we have been cooperating with the U.S. EPA in its civil investigation into pesticide product registration issues involving the Company and with the U.S. EPA and the U.S. DOJ in a related criminal investigation. In connection with the registration investigation and FIFRA compliance review process, we have recorded, and in the future may record, charges and costs, based on our most recent estimates, of retailer inventory returns, consumer returns and replacement costs, costs to rework existing products, inventory write-downs, associated legal and professional fees and costs associated with administration of the registration investigation and compliance review process. Because these current and expected future charges are based on estimates, they may increase as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the amount of products that may be returned by consumers and retailers, the number and type of legal or regulatory proceedings relating to the registration investigation and FIFRA compliance review process and regulatory or judicial orders or decrees that may require us to take certain actions in connection with the registration investigation and FIFRA compliance review process or to pay civil or criminal fines and/or penalties at the state and/or federal level. There can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of the investigation will not result in further action against us, whether administrative, civil or criminal, by the U.S. EPA, U.S. DOJ, state regulatory agencies or private litigants, and any such action, in addition to the costs we have incurred and would continue to incur in connection therewith, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In particular, a significant fine, penalty or judgment assessed against us could result in a charge to earnings or an increase in debt which materially affects our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities, potentially causing us to have to seek an amendment or waiver from our lending group. While we believe we have good relationships with our banking group, given the adverse conditions currently present in the global credit markets, we can provide no assurance that such a request would be likely to result in a modified or replacement credit facility on reasonable terms, if at all. Product recalls, our inability to ship, sell or transport affected products and the on-going governmental investigation may harm our reputation and acceptance of our products by our retail customers and consumers, which may materially and adversely affect our business operations, decrease sales and increase costs. Moreover, the FIFRA compliance issues we have disclosed throughout fiscal 2008, together with the corresponding governmental investigation by the U.S. EPA and U.S. DOJ, have resulted in coverage critical of us in the press and media. While we believe that these compliance issues are primarily the result of the misguided actions of a former associate who misled us, some of the issues identified appear unrelated to the former associate. And although we believe we have acted promptly, responsibly and in the public interest, these compliance issues may nevertheless harm our reputation and the acceptance of our products by consumers and our retailer customers. Our retailer customers may be less willing to purchase our products or to provide marketing support for those products, such as shelf space, promotions and advertising, or may impose additional requirements that could materially and adversely affect our business operations, decrease sales and increase costs. On September 26, 2008, the Company, doing business as Scotts LawnService®, was named as a defendant in a purported class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan relating to certain pesticide products. In the suit, Mark Baumkel, on behalf of himself and the purported classes, seeks an unspecified amount of damages, plus costs and attorney fees, for alleged claims involving breach of contract, unjust enrichment and violation of the Michigan consumer protection act. Given the preliminary stages of the proceedings, no reserves have been booked at this time, and the Company intends to vigorously contest the plaintiffs assertions. Commodity Cost Pressures Our ability to manage our cost structure can be adversely affected by movements in commodity and other raw material prices, such as those experienced in both fiscal 2008 and 2007. Market conditions may limit the Companys ability to raise selling prices to offset increases in our input and distribution 14 Table of Contents costs. The uniqueness of our technologies can limit our ability to locate or utilize alternative inputs for certain products. For certain inputs, new sources of supply may have to be qualified under regulatory standards, which can require additional investment and delay bringing a product to market. Competition Each of our segments participates in markets that are highly competitive. Many of our competitors sell their products at prices lower than ours. The most price sensitive segment of our category may be more likely to trade down to lower price point products in a more challenging economic environment. We compete primarily on the basis of product innovation, product quality, product performance, value, brand strength, supply chain competency, field sales support and advertising. Some of our competitors have significant financial resources. The strong competition that we face in all of our markets may prevent us from achieving our revenue goals, which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Regulatory Environment Local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters affect us in several ways. In the United States, all products containing pesticides must comply with FIFRA and be registered with the U.S. EPA (and similar state agencies) before they can be sold or distributed. The inability to obtain or maintain such compliance, or the cancellation of any registration, could have an adverse effect on our business, the severity of which would depend on the products involved, whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected. We attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of, and access to, substitute active ingredients, but there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to avoid or minimize these risks. In the EU, the European Parliament is considering the adoption of certain regulations, the effect of which would substantially restrict or eliminate our ability to market and sell certain of our pesticide products. If these regulations were to be adopted in their current form in the EU, the resulting impact on our consumer and professional European controls businesses could be materially adversely impacted. In addition, there are provincially-driven regulations pending across Canada that, depending on the timing and scope of final issuance, could substantially restrict or eliminate our ability to market and sell certain of our consumer pesticide products there. Under the Food Quality Protection Act, enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1996, food-use pesticides are evaluated to determine whether there is reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the cumulative effects of pesticide exposures. Under this Act, the U.S. EPA is evaluating the cumulative risks from dietary and non-dietary exposures to pesticides. The pesticides in our products, certain of which may be used on crops processed into various food products, are typically manufactured by independent third parties and continue to be evaluated by the U.S. EPA as part of this exposure risk assessment. The U.S. EPA or the third party registrant may decide that a pesticide we use in our products will be limited or made unavailable to us. For example, in December 2000, the U.S. EPA reached agreement with various parties, including manufacturers of the active ingredient diazinon, regarding a phased withdrawal from retailers by December 2004 of residential uses of products containing diazinon, which was also used in our lawn and garden products. We cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of continuing evaluations. In addition, the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local, state, federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations, may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients. Even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations, we cannot provide assurance that our products, particularly pesticide products, will not cause injury to the environment or to people under all circumstances. The costs of compliance, remediation or products liability have adversely affected operating results in the past and could materially adversely affect future quarterly or annual operating results. Perceptions that the products we produce and market are not safe could adversely affect us and contribute to the risk we will be subjected to legal action. We manufacture and market a number of complex chemical products, such as fertilizers, certain growing media, herbicides and pesticides. On 15 Table of Contents occasion, allegations are made that some of our products have failed to perform up to expectations or have caused damage or injury to individuals or property. Based on reports of contamination at a third party suppliers vermiculite mine, the public may perceive that some of our products manufactured in the past using vermiculite are or may be contaminated. Public perception that our products are not safe, whether justified or not, could impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brand names and have a material adverse affect on our business. The harvesting of peat for our growing media business has come under increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny. In the United States, state regulations frequently require us to limit our harvesting and to restore the property to an agreed-upon condition. In some locations, we have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water. In the United Kingdom, our peat extraction efforts are also the subject of legislation. In addition to the regulations already described, local, state, federal and foreign agencies regulate the disposal, handling and storage of waste, air and water discharges from our facilities. The adequacy of our current non-FIFRA compliance related environmental reserves and future provisions is based on our operating in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations and several significant assumptions:  that we have identified all of the significant sites that must be remediated;  that there are no significant conditions of potential contamination that are unknown to us; and  that with respect to the agreed judicial consent order in Ohio relating to the remediation of the Marysville site, the potentially contaminated soil can be remediated in place rather than having to be removed and only specific stream segments will require remediation as opposed to the entire stream. If there is a significant change in the facts and circumstances surrounding these assumptions or if we are found not to be in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations, it could have a material adverse impact on future environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Manufacturing We use a combination of internal and outsourced facilities to manufacture our products. We are subject to the inherent risks in such activities, including product quality, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, environmental events, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, disruptions in logistics, labor disputes and industrial accidents. Furthermore, we are subject to natural disasters and other factors over which the Company has no control. Customer Concentration Global Consumer net sales represented approximately 75% of our worldwide net sales in fiscal 2008. Our top three North American retail customers together accounted for 64% of our Global Consumer segment fiscal 2008 net sales and 34% of our outstanding accounts receivable as of September 30, 2008. Home Depot, Lowes and Walmart represented approximately 28%, 18% and 18%, respectively, of our fiscal 2008 Global Consumer net sales. The loss of, or reduction in orders from, Home Depot, Lowes, Walmart or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial results, as could customer disputes regarding shipments, fees, merchandise condition or related matters. Our inability to collect accounts receivable from any of these customers could also have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. We do not have long-term sales agreements with, or other contractual assurances as to future sales to, any of our major retail customers. In addition, continued consolidation in the retail industry has resulted in an increasingly concentrated retail base. To the extent such concentration continues to occur, our net sales and income from operations may be increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of, or other adverse developments involving our relationship with, one or more of our customers. Weather and Seasonality Weather conditions in North America and Europe can have a significant impact on the timing of sales in the spring selling season and overall annual sales. An abnormally wet and/or cold spring 16 Table of Contents throughout North America or Europe could adversely affect both fertilizer and pesticide sales and, therefore, our financial results. Because our products are used primarily in the spring and summer, our business is highly seasonal. For the past three fiscal years, 70% to 75% of our annual net sales have occurred in the second and third fiscal quarters combined. Our working capital needs and borrowings typically peak during the initial weeks of our third fiscal quarter because we are incurring expenditures in preparation for the spring selling season, while the majority of our revenue collections occur later in our third fiscal quarter. If cash on hand is insufficient to pay our obligations as they come due, including interest payments or operating expenses, at a time when we are unable to draw on our credit facilities, this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. Adverse weather conditions could heighten this risk. Debt We have a significant amount of debt that could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under outstanding indebtedness;  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operating activities to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the cash flows available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, advertising, research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;  limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and  expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates. Our ability to make payments and to refinance our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions and to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before maturity. We cannot be sure that we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants and cross default provisions that require us to maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to satisfy those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot be assured we will satisfy those ratios. A breach of any of these financial ratio covenants or other covenants could result in a default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare the applicable outstanding indebtedness due immediately and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. We cannot be sure that our lenders would waive a default or that we could pay the indebtedness in full if it were accelerated. Foreign Operations and Currency Exposures We currently operate manufacturing, sales and service facilities outside of the United States, particularly in Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. In fiscal 2008, international net sales, including Canada, accounted for approximately 24% of our total net sales. Accordingly, we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:  fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 17 Table of Contents  limitations on the remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;  additional costs of compliance with local regulations; and  historically, in certain countries, higher rates of inflation than in the United States. In addition, our operations outside the United States are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. The costs related to our international and Canadian operations could adversely affect our operations and financial results in the future. Acquisitions We make strategic acquisitions from time to time, including the June 2006 acquisition of certain assets of Landmark Seed Company, the May 2006 acquisition of certain assets of Turf-Seed, Inc., the November 2005 acquisition of Gutwein (Morning Song®), the October 2005 acquisition of Rod McLellan Company and the October 2004 acquisition of Smith & Hawken®. Acquisitions have inherent risks, such as obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, retaining key personnel, integration of the acquired business and achievement of planned synergies and projections. We have approximately $745 million of goodwill and intangible assets as of September 30, 2008. Uncertainty regarding the future performance of the acquired businesses could also result in future impairment charges related to the associated goodwill and intangible assets, such as the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008. Significant Agreement If we were to commit a serious default under the Marketing Agreement with Monsanto for consumer Roundup® products, Monsanto may have the right to terminate the Marketing Agreement. If Monsanto were to terminate the Marketing Agreement for cause, we would not be entitled to any termination fee, and we would lose all, or a substantial portion, of the significant source of earnings and overhead expense absorption the Marketing Agreement provides. Monsanto may also be able to terminate the Marketing Agreement within a given region, including North America, without paying us a termination fee if unit volume sales to consumers in that region decline: (1) over a cumulative three-fiscal-year period; or (2) by more than 5% for each of two consecutive years. Equity Ownership Concentration Hagedorn Partnership, L.P. beneficially owned approximately 31% of our outstanding common shares as of November 21, 2008, and has sufficient voting power to significantly influence the election of directors and the approval of other actions requiring the approval of our shareholders.
