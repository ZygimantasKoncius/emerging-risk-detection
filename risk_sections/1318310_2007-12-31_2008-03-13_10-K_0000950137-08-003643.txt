RISK FACTORS The following are significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry We have a history of net losses and no assurance can be provided that we will achieve profitability. We are not profitable and had a net loss of approximately $165.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. Although we expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future, no assurance can be provided that we will achieve profitability in the foreseeable future, or ever. Our short commercialization experience, our recent acquisition of FoxHollow and the integration activities in connection with such acquisition make it difficult to predict our future performance and our failure to accurately predict future performance may lead to volatility in the price of our common stock. Our ability to achieve cash flow positive operations will be influenced by many factors, including the extent and duration of our future operating losses, the level and timing of future sales and expenditures, our ability to integrate FoxHollows operations with ours and to do so in a timely basis and in so doing, to increase net sales and decrease costs, market acceptance of our products, the results and scope of ongoing research and development projects, competing technologies, 31 Table of Contents market and regulatory developments, the future course of intellectual property and other litigation and the other risks described in this section. If we do not achieve profitability within expected time frames, our business and stock price will be negatively impacted. We have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties in integrating FoxHollows operations into ours and may not be unable to realize the anticipated cost savings, net sales and other potential benefits of our acquisition of FoxHollow in a timely manner or at all. As a result, our business, operating results and stock price may be adversely affected. Our acquisition of FoxHollow, which we completed in October 2007, was a significant transaction for us. The success of this acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings, net sales and other potential benefits of the acquisition. Our success in realizing these anticipated potential benefits, however, depends in part upon our ability to integrate successfully the two businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of two independent companies is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. Although we have completed the combination of our and FoxHollows U.S. peripheral vascular sales forces and integrated other sales-related and other functions, these integration activities have not progressed as smoothly as anticipated and to some extent have adversely affected our business, ongoing operations and operating results. Our U.S. peripheral vascular business in particular was negatively impacted by greater than anticipated sales force integration challenges related to our FoxHollow acquisition and higher than expected customer inventory levels of SilverHawk products. Although we believe that certain actions we have taken, including eliminating a layer of sales management and optimizing the size of our U.S. peripheral vascular sales organization, will enable us to overcome the integration challenges and support our future growth objectives, no assurance can be provided that such actions will do so and we still expect such challenges and factors to continue to adversely affect our net sales into the second half of 2008. The difficulties of combining FoxHollows operations with ours include, among other factors:  executing on the strategic vision we communicated to our customers regarding the acquisition;  coordinating and consolidating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;  coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively communicate our capabilities and effectively cross-sell our products;  expanding the sale of FoxHollows products into our international operations and distribution network;  combining our and FoxHollows sales force territories and competencies associated with the sale of our products;  maintaining key employees and employee morale;  addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;  coordinating research and development activities to accelerate introduction of new products and technologies with reduced costs;  preserving our customer, distribution, reseller, manufacturing, supplier, marketing and other important relationships and resolving any potential conflicts;  integrating numerous operating systems, including those involving management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll, employee benefits and regulatory compliance;  reconciling inconsistent standards, controls, procedures and policies; and  creating a consolidated internal control over financial reporting structure to enable us and our independent public registered accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 32 Table of Contents Although we currently estimate one-time transaction and integration-related cash payments relating to the FoxHollow acquisition to be between approximately $71 million to $73 million, this estimate may prove to be inaccurate. In addition, the integration of FoxHollows operations into ours has already resulted in and may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, loss of key employees, diversion of our management and the disruption or interruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing business. For example, John B. Simpson, M.D., Ph.D., the founder and former chief executive officer of FoxHollow resigned in February 2008 as a director and employee of our company. It is possible that either internal or external disruption caused by Dr. Simpsons resignation could adversely affect our business and future net sales. Our inability to successfully complete the integration of FoxHollows operations into ours, to do so within a longer time frame than expected or any failure to achieve the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits of the acquisition could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price. Elevated inventory levels of our SilverHawk product at some of our customers adversely affected our operating results for the fourth quarter 2007 and are expected to continue to adversely affect our operating results into the second half of 2008. We believe that higher than expected customer inventory levels of our SilverHawk product at some of our customers adversely affected our fourth quarter 2007 net sales. While we believe that customer inventory levels in certain customer accounts are beginning to return to more normal levels, we still expect that such elevated inventory levels, as well as continued sales force integration challenges, could adversely affect our net sales into the second half of 2008. No assurance can be provided, however, that such elevated inventory levels will not adversely affect our net sales beyond 2008. In addition, while we have put additional systems in place to better manage field inventory, such as our radio frequency inventory tracking system, commonly known as RFID, that will enable us to more accurately and efficiently track field inventory levels, no assurance can be provided that such systems will improve our field inventory levels or result in better asset management. As a result of the resignation of John B. Simpson, M.D. Ph.D. as a director of our company, Merck & Co., Inc. has the right to terminate the collaboration and license agreement with us. Any loss of revenue from our relationship with Merck as a result of Mercks termination of the agreement or otherwise could have a significant adverse affect on our operating results and our stock price. Whether Merck & Co., Inc. will continue to provide revenue to us in the future will depend upon whether Merck exercises its right to terminate the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement dated September 26, 2006 and the level of support and the commitment made by us to fulfill the terms of the agreement. As a result of Dr. Simpsons resignation from our board of directors in February 2008, Merck has the right to terminate the collaboration and license agreement. Merck may exercise this right at any time within six months of Dr. Simpsons resignation. Although we have been given no indication from Merck, who has a representative on our board of directors, that Merck plans to exercise its termination right under the agreement, no assurance can be provided that Merck will not exercise its right and terminate the agreement. In addition, in the event that we do not honor our terms of the agreement and provide funds, employees and other resources to support the clinical programs necessary to support the work conducted under the agreement, Merck may claim that the agreement has been breached and attempt to terminate it. Any loss of Merck revenue could have a significant adverse affect on our operating results and the price of our common stock might decline as a result of either the adverse impact on our net sales or the loss of investor confidence due to any termination by Merck of the agreement. In order to be successful, we must retain and motivate key employees. Any failure to do so could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to retain and motivate our key employees, including James M. Corbett, our chairman, president and chief executive officer, and key managerial, research and development, and sales and marketing personnel. Mr. Corbetts continuation with us is integral to our future success, based on his significant expertise and knowledge of our business and products. Although we 33 Table of Contents have key person insurance with respect to Mr. Corbett, any loss or interruption of the services of Mr. Corbett could reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations and implement our strategy. Key employees may depart because of difficulties with change and integration or a desire not to remain with our company. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense. Any loss or interruption of the services of our key personnel or any employee slowdowns, strikes or similar actions could significantly reduce our ability to meet our strategic objectives because it may not be possible for us to find appropriate replacement personnel should the need arise. We also must continue to keep our employees focused on our strategies and goals, which may be difficult due to integration efforts. We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms. In addition, any equity financings may be dilutive to our stockholders. We believe that our proposed operating plan can be accomplished without additional financing based on current and projected net sales and expenses, working capital and current and anticipated financing arrangements. However, there can be no assurance that our anticipated net sales or expense projections will be realized. Furthermore, there may be delays in obtaining necessary governmental approvals of products or introducing products to market or other events that may cause our actual cash requirements to exceed those for which we have budgeted. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the amount and timing of our continued losses and our ability to reach profitability, FoxHollow integration costs, expenditures on intellectual property and technologies, the number of clinical trials which we will conduct, new product development and acquisitions. To the extent that our then existing capital, including amounts available under our revolving line of credit, is insufficient to cover any losses and meet these requirements, we will need to raise additional funds through financings or borrowings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets. From time to time, we may also sell certain technology or intellectual property having a development timeline or development cost that is inconsistent with our investment horizon or which does not adequately complement our existing product portfolio. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. Equity financings could result in dilution to our stockholders, and the securities issued in future financings as well as in any future acquisitions may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock. If our need for capital arises because of continued losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital. Our business strategy relies on assumptions about the market for our products, which, if incorrect, would adversely affect our business prospects and profitability. We are focused on the market for endovascular devices used to treat vascular diseases and disorders. We believe that the aging of the general population and increasingly inactive lifestyles will continue and that these trends will increase the need for our products. However, the projected demand for our products could materially differ from actual demand if our assumptions regarding these trends and acceptance of our products by the medical community prove to be incorrect or do not materialize or if drug therapies gain more widespread acceptance as a viable alternative treatment, which in each case, would adversely affect our business and operating results. Some of our products are emerging technologies or have only recently been introduced into the market. If physicians do not recommend and endorse them or if our working relationships with physicians deteriorate, our products may not be accepted in the marketplace, which would adversely affect our business and operating results. In order for us to sell our products, physicians must recommend and endorse them. We may not obtain the necessary recommendations or endorsements from physicians. Acceptance of our products depends on educating the medical community as to the distinctive characteristics, perceived benefits, safety, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of our products compared to products of our competitors, and on training physicians in the proper application of our products. We often need to invest in significant training and education of our physician customers to achieve market acceptance of our products with no assurance of success. For example, the future success of our SilverHawk products is dependent upon us educating 34 Table of Contents physicians, and in particular interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, as well as general practitioners and other physicians, about screening for peripheral artery disease, or PAD, or about referral opportunities. If we are not successful in obtaining the recommendations or endorsements of physicians for our products, if customers prefer our competitors products or if our products otherwise do not gain market acceptance, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians, many of our products may not be developed and marketed consistent with the needs and expectations of professionals who use and support our products. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding our products and the marketing of our products. If we are unable to maintain these strong relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could adversely affect the acceptance of our products in the marketplace and our operating results. Demand for our SilverHawk product in the United States has decreased in recent quarters due in part to the lack of long-term clinical data regarding the safety and efficacy of the SilverHawk, which in part adversely affected our fourth quarter 2007 operating results. Any failure by us to generate additional demand may continue to adversely affect our operating results. In addition, future long-term data regarding the safety and efficacy of the SilverHawk may not be positive or consistent with data currently available, which would adversely affect SilverHawks market acceptance and our operating results. One of the primary reasons we completed the acquisition of FoxHollow was to add FoxHollows SilverHawk and other products to our broad spectrum of technologically advanced products to treat vascular disease in the peripheral market to allow us to offer a more comprehensive and better integrated set of endovascular products to our customers. At the time of the acquisition, we expected sales of the SilverHawk to represent a significant portion of our future net sales. We believe our future success depends in part on the continued commercial success of the SilverHawk. However, demand for the SilverHawk in the United States has decreased in recent quarters. We believe the decrease in demand has been due in part to sales force integration challenges, elevated inventory levels of the product at some of our customers, increased competition and perhaps, most importantly, a lack of long-term clinical data regarding the safety and efficacy of the SilverHawk. Such decreased demand for SilverHawk has had an adverse affect on our net sales and any failure by us to generate additional demand will likely adversely affect our future net sales as well as our other operating results. In light of the decreased demand, we recently retained a third party research firm to help us examine our U.S. atherectomy business. The research firm conducted interviews with a significant number of physicians and sales force representatives and analyzed secondary data to understand factors driving the change in SilverHawk usage and atherectomy procedures. The results of this research confirmed our previously stated belief in the importance of investing in the necessary clinical trials to build the clinical foundation for the SilverHawk and capitalizing on our next generation technologies to expand clinical usage, particularly in treating calcified lesions, total occlusions and longer lesions. Based on this third party research and our own due diligence, we believe that future demand for our SilverHawk will not increase if physicians are not presented with compelling data from long-term studies of the safety and efficacy of the SilverHawk compared against alternative procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting or bypass grafting and alternative technologies. We intend to conduct a multi-center study in which important factors such as long-term data on the rate of restenosis, or plaque regrowth following the procedure, and the corresponding duration of patency, or openness, of the artery. This study may be expensive and time consuming and there are no assurances that the results will prove favorable for the SilverHawk device. If the results do not meet physicians expectations, the SilverHawk may not become widely adopted and physicians may recommend alternative treatments for their patients. Other significant factors that physicians will consider include acute safety data on complications that occur during the SilverHawk procedure. If the results obtained from any future clinical studies or clinical or commercial experience indicate that the SilverHawk is not as safe or effective as other treatment options or as prior short-term or long-term data would suggest, market acceptance of the product may continue to suffer and the number of SilverHawk procedures may continue to 35 Table of Contents decrease, which would harm our business. Even if the data collected from clinical studies or clinical experience indicate positive results, each physicians actual experience with the SilverHawk may vary and may not be as favorable, which would also adversely affect the demand for our SilverHawk product. Other factors that may adversely affect the market acceptance of the SilverHawk include the time required to perform the procedure and the lack of on-board visualization capability. If we do not incorporate certain design improvements to the SilverHawk to respond to these and other physician preferences, we may be unable to generate new customers or retain our existing customers. However, we have limited funds dedicated to research and development; and therefore, we will not be able to pursue all of these suggested design changes. A continued decrease in SilverHawk procedures and any failure by us to generate additional demand for the SilverHawk will likely adversely affect our future net sales as well as our other operating results. Our family of self-expanding stents generates a significant portion of our net sales. Accordingly, if sales of these products were to decline, our operating results and business prospects would be adversely affected. Our self-expanding stents generates a significant portion of our net sales. During 2007, our self-expanding stents generated approximately 26% of our net sales. While the percentage of net sales for our self-expanding stents likely will decrease in future periods as a result of our acquisition of FoxHollow and presumably an expected increase in net sales of our atherectomy products, nonetheless, a decline in net sales from our self-expanding stents and products often sold together with such stents as a result of regulatory, intellectual property or any other reason would negatively impact our operating results and could also negatively impact our product development activities and therefore our business prospects. Our future success depends in part on the introduction of new products. Accordingly, any failure to develop and market new products in a timely fashion that are accepted by the marketplace could adversely affect our business and operating results. We are continually engaged in product development and improvement programs. One of the potential benefits of our acquisition of FoxHollow is that we may have improved cash flow, which should create added resources to fund ongoing, focused research and development programs, future technology innovations and clinical studies to drive the introduction of new products. The introduction of new products represents a significant component of our growth strategy. However, the endovascular device market is highly competitive and designs change often to adjust to patent constraints and to changing market preferences. Therefore, product life cycles are relatively short. If we do not introduce new products and technologies, or if our new products and technologies are not accepted by the physicians who use them or the payors who reimburse the costs of the procedures performed with them, or if there are any delays in our introduction of new products, we may not be successful and our business and operating results would suffer. We plan to introduce additional products during 2008 which we expect to result in additional net sales. We may experience delays in any phase of a product launch, including during research and development, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, manufacturing, marketing and the education process. Many of our clinical trials have durations of several years and it is possible that competing therapies, such as drug therapies, may be introduced while our products are still undergoing clinical trials. In addition, the suppliers of products that we do not manufacture can suffer delays, which could cause delays in our product introductions. New products and technologies introduced by competitors may reach the market earlier, may be more effective or less expensive than our products or render our products obsolete, all of which would harm our business and operating results. 36 Table of Contents A number of our proposed products are in the early stages of development and some are in clinical trials. If the development of these products is not successfully completed or if these trials are unsuccessful, or if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or other regulatory agencies require additional trials to be conducted, these products may not be commercialized and our business prospects may suffer. Several of our products are in the early stages of development. Some only recently emerged from clinical trials and others have not yet reached the clinical trial stage. Our ability to market our products in the United States and abroad depends upon our ability to demonstrate the safety, and in the case of the United States, efficacy, of our products with clinical data to support our requests for regulatory approval. Our products may not be found to be safe and, where required, effective in clinical trials and may not ultimately be approved for marketing by U.S. or foreign regulatory authorities. Our failure to develop safe and effective products that are approved for sale on a timely basis would have a negative impact on our net sales. Our current and anticipated trials for 2008 include the CREATE Post Approval Study (U.S.), DURABILITY I (Europe) Trial, DURABILITY II Trail (U.S.), the PROVE-IT Trial (U.S), PROPSPERO (Europe), the RockHawk SpiderFX Trial (U.S.), the SilverHawk Post Approval Study (U.S.), the Solitaire Stent Flow Restoration Trial, the Solitaire SD Study and the Axium Post Market and Expanded Approvals Trial. There is no assurance that we will be successful in achieving the endpoints in these trials or, if we do, that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve the devices for sale without the need for additional clinical trial data to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Some of the products for which we are currently conducting trials are already approved for sale outside of the United States. As a result, while our trials are ongoing, unfavorable data may arise in connection with usage of our products outside the United States which could adversely impact the approval of such products in the United States. Conversely, unfavorable data from clinical trials in the United States may adversely impact sales of our products outside of the United States. We continually evaluate the potential financial benefits and costs of clinical trials and the products being evaluated in them. If we determine that the costs associated with obtaining regulatory approval of a product exceed the potential financial benefits of that product or if the projected development timeline is inconsistent with our investment horizon, we may choose to stop a clinical trial and/or the development of a product. Our future success depends in part on our ability to sell SilverHawk and our other products internationally. There are risks inherent in operating internationally and selling and shipping our products and purchasing our components internationally, which may adversely impact our net sales, operating results and financial condition. One of the strategic rationales for our acquisition of FoxHollow was to leverage our strong international presence to increase sales of SilverHawk and other products. For the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, 38% and 40%, respectively, of our net sales were derived from our international operations. We expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net sales from operations in international markets. Our international distribution system consisted of seven direct sales offices and approximately 48 stocking distribution partners as of December 31, 2007. In addition, we purchase some of our components and products from international suppliers. The sale and shipping of our products and services across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental trade regulations. Compliance with such regulations is costly and exposes us to penalties for non-compliance. Other laws and regulations that can significantly impact us include various anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, laws restricting business with suspected terrorists and anti-boycott laws. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities, and exclusion or debarment from government contracting. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping and sales activities. 37 Table of Contents In addition, many of the countries in which we sell our products are, to some degree, subject to political, economic and/or social instability. Our international sales operations expose us and our representatives, agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:  the imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations;  the imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements;  the imposition of U.S. and/or international sanctions against a country, company, person or entity with whom the company does business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person or entity;  economic instability;  a shortage of high-quality sales people and distributors;  loss of any key personnel that possess proprietary knowledge, or who are otherwise important to our success in certain international markets;  changes in third-party reimbursement policies that may require some of the patients who receive our products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate the reduction of the selling prices of our products;  changes in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;  the imposition of new trade restrictions;  the imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;  scrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us;  pricing pressure that we may experience internationally;  laws and business practices favoring local companies;  significantly longer payment cycles;  difficulties in maintaining consistency with our internal guidelines;  difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;  difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights; and  exposure to different legal and political standards due to our conducting business in over 50 countries. No assurance can be given that one or more of the factors will not harm our business. Any material decrease in our international sales would adversely impact our net sales, operating results and financial condition. Our international sales are predominately in Europe. In Europe, health care regulation and reimbursement for medical devices vary significantly from country to country. This changing environment could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in some European countries. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported net sales and earnings. Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results. Approximately 27% and 29% of our net sales during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were denominated in foreign currencies. We expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales in the future. Approximately 76% and 71% of our net sales denominated in foreign currencies during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were derived from European Union countries and were denominated in the Euro. Additionally, we have significant intercompany receivables from our foreign subsidiaries, which are denominated in foreign currencies, principally the Euro and the Yen. Our principal exchange rate risks therefore exist between the 38 Table of Contents U.S. dollar and the Euro and between the U.S. dollar and the Yen. Our international net sales were favorably affected by the impact of foreign currency fluctuations totaling $6.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 and favorably affected by $443,000 during the year ended December 31, 2006. We cannot assure you that we will benefit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in the future and foreign currency fluctuations in the future may adversely affect our net sales and earnings. At present, we do not engage in hedging transactions to protect against uncertainty in future exchange rates between particular foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. If we engage in hedging activities in the future, such activities involve risk and may not limit our underlying exposure from currency fluctuations or minimize our net sales and earnings volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes. If third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling the affected product. The medical device industry is litigious with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies operating in our industry routinely seek patent protection for their product designs, and many of our principal competitors have large patent portfolios. Companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. We face the risk of claims that we have infringed on third parties intellectual property rights. We are aware of patents held by Abbott Laboratories that may be asserted against our FoxHollow subsidiary in litigation that could be costly and limit our ability to sell the SilverHawk or other products. One of FoxHollows founders, John B. Simpson, Ph.D., M.D. founded a company prior to founding FoxHollow that developed an atherectomy device that is currently sold by Abbott, and he is a listed inventor on several patents covering that device. Abbotts device is currently marketed and sold for use in coronary arteries. Although we are not currently aware of any claims Abbott has made or intends to make against FoxHollow, because of a doctrine known as assignor estoppel, if any of Dr. Simpsons earlier patents are asserted against FoxHollow by Abbott, we may be prevented from asserting an invalidity defense regarding those patents, and our defense may be compromised. Abbott has significantly greater financial resources than us to pursue patent litigation and could assert these patent families against us at any time. Any adverse determinations in such litigation could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our SilverHawk or other products, which would have a significant adverse impact on our business. Prior to launching major new products in our key markets, we normally evaluate existing intellectual property rights. However, our competitors may also have filed for patent protection which is not as yet a matter of public knowledge or claim trademark rights that have not been revealed through our availability searches. Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing on third parties intellectual property rights may not always be successful. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could:  be expensive and time consuming to defend;  result in us being required to pay significant damages to third parties;  cause us to cease making or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;  require us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products, if feasible;  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third partys intellectual property, which agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all;  divert the attention of our management; or  result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation. In addition, new patents obtained by our competitors could threaten a products continued life in the market even after it has already been introduced. 39 Table of Contents We are currently a party to a number of intellectual property claims, which are costly to defend and the resolution of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are a party to a patent infringement lawsuit with Boston Scientific pursuant to which Boston Scientific claims, among other things, that some of our products, including our SpiderRX Embolic Protection Device, infringes certain of Boston Scientifics patents and our misappropriation of trade secrets. We are also a party to several legal patent infringement actions in the United States and Europe related to our Sapphire coils. Although we have recently entered into agreements in principle with the parties to these matters to settle them, such matters will not be finally resolved until we have entered into final and binding written settlement agreements with the parties. We cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into such written agreements. These litigation matters have been very costly to defend and if we are not able to enter into written settlement agreements with the parties, we will be forced to continue to defend the litigation, which will continue to adversely affect our operating results and the resolution of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products, we may lose market share to our competitors, which would harm our business. Our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products. We rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright and trademark laws and nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. In addition, we cannot be assured that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent to us. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications, and patents issued as a result of the pending patent applications, if any, may not provide us with significant commercial protection or be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. We could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the PTO. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products. Litigation may also be necessary to enforce patent rights we hold or to protect trade secrets or techniques we own. Intellectual property litigation is costly and may adversely affect our operating results. Although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, there is no assurance that third parties will not be able to design around our patents. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meaningfully protect all of our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology. We seek to protect our know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology, in part with confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, independent distributors and consultants. However, such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event that our competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information. In addition, we rely on the use of registered trademarks with respect to the brand names of some of our products. We also rely on common law trademark protection for some brand names, which are not protected to the same extent as our rights in the use of our registered trademarks. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, foreign countries generally do not allow patents to cover methods for performing surgical procedures. If we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries, our competitors may be able to compete more directly with us, which could adversely affect our competitive position and business. We also hold licenses from third parties that are necessary to use certain technologies used in the design and manufacturing of some of our products. The loss of such licenses would prevent us from manufacturing, marketing and selling these products, which could harm our business and operating results. 40 Table of Contents We manufacture our products at single locations. Any disruption in these manufacturing facilities, any patent infringement claims with respect to our manufacturing process or otherwise any inability to manufacture a sufficient number of our products to meet demand could adversely affect our business and operating results. We rely on our manufacturing facilities in Plymouth, Minnesota and in Irvine and Redwood City, California. We are in the process of consolidating the production of our Rinspirator product into our Redwood City manufacturing facility. Equipment qualification, process development and process validations are complete and we are awaiting the necessary regulatory approval to resume production in Redwood City. During this transition, we may experience difficulties that could impact our ability to meet the demand for the Rinspirator products, which could adversely affect our operating results. Any damage or destruction to our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead-time to repair or replace. Our facilities may be affected by natural or man-made disasters. In the event that one of our facilities was affected by a disaster, we would be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers if we could not shift production to our other manufacturing facilities. In the case of a device with a premarket approval application, we might in such event be required to obtain prior FDA or notified body approval of an alternate manufacturing facility, which could delay or prevent our marketing of the affected product until such approval is obtained. Although we believe that we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. It is also possible that one of our competitors could claim that our manufacturing process violates an existing patent. If we were unsuccessful in defending such a claim, we might be forced to stop production at one of our manufacturing facilities in the United States and to seek alternative facilities. Even if we were able to identify such alternative facilities, we might incur additional costs and experience a disruption in the supply of our products until those facilities are available. Any disruption in our manufacturing capacity could have an adverse impact on our ability to produce sufficient inventory of our products or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory, and therefore would adversely affect our net sales and operating results. We have limited experience in manufacturing our products in commercial quantities and therefore may encounter unforeseen situations that could result in delays or shortfalls. Manufacturers often experience difficulties in increasing production, including problems with production yields and quality control and assurance. In June 2004, FoxHollow initiated a voluntary recall of two lots of the SilverHawk due to the possibility of improper sterilization at one of two approved sterilization facilities. Any disruption or delay at our manufacturing facilities, any inability to accurately predict the number of products to manufacture or to expand our manufacturing capabilities if necessary could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and these customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our dependence on key suppliers puts us at risk of interruptions in the availability of our products, which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, increases in prices for raw materials and components used in our products could adversely affect our operating results. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and components used in our products. For reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness or availability, we procure certain raw materials and components from sole and limited source suppliers. We generally acquire such raw materials and components through purchase orders placed in the ordinary course of business, and as a result we do not have a significant inventory of these materials and components and do not have any guaranteed or contractual supply arrangements with many of these suppliers. In addition, we also rely on independent contract manufacturers for some of our products. Independent manufacturers have possession of, and in some cases hold title to, molds for certain manufactured components of our products. Our dependence on third-party suppliers involves several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery schedules, as well as manufacturing yields and costs. Suppliers of raw materials and components may decide, or be required, for reasons beyond our control to cease supplying raw materials and components to us or to raise their prices. 41 Table of Contents Shortages of raw materials, quality control problems, production capacity constraints or delays by our contract manufacturers could negatively affect our ability to meet our production obligations and result in increased prices for affected parts. Any such shortage, constraint or delay may result in delays in shipments of our products or components, which could adversely affect our net sales and operating results. Increases in prices for raw materials and components used in our products could also adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the FDA and foreign regulators may require additional testing of any raw materials or components from new suppliers prior to our use of these materials or components. In the case of a device with a premarket approval application, we may be required to obtain prior FDA approval of a new supplier, which could delay or prevent our access or use of such raw materials or components or our marketing of affected products until such approval is granted. In the case of a device with clearance under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, referred to as a 510(k), We may be required to submit a new 510(k) if a change in a raw material or component supplier results in a change in a material or component supplied that is not within the 510(k) cleared device specifications. If we need to establish additional or replacement suppliers for some of these components, our access to the components might be delayed while we qualify such suppliers and obtain any necessary FDA approvals. Our suppliers of finished goods also are subject to regulatory inspection and scrutiny. Any adverse regulatory finding or action against those suppliers could impact their ability to supply us raw materials and components for our products. Significant and unexpected claims under our EverFlex self-expanding stent worldwide fracture-free guarantee program in excess of our reserves could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Beginning in October 2006, we began providing a worldwide fracture-free guarantee as part of our marketing and advertising strategy for our EverFlex self-expanding stents. In the event that an EverFlex self-expanding stent should fracture within two years of implantation, we have agreed to provide a free replacement product to the medical facility, subject to the terms and conditions of the program. Although we have tested our EverFlex self-expanding stents in rigorous simulated fatigue testing, we commercially launched our EverFlex self-expanding stents on a worldwide basis in early March 2006 and, therefore, in only some cases, have two years of commercial data on which to base our expected claim rates under the program. We may receive significant and unexpected claims under this guarantee program that could exceed the amount of our reserves for the program. Significant claims in excess of our program reserves could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Our inability to successfully grow through future acquisitions, our failure to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing operations or our discovery of previously undisclosed liabilities could negatively affect our business and operating results. In order to build our core technology platforms, we have acquired several businesses since our inception. In October 2007, we completed our acquisition of FoxHollow. In September 2006, FoxHollow acquired Kerberos Proximal Solutions, Inc. In January 2006, we acquired the outstanding shares of Micro Therapeutics, Inc. that we did not already own. We expect to continue to actively pursue additional acquisitions of, investments in or alliances with, other companies and businesses in the future as a component of our business strategy. Our ability to grow through future acquisitions, investments and alliances will depend upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate attractive candidates on favorable terms and to obtain any necessary financing. Our inability to complete one or more acquisitions, investments or alliances could impair our ability to develop our product lines and to compete against many industry participants, many of whom have product lines broader than ours. Acquisitions, investments and alliances, including our acquisition of FoxHollow and our and FoxHollows previous acquisitions, involve risks, including:  difficulties in integrating any acquired companies, personnel and products into our existing business;  delays in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings, revenue synergies and other benefits of the acquired company or products;  inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems; 42 Table of Contents  diversion of our managements time and attention from other business concerns;  limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter;  higher costs of integration than we anticipated; or  difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions. For example, we had difficulties integrating our and FoxHollows U.S. peripheral vascular sales forces. In addition, our acquisition of FoxHollow resulted in our need to defend additional litigation, both existing litigation of FoxHollow and additional litigation of FoxHollow that was commenced or threatened after announcement of our proposed acquisition of FoxHollow. After our announcement of our proposed acquisition of FoxHollow, FoxHollow received a letter from counsel for the shareholder representatives of Kerberos alleging that FoxHollow has not used commercially reasonable efforts to market, promote, sell and distribute Kerberos Rinspirator products, as required under the agreement and plan of merger between FoxHollow and Kerberos. In addition, an acquisition, investment or alliance could materially impair our operating results and liquidity by causing us to incur debt or reallocate amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or requiring us to amortize transaction expenses and acquired assets, incur non-recurring charges as a result of incorrect estimates made in the accounting for such transactions or record asset impairment charges. We may also discover deficiencies in internal controls, data adequacy and integrity, product quality, regulatory compliance and product liabilities which we did not uncover prior to our acquisition of such businesses, which could result in us becoming subject to penalties or other liabilities. Any difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses or unexpected penalties or liabilities in connection with such businesses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. These risks could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time. Charges resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting relating to our acquisition of FoxHollow may adversely affect the market value of our common stock following the acquisition. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are considered the acquirer of FoxHollow for accounting purposes. We have accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting, which has resulted and may continue to result in charges to our earnings, if any, that could adversely affect the market value of our common stock. Under the purchase method of accounting, we have allocated the total purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from FoxHollow based on their fair values as of October 4, 2007, the date of the completion of the acquisition, and have recorded any excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. We have incurred and will continue to incur amortization expense over the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition. In addition, to the extent the value of goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of that asset. These amortization and potential impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant transaction and integration-related costs in connection with our acquisition of FoxHollow and the integration of FoxHollows operations into ours. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with our acquisition of FoxHollow and integrating FoxHollows operations with ours. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses resulting from the acquisition will be comprised of transaction costs related to the acquisition, employment-related costs and facilities and systems consolidation costs. Although we currently estimate one-time transaction and integration-related cash payments relating to the acquisition to be between approximately $71 million to $73 million, this estimate may prove to be inaccurate and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the 43 Table of Contents integration of the businesses should allow us to offset incremental transaction and integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. The demand for our products, the prices which customers and patients are willing to pay for our products and the number of procedures performed using our products depend upon the ability of our customers and patients to obtain sufficient third party reimbursement for their purchases of our products. Sales of our products depend in part on sufficient reimbursement by governmental and private health care payors to our physician customers or their patients for the purchase and use of our products. In the United States, health care providers that purchase our products generally rely on third-party payors, principally federal Medicare, state Medicaid and private health insurance plans, to pay for all or a portion of the cost of endovascular procedures. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country, and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis and can take up to 18 months or longer. Many international markets have government-managed health care systems that govern reimbursement for new devices and procedures. In most markets, there are private insurance systems as well as government-managed systems. Additionally, some foreign reimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and therefore result in extended payment periods. Any delays in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, reimbursement approvals or sufficient reimbursement for our products could significantly affect the acceptance of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if the reimbursement policies of domestic or foreign governmental or private health care payors were to change, our customers would likely change their purchasing patterns and/or the frequency of their purchases of the affected products. Additionally, payors continue to review their coverage policies carefully for existing and new therapies and can, without notice, deny coverage for treatments that include the use of our products. Our business would be negatively impacted to the extent any such changes reduce reimbursement for our products. Healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. There have been and may continue to be proposals by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to keep these costs down. The continuing efforts of governments, insurance companies and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce these costs, combined with closer scrutiny of such costs, could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payors. The cost containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting both in the United States and internationally could harm our business. Some health care providers in the United States have adopted or are considering a managed care system in which the providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per person. Health care providers may attempt to control costs by authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures or by requiring the use of the least expensive devices possible, which could adversely affect the demand for our products or the price at which we can sell our products. We also sell a number of our products to physician customers who may elect to use these products in ways that are not within the scope of the approval or clearance given by the FDA, often referred to as off-label use. In the event that governmental or private health care payors limit reimbursement for products used off-label, sales of our products and our business would be materially adversely affected. Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or to the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. Because healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to create new companies with greater market power, including hospitals. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and will continue to become more intense. This in turn has resulted and will likely continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers. We expect that market demand, 44 Table of Contents government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances, which may increase competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of their products and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results. Our products and our product development and marketing activities are subject to extensive regulation as a result of which we may not be able to obtain required regulatory approvals for our products in a cost-effective manner or at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. The production and marketing of our products and our ongoing research and development, preclinical testing and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. U.S. and foreign regulations applicable to medical devices are wide-ranging and govern, among other things, the development, testing, marketing and premarket review of new medical devices, in addition to regulating manufacturing practices, reporting, advertising, exporting, labeling and record keeping procedures. We are required to obtain FDA approval or clearance before we can market our products in the United States and certain foreign countries. The regulatory process requires significant time, effort and expenditures to bring products to market, and it is possible that our products will not be approved for sale. Even if regulatory approval or clearance of a product is granted, it may not be granted within the timeframe that we expect, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, even if regulatory approval or clearance of a product is granted, the approval or clearance could limit the uses for which the product may be labeled and promoted, which may limit the market for our products. Even after a product is approved or cleared by the FDA, we may have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations, non-compliance of which could result in the subsequent withdrawal of such approvals or clearances, or such approvals or clearances could be withdrawn due to the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. We also are subject to medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to the FDA if any of our products causes or contributes to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were it to occur might cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Any failure to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances on a timely basis or the subsequent withdrawal of such approvals or clearances could prevent us from successfully marketing our products, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in governmental agencies:  imposing fines and penalties on us;  preventing us from manufacturing or selling our products;  bringing civil or criminal charges against us;  delaying the introduction of our new products into the market;  suspending any ongoing clinical trials;  issuing an injunction preventing us from manufacturing or selling our products or imposing restrictions;  recalling or seizing our products; or  withdrawing or denying approvals or clearances for our products. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may also result in us not being able to meet the demands of our customers and our customers canceling orders or purchasing products from our competitors, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. When required, with respect to the products we market in the United States, we have obtained premarket notification clearance under section 510(k), but do not believe certain modifications we have made to our products require us to submit new 510(k) notifications. However, if the FDA disagrees with us and requires us to submit a new 510(k) notification for modifications to our existing products, we may be subject to enforcement actions by the FDA and be required to stop marketing the products while the FDA reviews the 45 Table of Contents 510(k) notification. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination than we had expected, our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline. In addition, the FDA may determine that future products will require the more costly, lengthy and uncertain premarket approval application process. Products that are approved through a premarket approval application generally need FDA approval before they can be modified. If we fail to submit changes to products developed under IDEs or premarket approval applications in a timely or adequate manner, we may become subject to regulatory actions. In addition, we market our products in select countries outside of the United States. In order to market our products abroad, we are required to obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous requirements. If additional regulatory requirements are implemented in the foreign countries in which we sell our products, the cost of developing or selling our products may increase. For example, recent regulations in Japan have increased the regulatory and quality assurance requirements in order to obtain and maintain regulatory approval to market our products in Japan. These regulations resulted in higher costs and delays in securing approval to market our products in Japan. We depend on our distributors outside the United States in seeking regulatory approval to market our devices in other countries and we therefore are dependent on persons outside of our direct control to secure such approvals. For example, we are highly dependent on distributors in emerging markets such as China and Brazil for regulatory submissions and approvals and do not have direct access to health care agencies in those markets to ensure timely regulatory approvals or prompt resolution of regulatory or compliance matters. If our distributors fail to obtain the required approvals or do not do so in a timely manner, our net sales from our international operations and our operating results may be adversely affected. Our marketing activities are subject to regulation regarding the promotion of off-label uses, which restrict our ability to market our products and could adversely affect our growth. Any off-label use of our products may result in injuries that could lead to product liability claims against us. We sell a number of our products to physicians who may elect to use the products in ways that are not within the scope of the approval or clearance given by the FDA or for other than FDA-approved indications, often referred to as off-label use. While off-label uses of medical devices are common and the FDA does not regulate physicians choice of treatments, the FDA does restrict a manufacturers communications regarding such off-label use. Such laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of products for off-label use restrict our ability to market our products and could adversely affect our growth. Although we have strict policies against the unlawful promotion of products for off-label use and we train our employees on these policies, it is possible that one or more of our employees will not follow the policies, or that regulations would change in a way that may hinder our ability to sell such products or make it more costly to do so, which could expose us to financial penalties as well as loss of approval to market and sell the affected products. If physicians cease or lessen their use of products for other than FDA-approved indications, sales of our products could decline, which could materially adversely affect our net sales and operating results. In addition, it is our understanding that certain biliary stent manufacturers recently have become involved in civil investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice alleging that they have improperly promoted their biliary stents for off-label uses. Although we have received no notice of any such investigation involving the sales practices of our biliary stents, no assurance can be provided that we will not become the subject of such an investigation, which could adversely affect our business and stock price. If we want to market any of our products for use in ways for which they are not currently approved, we may need to conduct clinical trials and obtain approval from appropriate regulatory bodies, which could be time-consuming and costly. For example, our SilverHawk received FDA approval for the treatment of atherosclerosis in the peripheral vasculature, which restricts our ability to market or advertise the SilverHawk for any specific indication within the peripheral arteries. Off-label use of the SilverHawk outside the peripheral vasculature, in coronary and carotid arteries, has occurred and is likely to continue. In addition, off-label use for treatment of in-stent restenosis has occurred and is likely to continue. We are not able to promote or advertise the SilverHawk for off-label uses or make comparative claims regarding the use of the SilverHawk against any alternative treatments without conducting head-to-head comparative clinical studies, which would 46 Table of Contents be expensive and time consuming. If we desire to market the SilverHawk in the United States for use in coronary or carotid arteries, we will need to conduct further clinical trials and obtain premarket approval from the FDA. Although FoxHollow previously began a clinical trial in support of FDA approval for use of the SilverHawk in the coronary arteries, it voluntarily halted enrollment so that it could incorporate safety and design improvements into the coronary product. To market the SilverHawk in the United States for this use, we must successfully complete a clinical trial, submit a premarket approval application to the FDA and obtain premarket approval. No assurance can be given that the results of such a trial will adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the SilverHawk for use in coronary arteries. Off-label use of our product may not be safe or effective and may result in unfavorable outcomes to patients, resulting in potential liability to us. For example, the use or misuse of the SilverHawk in the peripheral and coronary arteries has in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in complications, including damage to the treated artery, internal bleeding, limb loss and death, potentially leading to a product liability claim. Penalties or liabilities stemming from off-label use could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. If we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market, we may be required to withdraw our products from the market, which would hinder or preclude our ability to generate net sales. As part of our post-market regulatory responsibilities for our products classified as medical devices, we are required to report all serious injuries or deaths involving our products, and any malfunctions where a serious injury or death would be likely if the malfunction were to recur. If we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market:  regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals;  we may be required to reformulate our products;  we may have to recall the affected products from the market and may not be able to reintroduce them onto the market;  our reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and  we may become the target of lawsuits, including class action suits. Any of these events could harm or prevent sales of the affected products or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing or marketing these products. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to extensive governmental regulation with which compliance is costly and which expose us to penalties for non-compliance. We and our third party manufacturers are required to register with the FDA as device manufacturers and as a result, we and our third party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA for compliance with the FDAs Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us and our third party manufacturers to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. We are also subject to similar state requirements and licenses. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, certifications in order to sell products and we are required to undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. If we or our manufacturers fail to adhere to QSR or ISO requirements, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties and delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances, the withdrawal of regulatory approvals and clearances, recalls or other consequences, which could in turn have a material adverse 47 Table of Contents effect on our financial condition and operating results. In addition, regulatory agencies may not agree with the extent or speed of corrective actions relating to product or manufacturing problems. Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety, and other laws and regulations, with which compliance is costly and which expose us to penalties for non-compliance. Our business, properties and products are subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, natural resources and worker health and safety and the use, management, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, and other regulated materials. Because we operate real property, various environmental laws also may impose liability on us for the costs of cleaning up and responding to hazardous substances that may have been released on our property, including releases unknown to us. FoxHollows leased Redwood City facility sits on property formerly occupied by Rohm & Haas and Occidental Chemical Company and contains residual contamination in soil and groundwater from these past industrial operations. Rohm & Haas and Occidental Chemical Company previously performed soil remediation on the property under the supervision of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board. Rohm & Haas has indemnified the owner of the facility and its tenants against costs associated with the residual contamination, but there can be no assurance that this indemnification will be adequate to cover the extent of the liability. These environmental laws and regulations also could require us to pay for environmental remediation and response costs at third-party locations where we disposed of or recycled hazardous substances. The costs of complying with these various environmental requirements, as they now exist or may be altered in the future, could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Our quarterly operating and financial results may fluctuate in future periods. Our quarterly operating and financial results may fluctuate from period to period. Some of the factors that may influence our quarterly operating results include:  the seasonality of our product sales, which typically results in higher demand in our fourth fiscal quarter and lower sales volumes in our third fiscal quarter;  the mix of our products sold;  demand for, and pricing of, our products;  timing of or failure to obtain regulatory approvals for products;  costs, benefits and timing of new product introductions;  the timing and extent of promotional pricing or volume discounts;  the timing of larger orders by customers and the timing of shipment of such orders;  field inventory levels;  changes in average selling prices;  the availability and cost of components and materials; and  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Because of these factors, our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline significantly. We may become obligated to make large milestone payments that are not reflected in our financial statements in certain circumstances, which would negatively impact our cash flows from operations. Pursuant to the acquisition agreements relating to our purchase of MitraLife and Appriva Medical, Inc. in 2002, we agreed to make additional payments to the sellers of these businesses in the event that we achieve contractually defined milestones. Generally, in each case, these milestone payments become due upon the completion of specific regulatory steps in the product commercialization process. With respect to the MitraLife 48 Table of Contents acquisition, the maximum potential milestone payments totaled $25 million, and with respect to the Appriva acquisition, the maximum potential milestone payments totaled $175 million. Although we do not believe that it is likely that these milestone payment obligations became due, or will become due in the future, the former stockholders of Appriva disagree with our position and have brought litigation against us making a claim for such payments and it is possible that the former stockholders of MitraLife could also disagree with our position and make a claim for such payments. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement relating to FoxHollows purchase of Kerberos Proximal Solutions, Inc., FoxHollow has agreed to pay certain earnout payments which are capped at $117 million upon the achievement of contractually defined net sales milestones. On August 20, 2007, FoxHollow received a letter from counsel for the shareholder representatives of Kerberos alleging that FoxHollow has not used commercially reasonable efforts to market, promote, sell and distribute Kerberos Rinspirator products, as required under the agreement and plan of merger. There can be no assurance that the stockholder representatives of Kerberos will not commence litigation on the alleged claims. The defense of the outstanding litigation related to our Appriva acquisition and the outstanding claims related to FoxHollows Kerberos acquisition is, and any such additional dispute with MitraLife would likely be, costly and time-consuming and divert our managements time and attention away from our business. In the event any such milestone payments become due and/or any other damages become payable, our costs would increase correspondingly which would negatively impact our cash flow from operations. We rely on independent sales distributors and sales associates to market and sell our products outside of the United States, Canada and Europe. Our future success outside of the United States, Canada and Europe depends largely upon marketing arrangements with independent sales distributors and sales associates, in particular their sales and service expertise and relationships with the customers in the marketplace. Independent distributors and sales associates may terminate their relationship with us, or devote insufficient sales efforts to our products. We are not able to control our independent distributors and they may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans. In addition, many of our independent distributors outside of the United States, Canada and Europe initially obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approval for sale of our products in their respective countries. Our failure to maintain our relationships with our independent distributors and sales associates outside of the United States, Canada and Europe, or our failure to recruit and retain additional skilled independent sales distributors and sales associates in these locations, could have an adverse effect on our operations. We have experienced turnover with some of our independent distributors in the past that has adversely affected our short-term financial results while we transitioned to new independent distributors. Similar occurrences could happen to us in the future. If we fail to comply with the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. A provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services payable by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal health care program. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is very broad in scope and many of its provisions have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted by existing case law or regulations, and thus are subject to evolving interpretations. In addition, most of the states in which our products are sold have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these laws are even broader than the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute in that their prohibitions are not limited to items or services paid for by a federal health care program but, instead, apply regardless of the source of payment. Violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. All of our financial relationships with health care providers and others who provide products or services to federal health care program beneficiaries are potentially governed by the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. While we believe our operations are in material compliance with the Federal Anti-Kickback 49 Table of Contents Statute and similar state laws, no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to investigations or litigation alleging violations of these laws, which could be time-consuming and costly to us and could divert managements attention from operating our business, and which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if our arrangements were found to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state laws, we or our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties, including, for example, exclusion from participation in any federal health care programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and operating results. If our distribution agreement with Invatec Technology Center GmbH expires or terminates and we are unable to commercially launch on a timely basis our own products to replace the products we currently distribute for Invatec in the United States or if we are unable to enter into a substitute arrangement with another third party or if there is a disruption in the supply of Invatec products that we distribute, our net sales and operating results would be adversely impacted. We have entered into an agreement with Invatec Technology Center GmbH, or Invatec, an Italian manufacturer of endovascular medical devices to distribute on a non-exclusive basis some of Invatecs branded products throughout the United States. This arrangement provides us with a broad portfolio of commercially competitive products that complement our existing portfolio. The Invatec products that we distribute include the Sailor Plus, Submarine Plus, Admiral Xtreme and Amphirion Deep PTA catheters and the Diver C.E. Thrombus Aspiration Catheter. The term of our agreement with Invatec expires on December 31, 2008, however, we continue to have the right to sell our remaining inventory of Invatec products through June 30, 2008. If the agreement expires or terminates and we are unable to commercially launch on a timely basis our own products to replace the products we currently distribute for Invatec in the United States or if we are unable to enter into a substitute arrangement with another third party, our net sales and operating results would be adversely impacted. In addition, if Invatec is unable to produce enough products to meet our demands, including if Invatec sells its inventory to our competitors rather than to us for marketing under their own brands, we may not be able to meet our customers demands and our net sales and operating results may suffer. We are exposed to product liability claims that could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. The design, manufacture and sale of medical devices expose us to significant risk of product liability claims, some of which may have a negative impact on our business. Most of our products were developed relatively recently and defects or risks that we have not yet identified may give rise to product liability claims. Our product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we may incur or we may not be able to maintain adequate product liability insurance at acceptable rates. If a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage and it is ultimately determined that we are liable, our business could suffer. Additionally, we could experience a material design defect or manufacturing failure in our products, a quality system failure, other safety issues or heightened regulatory scrutiny that would warrant a recall of some of our products. A recall of our products could also result in increased product liability claims. Further, while we train our physician customers on the proper usage of our products, there can be no assurance that they will implement our instructions accurately. If our products are used incorrectly by our customers, injury may result and this could give rise to product liability claims against us. Even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry, lead to significant legal fees and could result in the diversion of managements attention from managing our business and may have a negative impact on our business and our operating results. In addition, successful product liability claims against one of our competitors could cause claims to be made against us. Our net sales could decline significantly if drug-eluting stents become a dominant therapy in the peripheral vascular stent market and we are not able to develop or acquire a drug-eluting stent to market and sell. The peripheral vascular market is currently comprised exclusively of bare metal, or non drug-eluting, stents. However, there are clinical situations in the periphery in which a drug-eluting stent may demonstrate 50 Table of Contents clinical superiority over bare metal stents. To the extent that our peripheral stent customers seek stents with drug coatings and we do not market and sell a drug-eluting peripheral stent or one that achieves market acceptance, we may not be able to compete as effectively with those of our competitors that are able to develop and sell a drug-eluting stent, and our peripheral stent sales could decline. If our peripheral stent sales were to decline, we could experience a significant decline in sales of affiliated products which are routinely purchased in conjunction with our stents. We face competition from other companies, many of which have substantially greater resources than us and may be able to more effectively develop, market and sell their products than we can, which could adversely impact our business, net sales and operating results. Consolidation in the medical technology industry would exacerbate these risks. The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Although our competitors range from small start-up companies to much larger companies, the markets for most of our products, other than our atherectomy products, are dominated by a small number of large companies, including Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific Corporation, Cook Incorporated, Cordis Corporation (a Johnson & Johnson company) and Medtronic, Inc. Despite our acquisition of FoxHollow, we are still a much smaller company relative to our primary competitors. Our products compete with other medical devices, including Invatec-manufactured products sold in the United States under other brand names, surgical procedures and pharmaceutical products. A number of the companies in the medical technology industry, including manufacturers of peripheral vascular, cardiovascular and neurovascular products, have substantially greater capital resources, larger customer bases, broader product lines, larger sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs and larger facilities than ours and have established reputations and relationships with our target customers, as well as worldwide distribution channels that are more effective than ours. Within the atherectomy market, although we believe our SilverHawk product competes favorably against other competing technologies, surgical procedures and pharmaceutical products, recently introduced atherectomy products or products that will likely be introduced to the market shortly may adversely affect future sales of our SilverHawk product. Because of the size of the vascular disease market opportunity, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to aggressively promote their products and develop new and improved products. Our competitors and potential competitors may develop technologies and products that are safer, more effective, easier to use, less expensive or more readily accepted than ours. Their products could make our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. None of our customers have long-term purchase agreements with us and may at any time switch to the use of our competitors products. Our competitors may also be able to achieve more efficient manufacturing and distribution operations than we can and may offer lower prices than we could offer profitably. We expect that as our products mature, we will be able to produce our products in a more cost effective manner and therefore be able to compete more effectively, but it is possible that we may not achieve such cost reductions. Any of these competitive factors could adversely impact our business, net sales and operating results. In addition, the industry has recently experienced some consolidation. For example, during 2007, Hologic, Inc. merged with Cytyc Corporation, Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. acquired Cholestech Corporation and HemoSense, Inc. and Medtronic, Inc. acquired Kyphon Inc. Consolidation could make the competitive environment even more difficult for smaller companies and exacerbate these risks. We also compete with other manufacturers of medical devices for clinical sites to conduct human trials. If we are not able to locate clinical sites on a timely or cost-effective basis, this could impede our ability to conduct trials of our products and, therefore, our ability to obtain required regulatory clearance or approval. 51 Table of Contents We rely on our management information systems for inventory management, distribution and other functions and to maintain our research and development and clinical data. If our information systems fail to adequately perform these functions or if we experience an interruption in their operation, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems, on which we rely to effectively manage accounting and financial functions; manage order entry, order fulfillment and inventory replenishment processes; and to maintain research and development and clinical data. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and product development and could result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages, causing our business and operating results to suffer. In addition, our management information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:  earthquake, fire, flood and other natural disasters;  terrorist attacks and attacks by computer viruses or hackers; and  power loss or computer systems, Internet, telecommunications or data network failure. Any such interruption could adversely affect our business and operating results. The restrictive covenants in our loan agreement could limit our ability to conduct our business and respond to changing economic and business conditions and may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that are subject to fewer restrictions. Our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank requires our compliance with a liquidity ratio. Our failure to comply with this financial covenant could adversely affect our financial condition. The loan agreement limits our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:  transfer all or any part of our business or properties;  permit or suffer a change in control;  merge or consolidate, or acquire any entity;  engage in any material new line of business;  incur additional indebtedness or liens with respect to any of their properties;  pay dividends or make any other distribution on or purchase of, any of their capital stock;  make investments in other companies; or  engage in related party transactions, subject in each case to certain exceptions and limitations. As of December 31, 2007, we had $10.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the equipment line of credit, no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit and $2.4 million of outstanding letters of credit issued by Silicon Valley Bank. As of December 31, 2007, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $90.8 million. In light of the amount of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the amounts outstanding under the loan agreement, it is possible that if we needed to we could pay off the outstanding amounts under the loan agreement at this time. However, it is also possible that if we do not generate cash from operations as we anticipate or if we incur significant unanticipated costs that we may need the flexibility provided under our Silicon Valley Bank loan agreement. The restrictive covenants under the loan agreement could limit our ability, and that of certain of our subsidiaries, to obtain future financing, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. The financial and restrictive covenants contained in the loan agreement could also adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic and business conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer restrictions. Transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as 52 Table of Contents acquisitions, may be subject to the consent of Silicon Valley Bank, which consent may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of these restrictions and covenants at all times, especially the financial covenant. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants will depend on the success of our business and our operating results and may also be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of the restrictions or covenants in the loan agreement by us or certain of our subsidiaries could lead to an event of default under the terms of the credit agreement, notwithstanding our ability to meet the debt service obligations thereunder. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the loan agreement, Silicon Valley Bank has available a range of remedies customary in these circumstances, including declaring all such debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to be due and payable, foreclosing on the assets securing the loan agreement and/or ceasing to provide additional revolving loans or letters of credit, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Although it is possible we could negotiate a waiver with Silicon Valley Bank of an event of default, such a waiver would likely involve significant costs. If we become profitable, we cannot assure you that our net operating losses will be available to reduce our tax liability. Our ability to use, or the amount of, our net operating losses may be limited or reduced. Generally under section 382 of the Code, in the event of an ownership change of a company, the company is only allowed to use a limited amount of its net operating losses arising prior to the ownership change for each taxable year thereafter. As a result of prior transactions effected by us and as a result of our acquisition of FoxHollow, our ability to use our and FoxHollows existing net operating losses to offset U.S. federal taxable income if we become profitable may be subject to substantial limitations. These limitations could potentially result in increased future tax liability for us. A substantial portion of our assets consist of goodwill and an impairment in the value of our goodwill would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses. As of December 31, 2007, goodwill represented $586.6 million, or 54%, of our total assets. If we are required to record an impairment charge to earnings relating to goodwill, it will have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses. The accounting standards on goodwill and other intangible assets require goodwill to be reviewed at least annually for impairment, and do not permit amortization. In the event that impairment is identified, a charge to earnings will be recorded and our stock price may decline as a result. Risks Related to our Common Stock One of our principal stockholders and its affiliates are able to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and could discourage the purchase of our outstanding shares at a premium. As of March 3, 2008, Warburg Pincus beneficially owned approximately 29.8% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, under a holders agreement, we are required to nominate and use our best efforts to have elected to our board of directors two persons designated by Warburg, Pincus and certain of its affiliates, which we refer to collectively as the Warburg Pincus Entities, and Vertical Fund I, L.P. and Vertical Fund II, L.P., which we refer to together as the Vertical Funds, if the Warburg Pincus Entities, the Vertical Funds and their affiliates collectively beneficially own 20% or more of our common stock. As a result of Warburg Pincus share ownership and representation on our board of directors, Warburg Pincus is able to influence our affairs and actions, including matters requiring stockholder approval, such as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of Warburg Pincus may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. For example, Warburg Pincus could oppose a third party offer to acquire us that the other stockholders might consider attractive, and the third party may not be able or willing to proceed unless Warburg Pincus, as one of our significant stockholders, supports the offer. Warburg Pincus concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale or 53 Table of Contents merger of our company and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Transactions that could be affected by this concentration of ownership include proxy contests, tender offers, mergers or other purchases of common stock that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for shares of our common stock. In such case and in similar situations, our other stockholders may disagree with Warburg Pincus as to whether the action opposed or supported by Warburg Pincus is in the best interest of our stockholders. Certain of our principal stockholders may have conflicts of interests with our other stockholders or our company in the future. Certain of our principal stockholders, including Warburg Pincus, may make investments in companies and from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. These other investments may:  create competing financial demands on our principal stockholders;  create potential conflicts of interest; and  require efforts consistent with applicable law to keep the other businesses separate from our operations. These principal stockholders may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Furthermore, these principal stockholders may have an interest in us pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to our stockholders. In addition, these principal stockholders rights to vote or dispose of equity interests in us are not subject to restrictions in favor of us other than as may be required by applicable law. Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving our company that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 100 million shares of blank check preferred stock. Without stockholder approval, the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock. With these rights, preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors, whereby directors serve for three year terms, with approximately one third of the directors coming up for reelection each year. Having a staggered board makes it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest, which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of our company that is not favored by our board of directors. We are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under these provisions, if anyone becomes an interested stockholder, we may not enter into a business combination with that person for three years without special approval, which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control. For purposes of Section 203, interested stockholder means, generally, someone owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of our company that owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years, subject to certain exceptions as described in Section 203. Under one such exception, Warburg Pincus does not constitute an interested stockholder. 54 Table of Contents A large percentage of our outstanding common stock is held by insiders, and, as a result, the trading market for the common stock will not be as liquid as the stock of other public companies, and our common stock price could be volatile. We have approximately 105.2 million shares of common stock outstanding and approximately 34.6% of the shares are beneficially owned by directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and their respective affiliates. Companies with a substantial amount of stock held by insiders can be subject to a more volatile stock price. Fluctuations in the price of our common stock could be significant and will likely be impacted by a number of factors, such as:  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;  changes in our growth rate or our competitors growth rates;  strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;  our ability to develop, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;  loss of any of key management personnel;  disputes or other developments with respect to intellectual property rights;  product liability claims or other litigation;  public concern as to the safety or efficacy of our products;  the publics reaction to our press releases and other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;  sales of common stock by us, our significant stockholders, executive officers or directors;  changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally;  changes in expectations or future performance;  new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; and  changes in health care policy in the United States and internationally, including changes in the availability of third-party reimbursement. A significant decline in the price of our common stock could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation. We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and we currently intend to retain all of our earnings for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result, our stockholders will only receive a return on their investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
