Item 1A. Risk Factors In analyzing our company, you should consider carefully the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations”. If any of the risks described below occur, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected and the value of our common stock could decline. Risks Related to Our Business We will need to raise more cash in the future We have almost always had negative cash flows from operations. Our business will continue to result in a substantial requirement for research and development expenses for several years, during which we may not be able to bring in sufficient cash and/or revenues to offset these expenses. During 2012 and 2013, we expanded our commercialization activities while simultaneously pursuing available financing sources to support operations and growth. We have had, and we will continue to have, an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to continue funding our operations to profitability. We do not currently believe that our cash balance and the revenues from our operations will be sufficient to fund the development and marketing efforts required to reach profitability without raising additional capital from accessible sources of financing in the future. In addition, our Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank requires us to maintain certain minimum cash requirements, including at least three months of cash on hand, to avoid an event of default thereunder, and if our cash reserves fall below those minimum requirements, then we could be in default under the loan agreement and subject to potential adverse remedies by the lenders, which would have a substantial and material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock and warrants and our ability to raise capital. We believe our plans to raise additional cash from outside sources and if necessary, our cost containment efforts are sufficient to allow us to continue operations for the next twelve months. This includes minimum liquidity renuirements of the Loan and Security Agreement that require us to make principal and interest payments of $868,000 per month beginning in August 2014 and maintain at least three months of cash on hand to avoid an event of default under the loan agreement. Our plans include pursuing additional cash through strategic corporate partnerships and possibly engaging in future sales of equity, as well as our gross profits. While we have an established history of raising capital through these platforms, and we are currently involved in negotiations with multiple parties, there is no guarantee that adequate funds will be available when needed from additional debt or equity financing, development and commercialization partnerships, increased results of operations, or from other sources, or on terms acceptable to us. If our efforts to obtain sufficient additional funds are not successful. we would be required to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our research or product development, manufacturing operations, administrative operations. including our employee base, and clinical or regulatory activities which could negatively affect our ability to achieve certain corporate goals. Continued turmoil in the economy could harm our business Negative trends in the general economy, including trends resulting from an actual or perceived recession, tightening credit markets, increased cost of commodities, including oil, actual or threatened military action by the United States and threats of terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad, could cause a reduction of investment in and available funding for companies in certain industries, including ours and our customers. Our ability to raise capital has been and may in the future be adversely affected by downturns in current credit conditions, financial markets and the global economy. We have never been profitable on an operational basis and expect significant operating losses for the next few years We have incurred net operating losses in each year since we started business. As our focus on the Celution® System platform and development of therapeutic applications for its cellular output has increased, losses have resulted primarily from expenses associated with research and development activities and general and administrative expenses. While we work continuously to implement cost reduction measures where possible, we nonetheless expect to continue operating in a loss position on a consolidated basis and that recurring operating expenses will be at high levels for the next several years, in order to perform clinical trials, additional pre-clinical research, product development, and marketing. As a result of our historic losses, we have been, and are likely to continue to be, reliant on raising outside capital to fund our operations. 11 Table of Contents Our business strategy is high-risk We are focusing our resources and efforts primarily on development of the Celution® System family of products and the therapeutic applications of its cellular output, which requires extensive cash needs for research, development, and commercialization activities. This is a high-risk strategy because there is no assurance that our future products will ever become commercially viable (commercial risk), that we will prevent other companies from depriving us of market share and profit margins by selling products based on our inventions and developments (legal risk), that we will successfully manage a company in a new area of business (regenerative medicine) and on a different scale than we have operated in the past (operational risk), that we will be able to achieve the desired therapeutic results using stem and regenerative cells (scientific risk), or that our cash resources will be adequate to develop our products until we become profitable, if ever (financial risk). We are using our cash in one of the riskiest industries in the economy (strategic risk). This may make our stock an unsuitable investment for many investors. The development and manufacture of current and future generation Celution ® System devices is important to us We must continue to develop and manufacture both the current and future generation Celution® System devices. If we are not successful in further development of the current and future generation Celution® System devices, we may not be able to compete successfully in the marketplace (technology risk), and if we experience disruptions and/or delays in our production of these devices as required by the marketplace, our operations and commercialization efforts (clinical, regulatory and/or commercial sales) we would be harmed (manufacturing risk). Although we have significant experience in manufacturing the current Celution® System platform and its consumables at a commercial level, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and manufacture future generation Celution® Systems in a manner that is cost-effective or commercially viable, or that development and manufacturing capabilities might not take much longer than currently anticipated to be ready for the market. Although we have been manufacturing the Celution® 800 System and the StemSource® 900-based Cell Bank since 2008, we cannot assure that we will be able to manufacture sufficient numbers of such products to meet future demand, or that we will be able to overcome unforeseen manufacturing difficulties for this sophisticated equipment. We have a limited operating history; operating results and stock price can be volatile like many life science companies Our prospects must be evaluated in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by emerging companies and particularly by such companies in rapidly evolving and technologically advanced biotech and medical device fields. From time to time, we have tried to update our investors’ expectations as to our operating results by periodically announcing financial guidance. However, we have in the past been forced to revise or withdraw such guidance due to lack of visibility and predictability of product demand. Our stock price has a history of significant volatility, which may harm our ability to raise additional capital and may cause an investment in Cytori to be unsuitable for some investors. We may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls Our budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future revenues from sales as well our assessment of the future investments needed to expand our commercial organization and support research and development activities. We may be unable to reduce our expenditures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected events or a shortfall in revenue. Accordingly, a shortfall in demand for our products or other unexpected events could have an immediate and material impact on our business and financial condition. We are vulnerable to competition and technological change, and also to physicians’ inertia We compete with many domestic and foreign companies in developing our technology and products, including biotechnology, medical device, and pharmaceutical companies. Many current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing, and personnel resources. There is no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing alternative products that are more effective, easier to use, or more economical than those which we have developed or are in the process of developing, or that would render our products obsolete and non-competitive. In general, we may not be able to prevent others from developing and marketing competitive products similar to ours or which perform similar functions. Competitors may have greater experience in developing therapies or devices, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals, manufacturing and commercialization. It is possible that competitors may obtain patent protection, approval, or clearance from the FDA or achieve commercialization earlier than we can, any of which could have a substantial negative effect on our business. 12 Table of Contents We compete against cell-based therapies derived from alternate sources, such as bone marrow, umbilical cord blood and potentially embryos. Doctors historically are slow to adopt new technologies like ours, regardless of the perceived merits, when older technologies continue to be supported by established providers. Overcoming such inertia often requires very significant marketing expenditures or definitive product performance and/or pricing superiority. We expect physicians’ inertia and skepticism to also be a significant barrier as we attempt to gain market penetration with our future products. We believe we will continue to need to finance lengthy time-consuming clinical studies to provide evidence of the medical benefit of our products and resulting therapies in order to overcome this inertia and skepticism particularly in reconstructive surgery, cell preservation, the cardiovascular area and many other indications. Many potential applications of our technology are pre-commercialization, which subjects us to development and marketing risks We are in a relatively early stage of the path to commercialization with many of our products. We believe that our long-term viability and growth will depend in large part on our ability to develop commercial quality cell processing devices and useful procedure-specific consumables, and to establish the safety and efficacy of our therapies through clinical trials and studies. With our Celution® System platform, we are pursuing new approaches for therapies for cardiovascular disease, burns, soft tissue defects, reconstructive surgery, preservation of stem and regenerative cells for potential future use, and other conditions. There is no assurance that our development programs will be successfully completed or that required regulatory clearances or approvals will be obtained on a timely basis, if at all. There is no proven path for commercializing the Celution® System platform in a way to earn a durable profit commensurate with the medical benefit. Although we began to commercialize our reconstructive surgery products in Europe and certain Asian markets, and our cell banking products in Japan, Europe, and certain Asian markets in 2008, additional market opportunities for many of our products and/or services may not materialize for a number of years. Successful development and market acceptance of our products is subject to developmental risks, including failure of inventive imagination, ineffectiveness, lack of safety, unreliability, failure to receive necessary regulatory clearances or approvals, high commercial cost, preclusion or obsolescence resulting from third parties’ proprietary rights or superior or equivalent products, competition from copycat products, and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns. There is no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop and commercialize our products, or that our competitors will not develop competing technologies that are less expensive or superior. Failure to successfully develop and market our products would have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If any party to a key collaboration partnership fails to perform material obligations under our agreements, or any other collaboration agreement, or if such agreements are terminated for any reason, our business could significantly suffer We have entered into collaboration agreements under which we may receive future payments in the form of milestone payments, maintenance fees and royalties. We are dependent on our collaborators to commercialize our products in certain countries in order for us to realize any financial benefits from these collaborations. Our collaborators may not devote the attention and resources to such efforts to be successful. In addition, in the event that a party fails to perform under a key collaboration agreement, or if a key collaboration agreement is terminated, the reduction in anticipated revenues could delay or suspend our product commercialization in certain countries. Specifically, the termination of a key collaboration agreement by one of our collaborators could materially impact our ability to enter into additional collaboration agreements with new collaborators on favorable terms. If we or our collaborators fail to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to promotion, sale and manufacturing of approved products, regulatory agencies may take action against us or them, which could significantly harm our business Any approved products, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for these products, are subject to continual requirements and review by the FDA, state and foreign regulatory bodies. Regulatory authorities subject a marketed product, its manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities to continual review and periodic inspections. We, our collaborators and our respective contractors, suppliers and vendors, will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, including complying with regulations and laws regarding advertising, promotion and sales of products, required submissions of safety and other post-market information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP regulations (including requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation), and the requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping requirements. Regulatory agencies may change existing requirements or adopt new requirements or policies. We, our collaborators and our respective contractors, suppliers and vendors, may be slow to adapt or may not be able to adapt to these changes or new requirements. 13 Table of Contents Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in any of the following: • restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes; • warning letters; • withdrawal of the products from the market; • voluntary or mandatory recall; • fines; • suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals; • suspension or termination of any of our ongoing clinical trials; • refusal to permit the import or export of our products; • refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit; • product seizure; • injunctions; or • imposition of civil or criminal penalties. We must rely on the performance of Lorem Vascular for the commercialization of our products in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia. Lorem Vascular is the exclusive licensee for our products in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia, and while we will be strongly supportive to their efforts, they are responsible for obtaining regulatory approvals, market development and sales in these countries. Lorem Vascular is also a new company and as such will be required to develop the expertise, personnel and relationships in each of these countries required to successfully market and sell our products. We cannot guarantee that Lorem Vascular will make the investments required to be successful in these countries. We cannot guarantee that the necessary regulatory approvals can be obtained, and we cannot guarantee that our products will be successful in these markets even if advantageous market regulatory approvals are obtained. Market acceptance of new technology such as ours can be difficult to obtain New and emerging cell therapy and cell banking technologies, such as those provided by the Celution® System family of products, may have difficulty or encounter significant delays in obtaining market acceptance in some or all countries around the world due to the novelty of our cell therapy and cell banking technologies. Therefore, the market adoption of our cell therapy and cell banking technologies may be slow and lengthy with no assurances that significant market adoption will be successful. The lack of market adoption or reduced or minimal market adoption of our cell therapy and cell banking technologies may have a significant impact on our ability to successfully sell our product(s) into a country or region. Future clinical trial results may differ significantly from our expectations While we have proceeded incrementally with our clinical trials in an effort to gauge the risks of proceeding with larger and more expensive trials, such as in our PRECISE chronic ischemic trial in Europe, and our ATHENA I and ATHENA II feasibility trial in heart failure due to ischemic heart disease, we cannot guarantee that we will not experience negative results in larger and much more expensive clinical trials than we have conducted to date. Poor results in our clinical trials could result in substantial delays in commercialization, substantial negative effects on the perception of our products, and substantial additional costs. These risks are increased by our reliance on third parties in the performance of many of the clinical trial functions, including the clinical investigators, hospitals, and other third party service providers. Our product candidates may not receive regulatory approvals or their development may be delayed for a variety of reasons, including unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory requirements or safety concerns Clinical testing of our products is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and the failure or delay of a clinical trial can occur at any stage. Even if initial results of preclinical and nonclinical studies or clinical trial results are promising, we may obtain different results in subsequent trials or studies that fail to show the desired levels of safety and efficacy, or we may not obtain applicable regulatory approval for a variety of other reasons. Clinical trials for any of our products could be unsuccessful, which would delay or prohibit regulatory approval and commercialization of the product. In the United States and other jurisdictions, regulatory approval can be delayed, limited or not granted for many reasons, including, among others: 14 Table of Contents • clinical results may not meet prescribed endpoints for the studies or otherwise provide sufficient data to support the efficacy of our products; • clinical and nonclinical test results may reveal side effects, adverse events or unexpected safety issues associated with the use of our products; • regulatory review may not find a product safe or effective enough to merit either continued testing or final approval; • regulatory review may not find that the data from preclinical testing and clinical trials justifies approval; • regulatory authorities may require that we change our studies or conduct additional studies which may significantly delay or make continued pursuit of approval commercially unattractive; • a regulatory agency may reject our trial data or disagree with our interpretations of either clinical trial data or applicable regulations; • the cost of clinical trials required for product approval may be greater than what we originally anticipate, and we may decide to not pursue regulatory approval for such a product; • a regulatory agency may identify problems or other deficiencies in our existing manufacturing processes or facilities, or the existing processes or facilities of our collaborators, our contract manufacturers or our raw material suppliers; • a regulatory agency may change its formal or informal approval requirements and policies, act contrary to previous guidance, adopt new regulations or raise new issues or concerns late in the approval process; or • a product candidate may be approved only for indications that are narrow or under conditions that place the product at a competitive disadvantage, which may limit the sales and marketing activities for such products or otherwise adversely impact the commercial potential of a product. If a product is not approved in a timely fashion on commercially viable terms, or if development of any product is terminated due to difficulties or delays encountered in the regulatory approval process, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, and we will become more dependent on the development of other proprietary products and/or our ability to successfully acquire other products and technologies. There can be no assurances that any product will receive regulatory approval in a timely manner, or at all. Certain products will be marketed, and perhaps manufactured, in foreign countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals in foreign countries is subject to delay and failure for the reasons set forth above, as well as for reasons that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The approval process varies among countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Foreign regulatory agencies may not provide approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to protect our proprietary rights Our success depends in part on whether we can maintain our existing patents, obtain additional patents, maintain trade secret protection, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will be approved or that we will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable. There is also no assurance that any patents issued to us will not become the subject of a re-examination, will provide us with competitive advantages, will not be challenged by any third parties, or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of our products, or design around our patents. Our commercial success will also depend, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing on patents issued by others. If we were judicially determined to be infringing on any third-party patent, we could be required to pay damages, alter our products or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. If we are required in the future to obtain any licenses from third parties for some of our products, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to do so on commercially favorable terms, if at all. U.S. patent applications are not immediately made public, so we might be surprised by the grant to someone else of a patent on a technology we are actively using. Litigation, which would result in substantial costs to us and diversion of effort on our part, may be necessary to enforce or confirm the ownership of any patents issued or licensed to us, or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. If our competitors claim technology also claimed by us and prepare and file patent applications in the United States, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Any such litigation or interference proceeding, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time-consuming. 15 Table of Contents Successful challenges to our patents through oppositions, reexamination proceedings or interference proceedings could result in a loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we are unsuccessful in actions we bring against the patents of other parties and it is determined that we infringe the patents of third-parties, we may be subject to litigation, or otherwise prevented from commercializing potential products in the relevant jurisdiction, or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternative technologies, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, if such challenges to our patent rights are not resolved in our favor, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing certain products, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. On September 16, 2011, President Obama signed into law major patent law reform known as the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA). Among other things the AIA implements a first inventor to file standard for patent approval, changes the legal standards for patentability under section 102 of the statute, and creates a post grant review system. As a result of the added uncertainty of interpretation of the AIA and the uncertainty of patent law in general, we cannot predict with certainty how much protection, if any, will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court. Changes to the patent law under the AIA also may provoke third parties to assert claims against us or result in our intellectual property being narrowed in scope or declared to be invalid or unenforceable. Competitors or third parties may infringe our patents. We may be required to file patent infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or that the third party’s technology does not in fact infringe upon our patents. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related pending patent applications at risk of not issuing. Litigation may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries outside the U.S. where patent rights may be more difficult to enforce. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In addition, during the course of litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition to patents, which alone may not be able to protect the fundamentals of our business, we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. Some of our intended future cell-related therapeutic products may fit into this category. We rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our partners, employees, advisors, vendors, and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. There can be no guarantee that these agreements will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Failure to obtain or maintain patent protection, or protect trade secrets, for any reason (or third-party claims against our patents, trade secrets, or proprietary rights, or our involvement in disputes over our patents, trade secrets, or proprietary rights, including involvement in litigation), could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property in countries outside the United States Intellectual property law outside the United States is uncertain and in many countries is currently undergoing review and revisions. The laws of some countries do not protect our patent and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. This is particularly relevant to us as most of our current commercial product sales and clinical trials are outside of the United States. Third parties may attempt to oppose the issuance of patents to us in foreign countries by initiating opposition proceedings. Opposition proceedings against any of our patent filings in a foreign country could have an adverse effect on our corresponding patents that are issued or pending in the United States. It may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors’ patents that have been issued in countries other than the U.S. This could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We currently have pending patent applications in Europe, Australia, Japan, Canada, China, Korea, and Singapore, among others. 16 Table of Contents We and our medical devices are subject to FDA regulation As medical devices, the Celution® System family of products, and components of the Stemsource® cell banks, must receive regulatory clearances or approvals from the FDA and, in many instances, from non-U.S. and state governments prior to their sale. The Celution® System family of products is subject to stringent government regulation in the United States by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA regulates the design/development process, clinical testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, sale, distribution, and promotion of medical devices and drugs. Included among these regulations are pre-market clearance and pre-market approval requirements, design control requirements, and the Quality System Regulations/Good Manufacturing Practices. Other statutory and regulatory requirements govern, among other things, establishment registration and inspection, medical device listing, prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration, labeling and post-market reporting. The regulatory process can be lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. Before any new medical device may be introduced to the U.S. market, the manufacturer generally must obtain FDA clearance or approval through either the 510(k) pre-market notification process or the lengthier pre-market approval application, or PMA, process. It generally takes from three to 12 months from submission to obtain 510(k) pre-market clearance, although it may take longer. Approval of a PMA could take four or more years from the time the process is initiated. The 510(k) and PMA processes can be expensive, uncertain, and lengthy, and there is no guarantee of ultimate clearance or approval. Our Celution® products under development today and in the foreseeable future will be subject to the lengthier PMA process. Securing FDA clearances and approvals may require the submission of extensive clinical data and supporting information to the FDA, and there can be no guarantee of ultimate clearance or approval. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can result in application integrity proceedings, fines, recalls or seizures of products, injunctions, civil penalties, total or partial suspensions of production, withdrawals of existing product approvals or clearances, refusals to approve or clear new applications or notifications, and criminal prosecution. Medical devices are also subject to post-market reporting requirements for deaths or serious injuries when the device may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury, and for certain device malfunctions that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If safety or effectiveness problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA may take steps to prevent or limit further marketing of the product. Additionally, the FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing and promotion of devices for indications or uses that have not been cleared or approved by the FDA. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the necessary 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals to market and manufacture our other products in the United States for their intended use on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such clearances or approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. To sell in international markets, we will be subject to regulation in foreign countries In cooperation with our distribution partners, we intend to market our current and future products both domestically and in many foreign markets. A number of risks are inherent in international transactions. In order for us to market our products in Europe, Canada, Japan and certain other non-U.S. jurisdictions, we need to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals or clearances and must comply with extensive regulations regarding safety, manufacturing processes and quality. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearances to market, may differ from the FDA regulatory scheme. International sales also may be limited or disrupted by political instability, price controls, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs. Additionally, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold. There can be no assurance that we will obtain regulatory approvals or clearances in all of the countries where we intend to market our products, or that we will not incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or clearances, or that we will be able to successfully commercialize current or future products in various foreign markets. Delays in receipt of approvals or clearances to market our products in foreign countries, failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the future loss of previously received approvals or clearances could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Changing, new and/or emerging government regulations may adversely affect us Government regulations can change without notice. Given the fact that Cytori operates in various international markets, our access to such markets could change with little to no warning due to a change in government regulations that suddenly up-regulate our product(s) and create greater regulatory burden for our cell therapy and cell banking technology products. 17 Table of Contents Due to the fact that there are new and emerging cell therapy and cell banking regulations that have recently been drafted and/or implemented in various countries around the world, the application and subsequent implementation of these new and emerging regulations have little to no precedence. Therefore, the level of complexity and stringency is not known and may vary from country to country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process. Anticipated or unanticipated changes in the way or manner in which the FDA regulates products or classes/groups of products can delay, further burden, or alleviate regulatory pathways that were once available to other products. There are no guarantees that such changes in FDA’s approach to the regulatory process will not deleteriously affect some or all of our products or product applications. We may have difficulty obtaining health insurance reimbursement for our products New and emerging cell therapy and cell banking technologies, such as those provided by the Celution® System family of products, may have difficulty or encounter significant delays in obtaining health care reimbursement in some or all countries around the world due to the novelty of our cell therapy and cell banking technology and subsequent lack of existing reimbursement schemes/pathways. Therefore, the creation of new reimbursement pathways may be complex and lengthy with no assurances that such reimbursements will be successful. The lack of health insurance reimbursement or reduced or minimal reimbursement pricing may have a significant impact on our ability to successfully sell our cell therapy and cell banking technology product(s) into a county or region, which would negatively impact our operating results. Our concentration of sales in Japan may have negative effects on our business in the event of any crisis in that region We have operations in a number of regions around the world, including the United States, Japan, and Europe. Our global operations may be subject to risks that may limit our ability to operate our business. We sell our products globally, which exposes us to a number of risks that can arise from international trade transactions, local business practices and cultural considerations, including: • political unrest, terrorism and economic or financial instability; • unexpected changes and uncertainty in regulatory requirements and systems related; • nationalization programs that may be implemented by foreign governments; • import-export regulations; • difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables; • difficulties in ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions; • changes in labor practices, including wage inflation, labor unrest and unionization policies; • longer payment cycles by international customers; • currency exchange fluctuations; • disruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers, including electricity shortages; • difficulties in staffing foreign branches and subsidiaries and in managing an expatriate workforce, and differing employment practices and labor issues; • potentially adverse tax consequences; We also face risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings as a result of our foreign operations. We are also vulnerable to appreciation or depreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Although we have significant operations in Asia, a substantial portion of transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. As appreciation against the U.S. dollar increases, it will result in an increase in the cost of our business expenses abroad. Conversely, downward fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make our products less price competitive than local solutions. From time to time, we may engage in currency hedging activities, but such activities may not be able to limit the risks of currency fluctuations. Our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction in the amount of product ordered by any such customer. Our largest customer accounted for 26% of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2013. Loss of this significant customer or a significant reduction in the amount of product ordered by this customer could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. 18 Table of Contents We must maintain quality assurance certification and manufacturing approvals The manufacture of our products is, and the manufacture of any future cell-related therapeutic products would be, subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and distribution partners. The manufacture of devices and products for human use is subject to regulation and inspection from time to time by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, as well as equivalent requirements and inspections by state and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. There can be no guarantee that the FDA or other authorities will not, during the course of an inspection of existing or new facilities, identify what they consider to be deficiencies in our compliance with QSRs or other requirements and request, or seek remedial action. Failure to comply with such regulations or a potential delay in attaining compliance may adversely affect our manufacturing activities and could result in, among other things, injunctions, civil penalties, FDA refusal to grant pre-market approvals or clearances of future or pending product submissions, fines, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspensions of production, and criminal prosecution. There can be no assurance after such occurrences that we will be able to obtain additional necessary regulatory approvals or clearances on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals or clearances, or the loss of previously received approvals or clearances could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The termination or suspension of the BARDA contract could delay and/or adversely affect our business and our ability to further develop our Celution® System Cytori was awarded the contract with BARDA in September 2012 with the aim to develop a new countermeasure for a combined injury involving thermal burn and radiation exposure which would be useful following a mass-casualty event. The cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is valued at up to $106 million, with a guaranteed base period of approximately $4.7 million which includes preclinical research and the acceleration of Cytori’s ongoing development of Cytori’s ongoing development of the Celution® cell processing System (the Celution® System). Upon satisfactory proof of concept, BARDA may elect to exercise up to three contract options which will extend the contract term to up to five years if all options are exercised. BARDA may suspend or terminate this contract should we fail to achieve key objectives or milestones, or fail to comply with the operating procedures and processes approved by BARDA and its audit agency, the Defense Contract Audit Agency. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these milestones or continue to comply with these procedures and protocols, or whether we will be able to successfully develop our Celution® System under the contract. If the BARDA contract were terminated or suspended, our business could be adversely affected. The BARDA contract has certain contracting requirements that allow the U.S. Government to unilaterally control its contracts. If the U.S. Government suspends, cancels, or otherwise terminates our contract with them, we could experience significant revenue shortfalls, and our financial condition and business may be adversely affected Contracts with U.S. Government agencies typically contain termination provisions unfavorable to the other party, and are subject to audit and modification by the U.S. government at its sole discretion, which will subject us to additional risks. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally: · audit or object to our contract-related costs and fees, and require us to reimburse all such costs and fees; · suspend or prevent us for a set period of time from receiving new contracts or extending our existing contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations; · cancel, terminate or suspend our contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations; · terminate our contracts if in the Government’s best interest, including if funds become unavailable to the applicable governmental agency; · reduce the scope and value of our contracts; and · change certain terms and conditions in our contracts. BARDA is able to terminate its contracts with us, either for its best interests or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with or to achieve the milestones set forth in the contract schedules and terms. Termination-for-convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed and settlement expenses on the work completed prior to termination. Changes to, or an unexpected termination of this contract could result in significant revenue shortfalls. If revenue shortfalls occur and are not offset by corresponding reductions in expenses, our business could be adversely affected. We cannot anticipate if, when or to what extent BARDA might revise, alter or terminate its contract with us in the future. 19 Table of Contents Under our contract with BARDA, our operations, and those of our contractors, are subject to audit by the U.S. Government, a negative outcome to which could adversely affect our financial conditions and business operations U.S. government agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or the DCAA, routinely audit and investigate government contractors and recipients of federal grants. These agencies evaluate a contractor’s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The DHHS and the DCAA also review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a contract will not be reimbursed, while such costs already reimbursed must generally be repaid. If an audit identifies improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including, but not limited to: · termination of contracts; · forfeiture of profits; · suspension of payments; · fines; and · suspension or prohibition from conducting business with the United States government. We depend on a few key officers Our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and other key scientific and sales staff, including Christopher J. Calhoun, our Chief Executive Officer, and Marc Hedrick, MD, our President. We rely upon them for strategic business decisions and guidance. We believe that our future success in developing marketable products and achieving a competitive position will depend in large part upon whether we can attract and retain additional qualified management and scientific personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key scientific staff, or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel and develop expertise as needed could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may not have enough product liability insurance The testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of our regenerative cell products involve an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against us, our distribution partners, or licensees. There can be no guarantee that our clinical trial and commercial product liability insurance is adequate or will continue to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost, if at all. A product liability claim, product recall, or other claim, as well as any claims for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Also, well-publicized claims could cause our stock to fall sharply, even before the merits of the claims are decided by a court. Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock The market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders and subject us to litigation. The market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations. Among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this “Risk Factors” section and other factors, including: • fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of our competitors; • changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts; • variance in our financial performance from the expectations of securities analysts; • changes in the estimates of the future size and growth rate of our markets; • changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect our financial results; 20 Table of Contents • conditions and trends in the markets we serve; • changes in general economic, industry and market conditions; • success of competitive products and services; • changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors; • announcements of significant new products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors; • the timing and outcome of regulatory reviews and approvals of our products; • the commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company, our general industry or both; • changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt; • actual or expected sales of our common stock by the holders of our common stock; and • the trading volume of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general, the NASDAQ Global Market and the market for cell therapy development companies in particular may experience a loss of investor confidence. A loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business, our financial condition or results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities class-action litigation. Class-action litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources, which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations. Future sales of our common stock may depress our share price. As of December 31, 2013, we had 71,305,375 shares of our common stock outstanding. Sales of a number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the expectation of such sales, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, our 2004 Equity Incentive Plan provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance under the plan, which may, among other things, result in dilution of the price of our common stock. We may also sell additional common stock in subsequent public offerings, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have granted demand registration rights for the resale of certain shares of our common stock to each of Olympus Corporation, Astellas Pharma Inc. and Green Hospital Supply, Inc. pursuant to common stock purchase agreements previously entered into with each of these stockholders. An aggregate of 5,528,571 shares of our common stock are subject to these demand registration rights. If we receive a written request from any of these stockholders to file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering its shares of unregistered common stock, we are required to use reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC within 30 business days of such request a registration statement covering the resale of the shares for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. Our charter documents contain anti-takeover provisions Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions could also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our Board of Directors. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. These provisions: • authorize our Board of Directors to issue without stockholder approval up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors; • require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and cannot be taken by written consent; • establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our Board of Directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; and • limit who may call stockholder meetings. 21 We are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of the voting rights on our common stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time. We pay no dividends. We have never paid cash dividends in the past, and currently do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, our June 28, 2013 Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank currently prohibits our issuance of cash dividends. This could make an investment in our company inappropriate for some investors, and may serve to narrow our potential sources of additional capital. If securities and/or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, it is likely that in some future period our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline. Item 1B.
