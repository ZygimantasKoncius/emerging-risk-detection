Item 1A. Risk Factors We caution you that our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors listed below could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from projections in forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, in our other filings with the SEC, in our news releases and in public statements made orally by our representatives. A decline in general economic conditions could adversely affect our financial results. Consumer spending habits, including discretionary spending on dining at restaurants such as ours, are affected by many factors, including: •prevailing economic conditions;•energy costs, especially gasoline prices;•levels of employment;•salaries and wage rates;•consumer confidence; and•consumer perception of economic conditions.Weakness or uncertainty regarding the United States economy, as a result of reactions to consumer credit availability, increasing energy prices, inflation, increasing interest rates, unemployment, war, terrorist activity or other unforeseen events could adversely affect consumer spending habits, which may result in lower restaurant sales. Our financial condition depends on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to operate restaurants profitably, to generate positive cash flows and to generate acceptable returns on invested capital. The returns and profitability of our restaurants may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including those described below. Food service businesses are often adversely affected by changes in: •consumer tastes, including nutritional concerns;•consumer spending habits;•global, national, regional and local economic conditions; and•demographic trends.The performance of our individual restaurants may be adversely affected by factors such as: •traffic patterns;•demographic considerations; and•the type, number and location of competing restaurants.8Dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh produce and groceries subjects food service businesses to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients. In addition, the food service industry in general, and our results of operations and financial condition in particular, may be adversely affected by unfavorable trends or developments such as: •inflation;•increased food costs;•increased energy costs;•labor and employee benefits costs (including increases in minimum hourly wage, employment tax rates, health care costs and workers’ compensation costs);•regional weather conditions; and•the availability of experienced management and hourly employees.Operating results that are lower than our current estimates may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets and potentially close certain restaurants. The financial performance of our franchisees can negatively impact our business. As we are heavily franchised, our financial results are contingent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. We receive royalties, contributions to advertising and, in some cases, lease payments from our franchisees. We have established operational standards, guidelines and strategic plans for our franchisees; however, we have limited control over how our franchisees’ businesses are run. While we are responsible for ensuring the success of our entire chain of restaurants and for taking a longer term view with respect to system improvements, our franchisees have individual business strategies and objectives, which might conflict with our interests. Our franchisees may not be able to secure adequate financing to open or continue operating their Denny’s restaurants. If they incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt, it could result in financial distress or even bankruptcy. We anticipate that our franchisees will be impacted by the implementation of the health care reform legislation. If a significant number of franchisees become financially distressed, it could harm our operating results through reduced royalties and lease income. For 2013, our ten largest franchisees accounted for 32% of our franchise revenue. The balance of our franchise revenue is derived from the remaining 264 franchisees. Although the loss of revenues from the closure of any one franchised restaurant may not be material, such revenues generate margins that may exceed those generated by other restaurants or offset fixed costs which we continue to incur.We have guaranteed certain franchisee lease payments and loan payments in relation to the Pilot Flying J locations. These guarantees include up to $2.0 million of lease payments and $0.7 million in loan payments. To support domestic franchised growth, we have arranged a program that provides up to $100 million in loans to new and existing franchisees that open new restaurants in under-penetrated markets. We guarantee up to the lesser of $12 million or 12% of the total outstanding loans under the program. There were $1.5 million of loans outstanding under this program as of December 25, 2013. Additionally, during 2013, we arranged a program that provides up to $247.5 million in loans to franchisees related to our current remodel program. We guarantee up to 5% of the total outstanding loans under the program. There were no loans outstanding as of December 25, 2013. Under any of the programs, if franchisees are not able to fund required payments when due, we could be required to make payments up to the amounts guaranteed. Our growth strategy depends on our ability and that of our franchisees to open new restaurants. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants could adversely affect our planned growth. The development of new restaurants may be adversely affected by risks such as: •costs and availability of capital for the company and/or franchisees;•competition for restaurant sites;•inability to identify suitable franchisees;•negotiation of favorable purchase or lease terms for restaurant sites;•inability to obtain all required governmental approvals and permits;•delays in completion of construction;•challenge of identifying, recruiting and training qualified restaurant managers;•developed restaurants not achieving the expected revenue or cash flow; and•general economic conditions.9The locations where we have restaurants may cease to be attractive as demographic patterns change. The success of our owned and franchised restaurants is significantly influenced by location. Current locations may not continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. It is possible that the neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, potentially resulting in reduced sales at those locations.The restaurant business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business will be adversely affected. Each of our restaurants competes with a wide variety of restaurants ranging from national and regional restaurant chains to locally owned restaurants. We expect competition to continue to increase. The following are important aspects of competition: •restaurant location;•advantageous commercial real estate suitable for restaurants;•number and location of competing restaurants;•attractiveness and repair and maintenance of facilities;•food quality, new product development and value;•dietary trends, including nutritional content;•training, courtesy and hospitality standards;•availability of and quality of staff;•quality and speed of service; and•the effectiveness of marketing and advertising programs.Our reputation and business could be materially harmed as a result of the failure to protect the integrity and security of guest information or employees' personal data. We receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests and employees. Our use of this information is regulated at the federal and state levels, as well as by certain third-party contracts. If our security and information systems are compromised or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, operations, results of operations and financial condition, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance. Numerous government regulations impact our business, and our failure to comply with them could adversely affect our business. We and our franchisees are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things: •preparation, labeling, advertising and sale of food;•sanitation and safety;•land use, sign restrictions and environmental matters;•employee health care requirements, including the implementation and uncertain legal, regulatory and cost implications of the health care reform law;•payment card regulation and related industry rules;•the sale of alcoholic beverages; •hiring and employment practices, including minimum wage and tip credit laws and fair labor standards; and•Americans with Disabilities Act.The operation of our franchisee system is also subject to regulations enacted by a number of states and rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission. Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. If we or our franchisees fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we or our franchisees could be subjected to restaurant closure, fines, penalties and litigation, which may be costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the future enactment of additional legislation regulating the franchise relationship could adversely affect our operations. 10We began complying with The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act in 2014. Because of the breadth and complexity of this legislation and the phased-in nature of implementation, we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the law will have on us. However, we expect that our expenses related to employee health benefits will increase over the long term as a result of this legislation. Any such increases could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the legislation will require restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus. We do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with this provision of the law, but cannot anticipate the changes in guest behavior that could result from the implementation of this provision, which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations.We are also subject to federal, state and international laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Such laws impose registration and disclosure requirements on franchisors in the offer and sale of franchises, and may contain provisions that supersede the terms of franchise agreements, including limitations on the ability of franchisors to terminate franchises and alter franchise arrangements.Litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to complaints or litigation brought by former, current or prospective employees, customers, franchisees, vendors, landlords, shareholders or others. We assess contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual in our financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Because lawsuits are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. However, the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. A judgment that is not covered by insurance or that is significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend, and may divert management’s attention away from operations and hurt our performance. Further, adverse publicity resulting from claims may harm our business or that of our franchisees.Negative publicity generated by incidents at a few restaurants can adversely affect the operating results of our entire chain and the Denny’s brand. Food safety concerns, criminal activity, alleged discrimination or other operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants do not just impact that particular restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. Rather, our entire chain of restaurants may be at risk from the negative publicity generated by an incident at a single restaurant. The increasing use of social media platforms has increased the speed and scope of adverse publicity and could hinder our ability to quickly and effectively respond to such reports. This negative publicity can adversely affect the operating results of our entire chain and the Denny’s brand. If we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer. Our future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel. Our future performance will depend on our ability to attract, motivate and retain these and other key officers and key team members, particularly regional and area managers and restaurant general managers. Competition for these employees is intense. If our internal controls are ineffective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. We maintain a documented system of internal controls which is reviewed and tested by the company’s full time Internal Audit Department. The Internal Audit Department reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We believe we have a well-designed system to maintain adequate internal controls on the business; however, we cannot be certain that our controls will be adequate in the future or that adequate controls will be effective in preventing errors or fraud. Any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls could have an adverse effect on our operating results or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations.11As a holding company, Denny’s Corporation depends on upstream payments from its operating subsidiaries. Almost all our assets are owned, and all of our operating revenues are earned, by our subsidiaries, which are also the primary obligors for substantially all of the indebtedness, obligations and liabilities related to our business. Accordingly, our ability to repurchase shares of our Common Stock and to make any distributions to our shareholders depends on the performance of those subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to Denny’s Corporation. Their ability to make such distributions may be subject to contractual and other restrictions. Many factors, including those over which we have no control, affect the trading price of our stock. Factors such as reports on the economy or the price of commodities, as well as negative or positive announcements by competitors, regardless of whether the report directly relates to our business, could have an impact of the trading price of our stock. In addition to investor expectations about our prospects, trading activity in our stock can reflect the portfolio strategies and investment allocation changes of institutional holders, as well as non-operating initiatives such as our share repurchase program. Any failure to meet market expectations whether for same-store sales, restaurant unit growth, earnings per share or other metrics could cause our share price to decline.Our indebtedness could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. As of December 25, 2013, we had total indebtedness of $173.1 million, including capital leases. We continually monitor our cash flow and liquidity needs. Although we believe that our existing cash balances, funds from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be adequate to cover those needs, we could seek additional sources of funds, including incurring additional debt and selling selected assets, to maintain sufficient cash flow to fund our ongoing operating needs, pay interest and scheduled debt amortization and fund anticipated capital expenditures over the next twelve months. We have no material debt maturities scheduled until April 2018. If we are unable to satisfy or refinance our current debt as it comes due, we may default on our debt obligations. For additional information concerning our indebtedness see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources." Our debt instruments include restrictive covenants. These covenants may restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter a variety of transactions. A breach of these covenants could cause acceleration of a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness. The credit agreement governing our indebtedness contains various covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to: •incur additional indebtedness;•pay dividends, purchase shares of Common Stock or make distributions or certain other restricted payments;•make certain investments;•create dividend or other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries;•issue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;•guarantee indebtedness;•enter into transactions with stockholders or affiliates;•create liens;•sell assets and use the proceeds thereof;•engage in sale-leaseback transactions; and•enter into certain mergers and consolidations.These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger, acquisition or other corporate opportunities and to fund our operations. If we incur additional debt in the future, covenant limitations on our activities (and risks associated with such increased debt levels generally) could increase.Though we currently participate in a share repurchase program, there can be no assurance that we will repurchase our Common Stock pursuant to the plan. Our credit agreement contains additional restrictive covenants, including financial maintenance requirements. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as uncertainties related to the current economy, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply with these covenants.12Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our debt instruments, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them, if any, to secure the indebtedness. If the lenders under our current or future indebtedness accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, we cannot be sure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our outstanding indebtedness.
