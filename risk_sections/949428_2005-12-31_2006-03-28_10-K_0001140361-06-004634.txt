RISK FACTORS OF THE BUSINESS Investors in Clean Diesel Technologies should be mindful of the following risk factors relative to Clean Diesel Technologies' business: CDT HAS INCURRED LOSSES IN THE PAST AND EXPECTS TO INCUR LOSSES IN THE FUTURE. Prior to 2000, Clean Diesel Technologies was a development stage business and has incurred losses since inception totaling $34,841,000 (excluding the effect of non-cash preferred stock dividends). At the date of this report, Clean Diesel Technologies has cash resources estimated to be sufficient for its needs into the first quarter of 2007. CDT has had minimal revenues through December 31, 2005 and expects to continue to incur operating losses at least through 2006. There can be no assurance that CDT will achieve or sustain significant revenues or profitability in the future. See the text below under the captions "Liquidity and Sources of Capital" in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," elsewhere herein. 9 CDT FACES CONSTANT CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL STANDARDS BY WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE EVALUATED. CDT believes that, due to the constant focus on the environment and clean air standards throughout the world, a requirement in the future to adhere to new and more stringent regulations both domestically and abroad is possible as governmental agencies seek to improve standards required for certification of products intended to promote clean air. In the event CDT's products fail to meet these ever-changing standards, some or all of the products may become obsolete. FUTURE GROWTH OF CDT'S BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING EMISSIONS-RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND FURTHER TIGHTENING OF EMISSION STANDARDS WORLDWIDE. CDT expects that the future business growth will be driven, in part, by the enforcement of existing emissions-related environmental regulations and tightening of emissions standards worldwide. If such standards do not continue to become stricter or are loosened or are not enforced by governmental authorities, it could have a material adverse effect on business, operating results, financial condition and long-term prospects. THE POSSIBILITY OF NEW METAL STANDARDS, ,LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITS OR STRICTER REGULATION FOR HEALTH REASONS OF PLATINUM OR CERIUM EXISTS. New standards or environmental limits on the use of platinum and / or cerium metal by a governmental agency could adversely affect the ability of CDT to use its Platinum Plus FBC in some applications. In addition CARB will require "multimedia" analysis of the FBC. The EPA could require a "Tier III" test of the Platinum Plus FBC at any time to determine additional health effects of platinum or cerium which tests would likely involve costs beyond the current resources of Clean Diesel. CDT FACES COMPETITION AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES BY COMPETITORS. There is significant competition among companies that provide solutions for pollutant emissions from diesel engines. Several companies market products that compete directly with CDT's products. Other companies offer products that potential customers may consider to be acceptable alternatives to CDT's products and services. CDT faces direct competition from companies with far greater financial, technological, manufacturing and personnel resources, including Engelhard, Donaldson, Fleetguard, Octel, Rhodia, Bosch and Johnson Matthey. Newly developed products could be more effective and cost efficient than CDT's current or future products. Many of the current and potential future competitors have substantially more engineering, sales and marketing capabilities and broader product lines than CDT does. CDT also faces indirect competition in the form of alternative fuel consumption vehicles such as those using methanol, hydrogen, ethanol and electricity. CDT DEPENDS ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THE FAILURE TO PROTECT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE GROWTH AND SUCCESS. CDT relies on patent, trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and other agreements with employees, customers, partners and others to protect its intellectual property. However, some of the intellectual property is not covered by any patent or patent application, and, despite precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use the intellectual property without authorization. CDT does not know whether any patents will be issued from the pending or future patent applications or whether the scope of the issued patents is sufficiently broad to protect the technologies or processes. Moreover, patent applications and issued patents may be challenged or invalidated. CDT could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending patent infringement suits. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Some of the key patents, including the fundamental platinum additive patent, will expire during the period 2006-2008. However, CDT believes that other longer lived patents, including those for platinum additives in combination with after-treatment devices, will provide adequate protection of the proprietary technology, but there can be no assurances CDT will be successful in protecting the proprietary technology. As part of the confidentiality procedures, CDT generally has entered into nondisclosure agreements with employees, consultants and corporate partners and has attempted to control access to and distribution of the technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. CDT plans to continue these procedures. Despite these procedures, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and make unauthorized use of the technologies or independently develop similar technologies. The steps that have been taken and that may occur in the future might not prevent misappropriation of the solutions or technologies, particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect the proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. 10 There can be no assurance that CDT will be successful in protecting its proprietary rights. Any infringement on any of the intellectual rights could have an adverse effect on the ability to develop and sell successfully commercially competitive systems and components. IF THIRD PARTIES CLAIM THAT THE PRODUCTS INFRINGE UPON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, CDT MAY BE FORCED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT TIME LITIGATING SUCH CLAIMS AND THE OPERATING RESULTS COULD SUFFER. Third parties may claim that the products and systems infringe upon third-party patents and other intellectual property rights. Identifying third-party patent rights can be particularly difficult, especially since patent applications are not published until up to 18 months after their filing dates. In the event a competitor were to challenge the patents, or assert that the products or processes infringe its patent or other intellectual property rights, CDT could incur substantial litigation costs, be forced to make expensive product modifications, pay substantial damages, or even be forced to cease some operations. Third-party infringement claims, regardless of their outcome, would not only drain financial resources but also divert the time and effort of management and could result in customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products or services until resolution of the litigation. AN EXTENDED INTERRUPTION OF THE SUPPLY OR A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF PLATINUM COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON BUSINESS. The cost of platinum or the processing cost associated with converting the metal may have a direct impact on the future pricing and profitability of the Platinum Plus FBC. Although in the future, CDT intends to minimize this risk through various purchasing and hedging strategies, there can be no assurance that this will be successful. A shortage in the supply of platinum or a significant prolonged increase in the price of platinum, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition. FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON FUTURE SUCCESS. CDT's success will depend, in large part, on the ability to retain current key personnel, attract and retain additional qualified management, scientific, and manufacturing personnel, and develop and maintain relationships with research institutions and other outside consultants. The loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel, or the failure to assimilate effectively such personnel could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition. CDT'S RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE DUE TO CERTAIN REGULATORY, MARKETING AND COMPETITIVE FACTORS FROM WHICH CDT HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL OVER. The factors listed below, some of which CDT cannot control, may cause the revenues and results of operations to fluctuate significantly: - Actions taken by regulatory bodies relating to the verification or registration of the products. - The extent to which the Platinum Plus FBC and ARIS 2000 NOx reduction products obtain market acceptance. - The timing and size of customer purchases. - Customer concerns about the stability of the business which could cause them to seek alternatives to CDT's product. CDT IS CURRENTLY DEPENDENT ON A FEW MAJOR CUSTOMERS FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF REVENUES AND THE REVENUES COULD DECLINE IF CDT IS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN OR DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH CURRENT OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS. A few customers currently account for a significant portion of revenues. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, three customers accounted for approximately 43% of revenues. The majority of the revenues received from these three customers consisted of license fees and ARIS hardware purchases. CDT intends to establish long-term relationships with existing customers and continue to expand its customer base. While CDT diligently seeks to become less dependent on any single customer, it is likely that certain contractual relationships may result in one or more customers contributing to a significant portion of the revenue in any given year for the foreseeable future. The loss of one or more of these significant customers may result in a material adverse effect on revenues, the ability to become profitable or the ability to continue the business operations. 11 CDT DEPENDS ON THE MARKETABILITY OF THREE PRIMARY PRODUCTS - PLATINUM PLUS FBC, ARIS SYSTEMS AND CATALYZED WIRE MESH FILTERS. The Platinum Plus fuel borne catalyst, ARIS advanced reagent injection system for selective catalytic reduction and the catalyzed wire mesh filter are the three primary products of Clean Diesel. Failure of any of the products to achieve market acceptance may limit the company's growth potential. Clean Diesel may have to cease operations if all of the primary products fail to achieve market acceptance and/or fail to generate significant revenues. Additionally, the marketability of the products is dependent upon obtaining verifications from agencies such as the EPA, CARB, or similar European agencies as well as the effectiveness of the products in relation to various environmental regulations in the many jurisdictions in which Clean Diesel markets and sells its products. CDT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MARKET NEW PRODUCTS THAT ARE DEVELOPED AND OR OBTAIN DIRECT OR INDIRECT VERIFICATION OR APPROVALS OF THE NEW PRODUCTS. CDT plans to market other emissions reduction devices used in combination with the Platinum Plus fuel borne catalyst and ARIS injector. There are numerous development and verification issues that may preclude the introduction of these products into commercial sale. If CDT is unable to demonstrate the feasibility of these products or obtain verification or approval for the products from agencies such as the EPA, CARB or similar European agencies, CDT may have to abandon the products or alter the business plan. Such modifications to the business plan will likely delay achievement of milestones related to revenue increases and achievement of profitability. NO ASSURANCES OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING Clean Diesel Technologies may seek additional funding in the form of a private or public offering of additional shares of equity securities. Any such funding will depend on prior stockholder approval of an amendment to the Clean Diesel certificate of incorporation authorizing additional equity. Any offering of such securities would result in dilution to the stockholders of Clean Diesel Technologies. The ability of CDT to consummate financing will depend on the status of CDT's marketing programs and commercialization progress, as well as conditions then prevailing in the relevant capital markets. There can be no assurance that such funding will be available if needed, or on acceptable terms. In the event that CDT needs additional funds and is unable to raise such funds, CDT may be required to delay, scale back, or severely curtail its operations or otherwise impede its ongoing commercialization, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results, financial condition and long-term prospects. See the text below under the captions "Liquidity and Sources of Capital" in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," elsewhere herein. CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS COULD IMPACT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. The majority of recent activities have been in the U.S. However, CDT has increased its activities in Europe and Asia, and thus potential for currency exposure exists. CDT intends to manage the risk to such exposure, if any, by entering into foreign currency futures and options contracts. There can be no assurance that currency fluctuation will not have a significant effect on the operations in the future. CDT HAS NOT AND DOES NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON THE COMMON STOCK SHARES. CDT has not paid dividends on its common stock since inception, and does not intend to pay any dividends to the holders of common stock in the foreseeable future. CDT intends to reinvest earnings, if any, in the development and expansion of the business. THE PRICE OF THE COMMON STOCK SHARES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE SALE OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NEW SHARES. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of common stock, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants, or in the event that CDT elects to sell shares of common stock in the future to fund continuing operations, in the public market or a private placement, or the perception by the market that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could impair the ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or debt financing. The perceived risk of dilution may cause the existing stockholders and other holders to sell their shares of stock, which would contribute to a decrease in the stock price. In that regard, significant downward pressure on the trading price of CDT's common stock may also cause investors to engage in short sales, which would further contribute to significant downward pressure on the trading price of the stock. 12 CDT'S COMMON STOCK IS CURRENTLY TRADED ON THE OVER-THE COUNTER MARKET, THE ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT MARKET OF THE LONDON EXCHANGE AND THE FRANKFURT STOCK EXCHANGE AND AN INVESTOR'S ABILITY TO TRADE THE STOCK MAY BE LIMITED BY TRADING VOLUME AND PRICE VOLATILITY. The trading volume in CDT's common stock has been relatively limited. A consistently active trading market for its common stock may not continue on the OTC market or on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. The average daily trading volume in the common stock on the OTC market for the month ended January, 2006 was approximately 4,140 shares. The average daily trading volume in the common stock on Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange for the month ended January, 2006 was approximately 494 shares. In February 2006, clean Diesel began trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange in Germany. There has been significant volatility in the market prices of publicly traded shares of emerging growth technology companies, including CDT. Factors such as announcements of technical developments, verifications, establishment of distribution agreements, significant sales orders, changes in governmental regulation and developments in patent or proprietary rights may have a significant effect on the market price of CDT's common stock. In addition, there has been a low average daily trading volume of the common stock. To the extent this trading pattern continues, the price of the common stock may fluctuate significantly as a result of relatively minor changes in demand for such shares and sales of stock by holders.
