We provide software and engineering service offerings to the smart device marketplace. A smart device is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has the ability to display information, runs an operating system (e.g., Microsoft® Windows® CE 6.0) and may be connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection. Examples of smart devices that we target include set-top boxes, home gateways, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, personal digital assistants (PDAs), personal media players and smartphones. We primarily focus on smart devices that utilize embedded versions of the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems, specifically Windows CE, Windows XP Embedded and Windows Mobiletm. We have been providing software and engineering services to the smart device marketplace since our inception. Our customers include world class original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), silicon vendors, peripheral vendors, and enterprises that develop, market and distribute smart devices. The software and engineering services we provide our customers are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment. Until mid-2004, we were also in the business of manufacturing and distributing our own proprietary hardware device, called the Power Handheld, which was sold to telecommunication carriers. During the second quarter of 2004, we decided to discontinue this hardware business and end the manufacturing of the device. The hardware business segment is reported as a discontinued operation in our financial results. We were incorporated in the State of Washington in July 1994. Our principal office is located at 110 110th Avenue NE, Suite 200, Bellevue, Washington 98004, and our telephone number is (425) 519-5900. Industry Background The increasing need for connectivity among both business and consumer users is driving demand for easy-to-use, cost-effective and customizable methods of electronic communication. Although the personal computer (PC) has been the traditional means of electronically connecting suppliers, partners and customers, the benefits of smart devices have led to their rapid adoption as a new class of powerful technology. Smart devices are particularly attractive to businesses and consumers because they are often less expensive than desktop and laptop computers; have adaptable configurations, including size, weight and shape; and are able to support a variety of customized applications and user interfaces that can be designed for specific tasks. These devices also are typically compatible with existing business information systems. The smart device industry is characterized by a wide variety of hardware configurations and end-user applications, often designed to address a specific vertical market. To accommodate these diverse characteristics in a cost-effective manner, OEMs and ODMs require operating systems that can be integrated with a diverse set of smart devices and can support an expanding range of industry-specific functionality, content and applications. The Microsoft Windows family of embedded operating systems  specifically Windows CE, Windows Mobile and Windows XP Embedded  helps satisfy these requirements because it leverages the existing industry-wide base of Microsoft Windows developers and technology standards, can be customized to operate across a variety of smart devices and integrate with existing information systems, offers Internet connectivity, and reduces systems requirements compared to traditional PC operating systems. The smart device marketplace is being influenced by the following factors:  Growing demand by business professionals and high-end consumers for converged mobile devices that combine telephony, data (such as email and internet browsing), multimedia and location awareness is driving new sophisticated smart device designs by our OEM customers;  The ubiquity of cellular and WLAN wireless networks is driving rapid adoption of smart devices that leverage broadband and high-speed wireless data networks, including Internet Protocol (IP) set-top boxes, 4 Table of Contents voice-over-IP (VoIP) phones, residential gateways, and home networking solutions linking smart devices with PCs;  The baseline expectation for device functionality continues to grow. Users of smart devices expect to be able to access email and the Internet and synchronize their devices with corporate data sources. Microsoft operating systems are already well positioned to leverage this trend with built-in synchronization capabilities, access to Exchange email servers, and similar functionality;  Security is becoming an increasingly important concern as devices are able to access networks and store sensitive information locally such as email, spreadsheets and other documents. Users are demanding that these types of information be protected in the same ways they are protected on the desktop; and  Higher bandwidth networks coupled with the larger displays and increased processing power found on new devices means that more multi-media content will be available to devices  increasing demand for digital rights management, content management and related technologies. Software and Service Solutions for Smart Device Makers Our customers include world class OEMs and ODMs, device component suppliers such as silicon vendors and peripheral vendors and enterprises with customized device needs such as retailers and field service organizations. Representative customer relationships in 2006 included:  A large North American OEM continued to engage us to assist in the development and testing of mobile office phones;  Palm, Inc. continued to engage us to provide engineering services for its series of Windows Mobile Smartphone devices;  A silicon vendor engaged us to develop drivers for several of its silicon solutions and to include its components on our proprietary hardware reference designs;  A silicon vendor engaged us to assist in the development of a series of board support packages (BSPs) in support of various processors;  Several large Asian OEMs engaged us to assist in the development of new lines of Windows Mobile-based handheld devices;  A large North American silicon vendor engaged us to assist in developing several Windows Mobile BSPs in support of its new line of processors focused on the handset market; and  Over 75 OEMs and silicon vendors  including Symbol Technologies, Hewlett-Packard Company (HP), ASUStek Computer, Hand Held Products and Lite-On Technology Corporation  licensed our SDIO Now! technology in 2006 for integration into their smart devices. We offer a range of software products to our customers for the development and deployment of smart devices, including both those of third parties and our own proprietary software products, along with our engineering service offerings. Our goal is to increase the breadth and depth of our software and engineering service offerings to smart device customers to enhance our position as an overall solutions provider. Third-Party Software Products We have multiple license and distribution agreements with third-party software vendors. Our ability to resell these third-party software products, whether stand-alone or in conjunction with our own proprietary software and engineering service offerings, provides our customers with a significant source for their smart device project needs. Our third-party software offerings include the following:  We are a Microsoft authorized Value-Added Provider (VAP) of Windows Embedded operating systems (OS) and toolkits for Windows CE, Windows XP/NT Embedded, Windows XP Professional with Embedded Restrictions, Windows Server with Embedded Restrictions, Windows XP Embedded for Point of Sale and Microsoft Classic operating systems with Embedded restrictions, including DOS and Windows 98/2000/ 5 Table of Contents ME/NT. The majority of our software revenue in 2006 was earned through the resale of Microsoft Embedded operating systems; and  We sub-license and resell other third-party software such as the Esmertec Jeode Java Virtual Machine (JVM) under our JEM-CEtm brand name and Datalight Inc.s FlashFX and Reliance products. Proprietary Software Products Our proprietary software offerings include:  SDIO Hx  SDIO (Secure Digital Input Output) is an industry standard format that allows very small form-factor peripheral and memory cards to be used with smart devices. Our SDIO solutions have become the industry standard software development kit used by OEMs, ODMs and peripheral vendors who are creating SDIO solutions for smart devices running Microsoft Windows CE and Windows Mobile operating systems. There are currently over 100 licensees of our SDIO technology. In response to customer demand and the changing technology landscape affecting secure digital (SD) technology, we released SDIO Now! 2.2 in the first quarter of 2006. Differentiated from other competitive offerings, this product included features requested by licensees such as support for larger SD memory cards, increased performance and a cost-effective solution for adding any combination of two MultiMediaCards (MMC), SD cards or SDIO cards to converged devices. In the second quarter of 2006, we extended our SDIO product line with the introduction of our SDIO Hx architecture, which significantly increases the data throughput performance for handheld devices. OEMs can now economically add high performance Wi-Fi capabilities to smartphones and other embedded devices by using an internal SDIO Wi-Fi card while adding a second external expansion slot for high-density memory cards or other SDIO peripherals. The demand for this cost-effective high performance Wi-Fi/memory solution has made it a highly desirable feature on the next generation of handheld devices. Microsoft has incorporated our SDIO Now! v2.0 technology into its CE 5.0 and Windows Mobile 5.0 operating systems. While the SDIO Hx versions of software have functionality and performance enhancements not found in the SDIO Now! v2.0, there can be no assurance that the inclusion of the SDIO Now! v2.0 software in the base Microsoft operating system will not have a detrimental effect on sales of the SDIO Hx software in the future.  Media+ Portable Media Player  Media+ is a digital media-management and player software solution based on Microsoft® Windows® CE 5.0 that enables OEMs to quickly enter the growing market for PMP players, a new product category that enables consumers to enjoy movies and video clips, view family photos, and listen to music on a single mobile device.  Our DevkitIDP line of Marvell XScale® Technology-based development platforms accelerate time to market for OEMs building Windows CE 5.0, Windows CE 6.0 and Windows Mobile 5.0 embedded devices. We currently ship DevkitIDP 255, acquired from Vibren Technologies, Inc. (Vibren) in August 2005. The DevkitIDP 255 is based on the Marvel PXA255 Embedded Processor. In 2006, we launched the DevkitIDP 270 based on a new generation Marvell PXA270 embedded processor, as well as DevKitIDP 320 based on the new Marvell 320 PROCESSORS.. We intend on introducing additional development platforms in the future which may be based on other silicon vendors processor families. Our DevkitIDP products uniquely offer a wide variety of peripheral chips and multiple expansion slots, which provides developers valuable flexibility in the early stages of development when device functionality is being validated. The DevkitIDP product layout is optimized so developers can quickly access hardware test points which shortens debug time.  Our SchemaBSP tool, acquired from Vibren, reduces customer development efforts. SchemaBSP offers a revolutionary three-step process that, when used in conjunction with Microsoft Platform Builder, reduces Windows CE board bring up time by up to 40%. Once an BSP is created with SchemaBSP, the architecture of the tool enables code reuse across multiple product lines, easy BSP updates when new hardware features are added to a design, and quick migration to new OS versions of Windows CE.  Universal serial bus (USB) interfaces. 6 Table of Contents Software revenue for the last three fiscal years was as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Software revenue: Third-party software $ 30,317 $ 28,561 $ 25,663 BSQUARE proprietary software 2,617 2,649 2,701 Total software revenue $ 32,934 $ 31,210 $ 28,364 Software revenue as a percentage of total revenue 66 % 73 % 73 % Third-party software revenue as a percentage of total software revenue 92 % 92 % 90 % The resale of Microsoft Embedded operating systems and related products accounts for substantially all of our third-party software revenue. Engineering Service Offerings We provide Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile smart device makers with consulting and professional engineering services including:  Device solution strategy consulting;  Software and hardware design and development services;  Platform development systems integration;  Application, middleware and multimedia software development;  Quality assurance and testing services;  Hardware design, prototype and product development services;  Customer technical support; and  Platform development and quality assurance training. Customers utilize our engineering service offerings because our deep experience with Windows Embedded operating systems typically results in shorter development cycles and reduced time to market, lower overall costs to complete projects, and product robustness and features the customer may have been unable to achieve through other means. Revenue from professional engineering services for the last three fiscal years was as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Total service revenue $ 16,881 $ 11,713 $ 10,556 Service revenue as a percentage of total revenue 34 % 27 % 27 % Strategy Our strategy is to continue to enhance our position as a leading provider of smart device software. To advance this strategy, we intend to focus on the following areas:  Enhance our proprietary software product portfolio to generate additional revenue, particularly higher margin revenue, through which will have the added benefit of increasing opportunities to sell additional engineering services and third-party software products to our customers. During 2006, we increased our level of research and development in conjunction with the SDIO Hx version releases mentioned previously as well as through the development of our DevKitIDP references designs. We are continuing to execute and 7 Table of Contents evolve our product strategy and expect to continue to invest in new product development initiatives during 2007;  Provide our North American customers of Windows Embedded operating systems with additional product offerings as they become available from Microsoft. For example, in 2006, Microsoft made available to its authorized distributors the Window Embedded Point CE 6.0 operating system, which is targeted at the general device market;  Expand our engineering service offerings by adding new packaged engineering services, engineering capabilities, training and custom consulting offerings; for example, we were funded by Microsoft to develop the Windows CE 6.0 training curriculum and plan to deliver the first training course to customers early in 2007;  Leverage the significant number of customers gained through our resale of Microsoft Embedded operating systems by selling these customers additional software and service offerings. In each quarter, we typically sell Microsoft Embedded operating systems to over 400 unique customers. Today, more of these customers purchase service or software offerings other than the core Microsoft Embedded operating systems than in the past; and  Increase the percentage of sales derived from our international customers, particularly by focusing on growing sales in the Asia-Pacific region. A key element of our strategy is the expansion of our proprietary products that we license to our smart device customers. We believe that the continuing complexity and demands of device development will require our customers to seek out partners that are able to provide more complete device software solutions that can be quickly customized and brought to market. Relationship with Microsoft and Impact on our Smart Device Solutions Business We have a long-standing relationship with Microsoft and this relationship is critical to the continuing success of our business. Our credentials as a Microsoft partner include:  We are one of Microsofts largest distributors of embedded operating systems worldwide;  We are a Windows Embedded Gold-level Systems Integrator;  We were the Microsoft Systems Integrator of the Year for 2006;  We are a developer and provider of Microsoft Official Curriculum Training for Windows CE and Windows XP Embedded;  We are a leading systems integrator for Microsofts Windows Mobile for Smartphone and Pocket PC-based device development projects;  We are a Preferred Provider of Visual Tools to Microsoft;  We are a Gold-level member of Microsofts Third-Party Tools Provider Program;  We are an authorized Microsoft Windows CE for Automotive Solutions Integrator; and  We have been engaged by Microsoft on various service engagements. We work closely with Microsoft executives, developers, and product managers. We leverage these relationships in a variety of ways, including:  We gain early access to new Microsoft embedded software and other technologies;  We are able to leverage co-marketing resources from Microsoft, including market development funds, to support our own marketing and sales efforts;  We participate in Microsoft-sponsored trade shows, seminars, and other events;  We receive sales leads from Microsoft that enable us to sell our smart device software and service solutions; 8 Table of Contents  We receive certain rebates based upon certain predefined objectives and our Microsoft Embedded operating systems sales volume; and  We participate in Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile design reviews, enabling early access to product roadmap information wherein we provide important technical and customer feedback. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for more information regarding our relationship with Microsoft. Customers Customers of our smart device software and engineering service offerings include leading OEMs, ODMs, enterprises, silicon vendors and peripheral vendors seeking to leverage the benefits of Windows Embedded operating systems to develop high-quality, full-featured smart devices that meet the requirements of numerous end-markets. Representative customers include Digipos Systems Inc., Electronics for Imaging, Inc., Lockheed Martin, Micros Systems, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, PalmOne, Inc. and Solectron. Sales and Marketing We market our smart device software and engineering services to OEMs, ODMs, enterprises, silicon vendors and peripheral vendors predominantly through our direct sales force located in the United States, Taipei, Taiwan and Tokyo, Japan. We do not make significant use of resellers, channel partners, representative agents or other indirect channels. Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include direct marketing, advertising, event marketing, public relations, customer and strategic alliance partner co-marketing programs and a comprehensive website. We rely significantly on lead referral and other marketing support programs from strategic partners, particularly Microsoft. Research and Development Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development and release of our reference design and software products. Members of our research and development staff work closely with our sales and marketing departments, as well as with our customers and potential customers, to better understand market needs and requirements. We perform our research and development primarily utilizing our engineering staff located in Bellevue, Washington and Akron, Ohio. Competition The market for Windows-based embedded software and services is extremely competitive. We face competition from the following:  Our current and potential customers internal research and development departments, which may seek to develop their own proprietary products and solutions that compete with our proprietary software products and engineering services;  North American engineering service firms such as Intrinsyc, Vanteon and Teleca;  Off-shore development companies such as WiPro, particularly those focused on the North American marketplace  ODMs, particularly those in Taiwan who are adding software development capabilities to their offerings;  Contract manufacturers who are adding software development capabilities to their offerings; and  Microsoft Embedded operating system distributors such as Arrow and Avnet. Larger customers of Microsoft Embedded operating systems are typically knowledgeable of the competing distributors in the North American market and, consequently, will often put large orders out to bid amongst the distributors, which can create margin pressure and make it difficult to maintain long-term relationships with these customers. The gross profit 9 Table of Contents margin on sales of Microsoft Embedded Windows licenses is relatively low, historically about 14% on average. There can be no assurance that gross profit on future sales will not decline given these competitive pressures. As we develop new products, particularly products focused on specific industries, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed. It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share. Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us. Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced product and service revenue opportunities for us. The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Windows-based smart device software and services is low. In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded operating system products and services. These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Windows technology as we are. New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the Windows-based smart device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced. International Operations During 2006, our international operations consisted principally of subsidiaries and operations in Taipei, Taiwan and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Because our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft restricts our resale of Microsoft Embedded operating systems to North America, including Mexico, our foreign operations have traditionally focused on the sale of our own proprietary software products, particularly SDIO Now!, and engineering services. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we re-established a direct sales presence in Tokyo, Japan. We intend to continue to rebuild our ability to sell our products and services in Japan during 2007 and also plan on broadening our sales presence throughout the Asia-Pacific marketplace. We formalized and expanded our partnership with an engineering services firm in Hydrabad, India during 2006 although there are no commitments in terms of the utilization of those resources. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information regarding our international operations. Personnel As of December 31, 2006, we had 170 employees, including 109 employees in professional engineering services, 12 employees in research and product development, and 49 employees in sales, marketing and administrative services. Of these employees, 138 are located in the United States, 11 are located in Canada and 21 are located in Taiwan. In addition, from time to time, we employ temporary employees, consultants and contractors. As of December 31, 2006, we employed 41 contractors compared to 31 at December 31, 2005. The following highlights the number of employees by area: December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Professional Engineering Services 109 68 59 Research and Product Development 12 9 7 Sales, Marketing and Administrative 49 47 48 Total 170 124 114 As conditions necessitate, periodically professional engineering service employees will perform research and development engineering and visa versa. Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights Our intellectual property is critical to our success. In general, we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual arrangements. There can, however, be no assurance that our efforts will be effective to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, or to 10 Table of Contents prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with those developed by us. Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue relates to the resale of third-party software products, we are also reliant on our partners, particularly Microsoft, to appropriately protect their own intellectual property. We currently have a number of pending U.S. and international patent applications. We have 19 issued patents worldwide and a number of registered trademarks. We will continue to pursue appropriate protections for our intellectual property. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for more information regarding our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.

The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Microsoft-Related Risk Factors Due to the market that we serve and, in particular, our focus on devices utilizing Microsofts Embedded operating systems as well as the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the resale of Microsoft Embedded operating systems, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business. The following represent several Microsoft-related risk factors which may negatively impact our business and operating results. If we do not maintain our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft, our revenue would decrease and our business would be adversely affected. We have an OEM Distribution Agreement (ODA) with Microsoft, which enables us to resell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba) and Mexico. Software sales under this agreement constitute a significant portion of our revenue. If the ODA was terminated, our software revenue and resulting gross profit would decrease significantly and our operating results would be negative impacted. Moreover, if the ODA with Microsoft is renewed on less favorable terms, our revenue could decrease, our gross profit from these transactions, which is low relative to our gross profit from sales of our proprietary software products, could further decline and/or our operating expenses could increase. Microsoft offers us, and our competitors, largely volume-based rebates under the ODA and its related programs which have the effect of increasing our software gross profit. If Microsoft were to reduce, or eliminate, these rebate programs, which can contribute 2-3% of our total gross profit percentage from sales of Microsoft Embedded operating systems on a quarterly basis, our gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted. Microsoft informed us in the fourth quarter of 2006 that they are restructuring the rebate program beginning in the first quarter of 2007. We expect this restructuring to have a negative impact on our gross profit but are not yet able to quantify the impact. The ODA is renewable annually, and there is no automatic renewal provision in the agreement. The ODA was last renewed in October 2006 and will expire on June 30, 2007, unless terminated earlier under the provisions of the ODA. Microsoft has audited our records under our OEM Distribution Agreement in the past and will do so again in the future, and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and/or the termination of the ODA. There are provisions in the ODA that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for royalty auditing and other reasons. Non-compliance with these and other requirements could result in the termination of the ODA. We underwent an audit under the ODA with Microsoft covering a period of five years which concluded in the second quarter of 2004. Microsoft determined that we had correctly reported royalties during the audit period but that we could not account for all license inventory that we had received from Microsofts authorized replicators. While we disagreed with many of the audit findings, we ultimately chose to settle the dispute. Total settlement costs of $310,000 were recognized in the second quarter of 2004, which included audit costs of $140,000. In addition, we were notified during the fourth quarter of 2006 that Microsoft will be conducting another audit, which is currently scheduled to begin in March 2007. It is possible that future audits could result in additional charges. 14 Table of Contents If we do not maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft, we will have difficulty marketing and selling our software and services and may not receive developer releases of Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms. As a result, our revenue and operating results could suffer. We maintain a strategic marketing relationship with Microsoft. In the event that our relationship with Microsoft were to deteriorate, our efforts to market and sell our software and services to OEMs and others could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. Microsoft has significant influence over the development plans and buying decisions of OEMs and others utilizing Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms for smart devices and these targeted platforms are a significant focus for us. Microsoft provides customers referrals to us. Moreover, Microsoft controls the marketing campaigns related to its operating systems. Microsofts marketing activities, including trade shows, direct mail campaigns and print advertising, are important to the continued promotion and market acceptance of Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms and, consequently, to our sale of Windows-based embedded software and services. We must maintain a favorable relationship with Microsoft to continue to participate in joint marketing activities with them, which includes participating in partner pavilions at trade shows, listing our services on Microsofts website, and receiving customer referrals. In the event that we are unable to continue our joint marketing efforts with Microsoft, or fail to receive referrals from them, we would be required to devote significant additional resources and incur additional expenses to market software products and services directly to potential customers. In addition, we depend on Microsoft for developer releases of new versions of, and upgrades to, Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile software in order to facilitate timely development and delivery of our own software and services. If we are unable to maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft, our revenue could decline and/or our costs could increase thereby negatively impacting our operating results. Unexpected delays or announcement of delays by Microsoft of Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms product releases could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Unexpected delays or announcement of delays in Microsofts delivery schedule for new versions of its Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms could cause us to delay our product introductions or impede our ability to sell our products and services and/or to complete customer projects on a timely basis. These delays, or announcements of delays by Microsoft, could also cause our customers to delay or cancel their project development activities or product introductions, which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results. If Microsoft adds features to its Windows operating system or develops products that directly compete with products and services we provide, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted. As the developer of Windows, Windows XP Embedded, Windows CE and Windows Mobile, Microsoft could add features to its operating systems or could develop products that directly compete with the products and services we provide to our customers. The ability of our customers, or potential customers, to obtain products and services directly from Microsoft that compete with our products and services could negatively affect our revenue and operating results. Even if the standard features of future Microsoft operating system software were more limited than our offerings, a significant number of our customers, and potential customers, might elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing additional software from us or delay the purchase of our products and services while they perform a comparison of Microsofts competing offerings. Moreover, the resulting competitive pressures could lead to price reductions for our products and reduce our revenue and gross profit margin accordingly and our operating results could be adversely impacted. Microsoft has released Windows CE version 6.0 and version 5.0 of its Windows Mobile Smartphone and PocketPC operating systems which contain basic SDIO functionality and is therefore competitive with our SDIO Hx Now! and SDIO Hx product offerings. An agreement with Microsoft required us to deliver to Microsoft our SDIO Now! v.1.0 source code for inclusion into Windows CE 5.0 and Windows Mobile 5.0. Since that source code was delivered to Microsoft, we have continued to develop our SDIO Now! product line, introducing SDIO Now! v.2.0, v.2.2 and most recently SDIO Now! Hx, with new features and performance improvements that we believe are 15 Table of Contents important to customers. Additionally, we plan further enhancements to our SDIO Now! software product in 2007 and beyond. However, there can be no assurance that our next-generation SDIO Now! product offerings will continue to be competitive in the marketplace or that customers will not decide to use the basic functionality they receive from Microsoft as part of the operating system. Sales of SDIO Now! have traditionally represented the majority of our high-margin proprietary software revenue. If the market for Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms fails to develop further, develops more slowly than expected, or declines, our business and operating results may be materially harmed. Because a significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software products and engineering services targeted at the Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile platforms, if the market for these systems or platforms fails to develop further or develops more slowly than expected, or declines, our business and operating results could be negatively impacted. Market acceptance of Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile will depend on many factors, including:  Microsofts development and support of the Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile markets. As the developer and primary promoter of Windows CE, Windows XP Embedded and Windows Mobile, if Microsoft were to decide to discontinue or lessen its support of these operating systems and platforms, potential customers could select competing operating systems, which could reduce the demand for our Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile software products and engineering services which is our primary focus today;  The ability of the Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile software to compete against existing and emerging operating systems for the smart device market, including: VxWorks and pSOS from WindRiver Systems Inc.; Symbian and Palm OS from PalmSource, Inc.; JavaOS from Sun Microsystems, Inc.; and other proprietary operating systems. In particular, in the market for handheld devices, Windows Mobile faces intense competition from the Linux operating system. In the market for converged devices, Windows Mobile faces intense competition from the Symbian operating system. Windows Embedded operating systems and the Windows Mobile for Smartphone may be unsuccessful in capturing a significant share of these two segments of the smart device market, or in maintaining its market share therein;  The acceptance by OEMs and consumers of the mix of features and functions offered by Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms; and  The willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications that run on Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms. To the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to smart device users than those available on Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms, potential purchasers could select competing operating systems over Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms. General Business-Related Risk Factors Our marketplace is extremely competitive, which may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share. The market for Windows-based embedded software and services is extremely competitive. Increased competition may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margin and loss of customers and market share, which would harm our business. We face competition from:  Our current and potential customers internal research and development departments, which may seek to develop their own proprietary products and solutions that compete with our proprietary software products and engineering services;  North American engineering service firms such as Intrinsyc, Vanteon and Teleca; 16 Table of Contents  Off-shore development companies such as WiPro, particularly those focused on the North American marketplace;  ODMs, particularly those in Taiwan who are adding software development capabilities to their offerings;  Contract manufacturers who are adding software development capabilities to their offerings; and  Microsoft Embedded operating system distributors such as Arrow and Avnet. Larger customers of Microsoft Embedded operating systems are typically knowledgeable of the competing distributors in the North American market and, consequently, will often put large orders out to bid amongst the distributors, which can create margin pressure and make it difficult to maintain long-term relationships with these customers. The gross profit margin on sales of Microsoft Embedded Windows licenses is relatively low, historically about 14% on average. There can be no assurance that gross profit on future sales will not decline given these competitive pressures. As we develop new products, particularly products focused on specific industries, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed. It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share. Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us. Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced product and service revenue opportunities for us. The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Windows-based smart device software and services is low. In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded operating system products and services. These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Windows technology as we are. New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the Windows-based smart device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced. Our ability to maintain or grow the portion of our software revenue attributable to our own proprietary software products is contingent on our ability to bring to market competitive, unique offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs. If we are not successful in doing so, our business would be harmed. Proprietary software product sales provide us with much higher gross profit margins than we typically receive from third-party software products and our engineering service offerings as well as other advantages. Increasing the number and amount of proprietary products we sell is an important part of our growth strategy. Our ability to maintain and increase the revenue contribution from proprietary software products is contingent on our ability to enhance the features and functionality of our current proprietary products as well as to devise, develop and introduce new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and expand the number of proprietary products that we sell, and our failure to do so could negatively impact revenue and our operating results. We may experience delays in our efforts to develop new products and services, and these delays could cause us to miss market opportunities which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results. The market for Windows-based embedded software and services is very competitive. As a result, the life cycles of our products and services are difficult to estimate. To be successful, we believe we must continue to enhance our current offerings and provide new software product and service offerings with attractive features, prices and terms that appeal to our customers. We have experienced delays in enhancements and new product release dates in the past and may be unable to introduce enhancements or new products successfully or in a timely manner in the future. Our revenue and operating results may be negatively impacted if we delay releases of our products and product enhancements, or if we fail to accurately anticipate our customers needs or technical trends and are unable to introduce new products and service offerings into the market successfully. In addition, our customers may defer or forego purchases of our products if we, Microsoft, our competitors or major hardware, systems or software vendors introduce or announce new products. 17 Table of Contents If the market for smart devices develops more slowly than we expect, or declines, our revenue may not develop as anticipated, if at all, and our business would be harmed. The market for smart devices is still emerging and the potential size of this market and the timing of its development are not known. As a result, our profit potential is uncertain and our revenue may not develop as anticipated, if at all. We are dependent upon the broad acceptance by businesses and consumers of a wide variety of smart devices, which will depend on many factors, including:  The development of content and applications for smart devices;  The willingness of large numbers of businesses and consumers to use devices such as smartphones, PDAs and handheld industrial data collectors to perform functions historically carried out manually, or by traditional PCs, including inputting and sharing data, communicating among users and connecting to the Internet; and  The evolution of industry standards or the necessary infrastructure that facilitate the distribution of content over the Internet to these devices via wired and wireless telecommunications systems, satellite or cable. The success and profitability of our engineering service offerings are contingent on our ability to differentiate our offerings adequately in the marketplace, which is, in turn, contingent on our ability to retain our engineering personnel and defend our billing rate structure against those of our competitors, including those using lower-cost offshore resources. If we are unable to do so successfully, our business could be harmed. We are a leader in providing engineering services to smart device customers. Our market differentiation is created through several factors, including our experience with a variety of smart device platforms and applications. Our differentiation is contingent, in part, on our ability to attract and retain employees with this expertise, significantly all of whom are currently based in the United States. To the extent we are unable to retain critical engineering services talent and/or our competition is able to deliver the same services by using lower-cost offshore resources, our service revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted. The success and profitability of our service engagements are contingent upon our ability to scope and bid engagements and deliver our services profitably. If we are unable to do so, our service revenue service gross profit margin and operating results could be negatively impacted. Various factors may cause the total cost of service projects to exceed the original estimate provided to the customer or the contractual maximum in the case of fixed price contracts, including specification changes, customer deliverable delays, inadequate scoping and inefficient service delivery. If we are unable to adequately scope, bid and deliver on service engagements successfully, our service revenue, service gross profit and operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, depending on the cause of an overrun for a given customer, we may also decide to provide pricing concessions to that customer which could negatively impact our service revenue, service gross profit and operating results. We have entered into engineering service agreements in which we have agreed to perform our engineering service work at relatively low rates per hour in exchange for royalties, sometimes guaranteed, in the future. There is no guarantee that these arrangements will culminate as anticipated. We have entered into service contracts that involve reducing up-front engineering service fees in return for a per-device royalty as our customers ship their devices, and we may enter into more such agreements in the future. Many of these contracts call for guaranteed royalty payments by our customers. Because we are delaying revenue past the point where our services are performed, there is a risk that our customers may cancel their device projects or that their devices may not be successful in the market. In addition, these customers may not pay us all royalties owed, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results. 18 Table of Contents Cooperation and support from silicon vendors is critical for the success of our hardware reference designs. Such cooperation cannot be assured. We have been developing hardware reference designs based on the Marvell PXA Xscale architecture and plan to develop reference designs based on other silicon architectures. It is important that the silicon on which we base our reference designs receive continued support in the marketplace by the silicon vendors. For example, during the development of our designs, Intel made a strategic decision to sell its PXA Xscale division to Marvell which negatively impacted the sale of our Xscale-based reference designs. There can be no assurance that Marvell will continue to pursue and support the markets that we have been targeting with our reference designs. Cooperation and support from silicon vendors is critical to the success of our reference designs, and should silicon vendors not support our efforts, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted. The long sales cycle of our products and services makes our revenue susceptible to fluctuations. Our sales cycle is typically three to nine months because the expense and complexity of the software and engineering service offerings we sell generally require a lengthy customer approval process and may be subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:  Customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance review procedures;  The timing of budget cycles; and  The timing of customers competitive evaluation processes. In addition, to successfully sell software and engineering service offerings, we must frequently educate our potential customers about the full benefits of these software and services, which can require significant time. If our sales cycle further lengthens unexpectedly, it could adversely affect the timing of our revenue which could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. Erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business. Our business could be adversely affected should the financial condition of our customers erode, given that such erosion could reduce demand from those customers for our software and engineering services, could cause them to terminate their relationships with us, and/or could increase the credit risk of those customers. If the global information technology market weakens, the likelihood of the erosion of the financial condition of our customers increases, which could adversely affect the demand for our software and services. Additionally, while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, those allowances may not cover actual losses, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs. Our license, warranty and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims. It is possible, however, that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date, the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future. In addition, to the extent we develop and sell increasingly comprehensive, customized turnkey solutions for our customers, we may be increasingly subject to risks of product liability claims. There is a risk that any such claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside, the scope of our insurance coverage, and we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. A product liability claim brought against us, whether successful or not, could harm our business and operating results. Past acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate, and future acquisitions, if any, could disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and adversely affect our operating results. We have acquired the technologies, assets and/or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services and technologies in the future as part of our growth strategy. As an example, on June 30, 2005, we acquired certain assets of Vibren Technologies, Inc. for $500,000 in cash and the 19 Table of Contents assumption of certain liabilities and obligations. If we fail to properly evaluate, integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed. In some cases, we have implemented reductions in workforce and office closures in connection with an acquisition, which has resulted in significant costs to us. To successfully complete an acquisition, we must properly evaluate the technology, accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses, integrate and retain personnel, combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products and research and development, sales, marketing and support operations. If we fail to do any of these, we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners. Additionally, management may be distracted from day-to-day operations. We also may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which are especially critical in light of the Sarbanes-Oxley and other corporate governance requirements, and significant demands may be placed on our management and our operations, information services and financial, legal and marketing resources. Finally, acquired businesses sometimes result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which could be significant. Intellectual Property-Related Risk Factors Our software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages. It is difficult to determine whether our products and engineering services infringe third-party intellectual property rights, particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap and where there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed. If we were to discover that one of our products or service offerings, or a product based on one of our reference designs, violated a third-partys proprietary rights, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to continue offering that product or service. Similarly, third parties may claim that our current or future products and services infringe their proprietary rights, regardless of whether such claims have merit. Any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results. In certain cases, we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third-party technology incorporated into our products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others. However, any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount. Even if we receive broad third-party indemnification, these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement. In addition, in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our products or services. There can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims related to the products and services we provide, or arising from the incorporation by us of third-party technology, and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated, with companies with substantially greater resources than we have, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows, and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays. Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful in resolving a patent or other intellectual property infringement action claim against us, we may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain of our technologies and products, or delivering services based on the infringing technology, unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms, or at all. If such license is not obtained, we would be required to cease these related business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and operating results. 20 Table of Contents If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue and increase our costs. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position could be weakened and our revenue adversely affected. We rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property. These laws and procedures provide only limited protection. We have applied for a number of patents relating to our engineering work although we do not rely on patents as our primary defensive measure in protecting our intellectual property. These patents, both issued and pending, may not provide sufficiently broad protection, or they may not prove to be enforceable, against alleged infringers. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patents will be granted. Even if granted, these patents may be circumvented or challenged and, if challenged, may be invalidated. Any patents obtained may provide limited or no competitive advantage to us. It is also possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some, or all, of our products and services. If that occurred, we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents. The patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us at all or on acceptable terms. Similarly, it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent. In general, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws will be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us. We frequently license the source code of our products and the source code results of our services to customers. There can be no assurance that customers with access to our source code will comply with the license terms or that we will discover any violations of the license terms or, in the event of discovery of violations, that we will be able to successfully enforce the license terms and/or recover the economic value lost from such violations. To license some of our software products, we rely in part on shrinkwrap and clickwrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. As with other software, our products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult. A significant portion of our marks include the word BSQUARE or the preface b. Other companies use forms of BSQUARE or the preface b in their marks alone, or in combination with other words, and we cannot prevent all such third-party uses. We license certain trademark rights to third parties. Such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights and may take actions that would harm our business. The computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation, which is often complex and expensive, and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity. Litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results. Our software or hardware products or the third-party hardware or software integrated with our products may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services. Software and hardware components as complex as those needed for smart devices frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. We have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and, in some cases, have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products. Some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work. To the extent that we repair or replace products our expenses may increase. In addition, it is possible that by the time defects are fixed, the market opportunity may decline which may result in lost revenue. Moreover, to the extent that we provide increasingly comprehensive products and services, particularly those focused on hardware, and rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products, we will be dependent on the ability of third-party manufacturers to correct, identify and prevent manufacturing errors. Errors that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results. 21 Table of Contents If we are unable to license key software from third parties, our business could be harmed. We sometimes integrate third-party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third-party software offerings on a standalone basis (e.g. embedded operating systems under our ODA with Microsoft). If our relationships with these third-party software vendors were to deteriorate, or be eliminated in their entirety, we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In the event that we are unable to obtain these third-party software offerings, we would be required to develop this technology internally, assuming it was economically or technically feasible, or seek similar software offerings from other third parties assuming there were competing offerings in the marketplace, which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products, or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results. Governace and Contract-Related Risk Factors It might be difficult for a third-party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Washington law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors has the authority under our amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock. As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult. In addition, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes. The directors in each class serve for three-year terms, one class being elected each year by our shareholders. This system of electing and removing directors may discourage a third-party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors. In addition, Chapter 19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined acquiring person for a period of five years after the acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporations Board of Directors prior to the time of acquisition. This provision may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company. The existence of these anti-takeover provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. We will incur substantial costs to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act) introduced new requirements regarding corporate governance and financial reporting. Among the many requirements is the requirement under Section 404 of the Act for management to annually assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and for our registered public accountant to attest to this report. The SEC has modified the effective date and adoption requirements of Section 404 implementation for non-accelerated filers, such as us, such that we are first required to issue our management report on internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2007. We will be required to dedicate significant time and resources during fiscal 2007 to ensure compliance. The costs to comply with these requirements will likely be significant and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to comply with Section 404. Failure to do so could result in penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements, which could affect the ability of our auditors to issue an unqualified report (currently required by December 31, 2008) which, in turn, may further adversely affect our business and operating results. Non-compliance with our lease agreement could have a material adverse impact on our financial position. If we default under our corporate headquarters lease, the landlord has the ability to demand cash payments forgiven in 2004 under the former headquarters lease. The amount of the forgiven payments for which the landlord has the ability to demand repayment, in the event of default, decreases on a straight-line basis over the length of our 22 Table of Contents ten-year headquarters lease. The total amount of cash payments forgiven for which the landlord has the ability to demand repayment was $1.8 million at December 31, 2006. Any breach of or non-compliance with these lease agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business. Decreased effectiveness of equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees, and required changes in accounting for equity compensation could adversely affect earnings. We have historically used stock options and other forms of equity-related compensation as key components of our overall employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our shareholders, encourage employee retention, and provide competitive compensation packages. Applicable stock exchange listing standards relating to obtaining shareholder approval of equity compensation plans could make it more difficult or expensive for us to grant options or new forms of equity instruments to employees in the future. As a result, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. International Operations-Related Risk Factors Our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property, management, collections, regulatory and other risks. Customers outside of North America generated approximately 5% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. We currently have international operations in Taipei, Taiwan; Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; and Tokyo, Japan. Our international activities and operations expose us to a number of risks, including the following:  Greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property due to less stringent foreign intellectual property laws and enforcement policies;  Longer collection cycles than we typically experience in the North America;  Unfavorable changes in regulatory practices and tariffs;  Complex and/or adverse tax laws and/or changes thereto. Additionally, we may be subject to income, withholding and other taxes for which we may realize no current benefit despite the existence of significant net operating losses and tax credits in the U.S.;  Loss or reduction of withholding tax exemptions;  The impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies; and  General economic and political conditions in international markets which may differ from those in the U.S. These risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices, as well as on our future international revenue, which could harm our business and operating results. As we increase the amount of software development conducted in non-U.S. locations, potential delays and quality issues may impact our ability to timely deliver our software and services, potentially impacting our revenue and profitability. We conduct development activities in non-U.S. locations, primarily India, through a partnership with a local company, and Taiwan, to take advantage of the high-quality, low-cost software development resources found in these countries. Additionally, we have plans to increase development activity in both our Taiwan operation and other non-U.S. locations as engineering demands necessitate the hiring of additional engineering personnel. To date, we have limited experience in managing large scale software development done in non-U.S. locations. Moving portions of our software development to these locations inherently increases the complexity of managing these programs and may result in delays in introducing new products to market, or delays in completing service projects for our customers, which in turn may adversely impact the revenue we recognize from related products and services and could also adversely impact the profitability of service engagements employing offshore resources. 23 Table of Contents As our customers seek more cost-effective locations to develop and manufacture their smart devices, particularly overseas locations, our ability to continue to sell these customers our products and services could be limited, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results. Due to competitive and other pressures, some of our customers have and others may seek to move the development and manufacturing of their smart devices to overseas locations which may limit our ability to sell these customers our products and services. As an example, under our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft, we are only able to resell Microsoft Embedded operating systems largely in North America. If our customers, or potential customers, move their manufacturing overseas we may be restricted from reselling these customers Microsoft Embedded operating systems, or our other products and services, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
