ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Investment in us presents risks. If any of the risk events described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Some statements in the following risk factors discussion, constitute "forward-looking statements." Please refer to the section above entitled "Forward-Looking Statements." Our properties depend upon the Chicago metropolitan area economy and its demand for office space. With the exception of our joint venture interest in a building in Phoenix, Arizona, all of our properties are located in the Chicago metropolitan area, which exposes us to greater economic risks than if we owned properties in several geographic regions. Moreover, because our portfolio of properties consists primarily of office buildings, a decrease in the demand for office space may have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio. We are susceptible to adverse developments in the Chicago metropolitan area, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics, increased telecommuting, terrorist targeting of high-rise structures, infrastructure quality, increases in real estate and other taxes, costs of complying with government regulations or increased regulation and other factors. We are also subject to adverse developments in the national and Chicago regional office space markets, such as oversupply of or reduced demand for office space. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in the Chicago metropolitan area, or any decrease in demand for office space, including those resulting from Chicagos or Illinois regulatory environment, business climate or fiscal problems, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations. We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire. As of December 31, 2005, leases representing 4.0% of the annual base rent we receive for the properties in our portfolio will expire in 2006. Above market rental rates at some of our properties may force us to renew or re-lease some expiring leases at lower rates. There can be no assurance that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re-leased at net effective rental rates equal to or above their current net effective rental rates. If the rental rates for our properties decrease, our existing tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re-lease a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to holders of Series B Shares and our common shareholder would be adversely affected. Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and with the real estate industry. Our ability to pay distributions to holders of Series B Shares and our common shareholder depends on our ability to generate revenues in excess of expenses, scheduled principal payments on debt and capital expenditure requirements. Events and conditions generally applicable to owners and operators of real property that are beyond our control may decrease cash available for distribution and the value of our properties. These events include:  local oversupply, increased competition or reduction in demand for office space; 12  inability to collect rent from tenants;  vacancies or our inability to rent space on favorable terms;  increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes, due to inflation and other factors which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents;  costs of complying with changes in governmental regulations;  the relative illiquidity of real estate investments; and  changing submarket demographics. In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to holders of Series B Shares and our common shareholder. We face significant competition, which may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. There are a number of office real estate companies that compete with us in seeking prospective tenants. All of our properties are located in developed areas where there are generally other properties of the same type and quality. Competition from other office properties may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and maintain or increase rental rates, particularly in light of the higher vacancy rates of many competing properties which may result in lower-priced space being available in such properties. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, some of which are significantly above current market rates, we may lose potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when their leases expire. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and pay distributions to holders of Series B Shares and our common shareholder may be adversely affected. Our debt level reduces cash available for operations, capital expenditures and distributions to our holders of our Series B Shares and our common shareholder, and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations. As of December 31, 2005, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $453.0 million. Payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate our properties, fund necessary capital expenditures or to pay the distributions necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. Our relatively high level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our loan agreements could have significant adverse consequences to us, including the following:  our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;  we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms; 13  we may be unable to refinance our existing or future indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our existing indebtedness;  because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, increases in interest rates could increase our interest expense;  we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms;  we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases;  we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan agreements, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations; and  our default under any one of our mortgage loans with cross default provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness. If any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to holders of our Series B Shares and our common shareholder could be adversely affected. In addition, foreclosures could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, a circumstance which could hinder our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Code. Covenants in our debt instruments could adversely affect our financial condition and restrict our range of operating activities. The loan documents evidencing our loans contain certain covenants with our lenders, which include minimum ratios for debt service coverage, minimum net worth levels and numerous other financial covenants affecting us and certain of our properties. These covenants could limit our flexibility in conducting our operations and create the risk of a default on our indebtedness if we cannot continue to satisfy them. In addition, these covenants could limit our ability, without the prior consent of the appropriate lender, to further mortgage our properties. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants and are not able to get a waiver from the relevant lender, we will be in default under the relevant loan and any other loans which may be cross-defaulted with such loan. If this occurs, the relevant lenders may foreclose on our properties that secure the loans, pursue us or our affiliates for any portion of the debt which is recourse and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to holders of Series B Shares and our common shareholder. The average daily trading volume of our Series B Shares is relatively small, thus making it difficult to buy or sell significant numbers of shares without affecting the market price. Our common shares are not publicly traded, and our Series B Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). However, based on the recent historical average daily trading volume of our Series B Shares, the acquisition or sale of a significant number of our Series B Shares on the NYSE will in most cases affect the market price of the Series B Shares, thus making it difficult or impossible to buy or sell large numbers of shares at or near the market price in effect immediately prior to any such purchase or sale. In addition, because the purchase or sale of relatively small numbers of shares may significantly impact the price of the Series B 14 Shares, significant fluctuations in trading volume and price variations may occur, which may be unrelated to our operating performance. The Lightstone Group controls us, and will continue to control us, as long as one or more of its affiliates own a majority of our common shares. The Lightstone Group, through its subsidiary, Prime Office, beneficially owns all of our outstanding common shares. Our Board currently consists of seven trustees, of which three qualify as "independent" under NYSE rules. As long as The Lightstone Group beneficially owns a majority of our outstanding common shares, The Lightstone Group will continue to be able to elect all of the members of our Board. As a result, The Lightstone Group will control all matters affecting us, including (i) the composition of our Board and, through it, any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers, (ii) any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations, (iii) our acquisition or disposition of assets, (iv) our corporate finance activities and (v) the payment of distributions on our common shares and Series B Shares. The Lightstone Group and its designees on our Board may have interests that conflict with our interests. The Lightstone Group and its designees on our Board may have interests that conflict with, or are different from, our own and/or holders of our Series B Shares. Conflicts of interest between The Lightstone Group and us may arise, and such conflicts of interest may not be resolved in a manner favorable to us and/or holders of Series B Shares, including potential competitive business activities, corporate opportunities, indemnity arrangements, registration rights, dividends on our common shares and Series B Shares and the exercise by The Lightstone Group of its ability to control our management and affairs. Our organizational documents do not contain any provisions designed to facilitate resolution of actual or potential conflicts of interests, or to ensure that potential business opportunities that may become available to both The Lightstone Group and us will be reserved for or made available to us. Pertinent provisions of law will govern any such matters if they arise. We may sell or acquire additional assets which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. We may sell or acquire real estate or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe a sale or acquisition is consistent with our business strategies. However, we may not be successful in completing a desired sale or acquisition in a timely manner or pursuant to terms that are favorable to us. Real estate investments may be, depending on market conditions, relatively difficult to buy and sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. If we do complete an acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing any newly acquired properties at rental rates or upon other terms sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition and operations. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert managements attention from other important matters. We may also abandon acquisition or sale opportunities prior to completion and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have thus devoted significant amounts of management time to a matter not consummated. Furthermore, future acquisitions may expose us to significant additional liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. If and when we do complete a sale, we may not succeed in selling it for a price or on other terms favorable to us. 15 The redevelopment of certain of our existing properties and any future development we may undertake could be costly and involve substantial risk. As part of our operating strategy, (i) we may redevelop certain of our existing properties to upgrade the quality of an asset and/or change its use and (ii) we may acquire land for development or construct improvements on land we currently own. Developing and redeveloping real estate contains numerous risks, which may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to holders of our Series B Shares and our common shareholder. These risks include the risks that (i) financing and/or equity for development and redevelopment projects may not be available on favorable terms, (ii) long-term financing to refinance any short-term construction financing may not be available upon the completion of a project, (iii) the failure to complete construction of a project on schedule or within budget may increase debt service expenses and construction costs, and (iv) we may be unable to find interested users to acquire or lease space in a project after its completion, thus making it difficult or impossible for us to recoup our investment or refinance our indebtedness on the project. We may also abandon redevelopment or development projects prior to the commencement or completion or construction and (a) consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and (b) have thus devoted significant amounts of management time to a project which was not completed. Only our Series B Shares are listed on the NYSE and, therefore, we are entitled to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Only our Series B Shares are listed on the NYSE. Under the NYSE rules, a company which only lists preferred shares or debt is not required to comply with certain of the NYSE corporate governance requirements, including (1) the requirement that a majority of the board of directors of a listed company consist of independent directors, (2) the requirement that a listed company have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities and (3) the requirement that a listed company have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities. We are currently utilizing these exemptions as they relate to our Board. As a result, we do not have a majority of independent trustees, nor do we have nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees. Accordingly, the holders of Series B Shares and our common shareholder may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements. We depend on significant tenants. As of December 31, 2005, the five largest tenants in our portfolio represented approximately 37.4% of the total annualized rent generated by our properties (including joint ventures). Our tenants may experience a downturn in their businesses, which may weaken their financial condition, result in their failure to make timely rental payments or result in their default under their leases. In the event of any tenant default, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs attempting to protect our investment. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant also may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. If any tenant becomes a debtor in a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict the tenant solely because of the bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our claim against the tenant for unpaid, future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owned under the lease. Even so, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. 16 Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of our significant tenants were to become bankrupt or insolvent, or suffer a downturn in their business, or fail to renew their leases at all or renew on terms less favorable to us than their current terms. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay or maintain cash distributions to holders of Series B Shares or our common shareholder. Due to a number of factors, including our capital resources, heavy debt load and requirements in our operating environment, our Board decided not to pay a distribution on our common shares and units beginning with the last quarter 2001 and continuing during 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 through to the date of the Acquisition. Further in April 2002, our Board decided to suspend the declaration and payment of dividends on our Series B Shares. We subsequently resumed the payment of dividends on our Series B Shares with dividends of $0.5625 per share in April, July and October of 2004 and January and April 2005. Concurrent with the completion of the Acquisition, all accrued but unpaid distributions on the Series B Shares, plus distributions on our Series B Shares for the third quarter of 2005, were paid to the holders of our Series B Shares. On July 1, 2005, we funded both (i) one quarterly distribution of $0.5625 per share on our Series B Shares to preferred shareholders of record as of June 15, 2005 and (ii) six quarters of distributions totaling an additional $3.3750 per share on our Series B Shares to preferred shareholders of record as of June 21, 2005. Under our charter, these distributions represent the distributions for the first quarter of 2004 through to, and including, the entire third quarter of 2005. After the closing of the Acquisition on July 1, 2005, our newly constituted Board declared a distribution to Prime Office, the holder at that time of the 26,488,389 common limited partnership interests in our Operating Partnership and our 236,483 common shares, in an amount of $1.1225 per unit/share and having a record date and a payment date of July 5, 2005. In addition, our Board declared a distribution to the holders of the 26,488,389 common limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and the 236,483 common shares, in an amount of $2.8438 per unit/share and having a record date of February 9, 2006 and a payment date of February 10, 2006. On December 30, 2005, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.5625 per share on our Series B Shares for the shareholders of record on January 16, 2006. This dividend was paid on January 31, 2006. Under our declaration of trust, this dividend is deemed to be a quarterly dividend related to the fourth quarter of 2005 dividend period. On February 9, 2006, our Board declared a quarterly dividend on our Series B Shares for the first quarter of 2006 of $0.5625 per share. The quarterly dividend has a record date of March 31, 2006 and a payment date of April 28, 2006. Dividends paid on our Series B Shares have been determined to be a return of capital to shareholders. There can be no assurances as to the timing and amounts of any future dividends on our Series B Shares and the declaration of the first quarter 2006 preferred dividend at this time should not be construed to convey any degree of certainty with respect to future preferred dividend payments. Our management and Board review our cash position, debt levels and requirements for cash reserves each quarter prior to making any decision with respect to paying distributions/dividends. Any future distributions on our common shares and/or preferred shares will be made at the discretion of our Board. These distributions will depend on the actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition, capital requirements, the completion of capital events, including refinancings and asset sales, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and such other factors as our Board deems relevant. Distributions on our common shares and common units are not permitted unless all current and any accumulated dividends on our Series B Shares and the related preferred units in the Operating Partnership have been paid in full or declared and set aside for payment. 17 Our current and future joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition and any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners. We own three joint venture interests and in the future we may co-invest with, or sell interests in our existing properties to, third parties through joint ventures. We may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the properties owned through joint ventures. Investments in joint ventures may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present when a third party is not involved, including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Joint venture partners may have business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments also may have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the joint venture partner would have full control over the joint venture. Any disputes that may arise between us and the joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or trustees from focusing their time and effort principally on our business. Consequently, actions by or disputes with joint venture partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party joint venture partners. Tax indemnification obligations in the event that we sell a certain property could limit our operating flexibility. We agreed to indemnify the limited partner of the limited partnership that owns a property encumbered by a mortgage note we hold against specified adverse tax consequences that may result from the refinancing, sale, foreclosure or certain other actions that may be taken with respect to the property or the related mortgage note. If our tax indemnification obligations were to be triggered under this agreement, we would be required to reimburse the covered party for the effects of, or a portion of the effects of, the resulting tax consequences to this party. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, we restructured these obligations. See Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Recent Developments  Continental Towers Refinancing for further discussion. Failure to qualify as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us. We operate our business so as to qualify as a REIT under the Code. Although our management believes that we are organized and operate in such a manner, no assurance can be given that we will continue to be able to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain so qualified. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS that we qualify as a REIT, and the statements in this report are not binding on the IRS or any court. If we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for operations, capital improvements and distributions to holders of Series B Shares and our common shareholder for each of the years involved because:  we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;  we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and  unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. 18 In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to holders of Series B Shares and our common shareholder, and all distributions to such shareholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to raise capital, and would adversely affect the value of our common shares. Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury regulations under the Code is greater in the case of a REIT that, like us, holds its assets through a partnership. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, such as "rents from real property." Also, we must make distributions to shareholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains). In addition, no assurance can be given that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. Even if we qualify as and maintain our status as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. For example, if we were to generate net income from a "prohibited transaction," such income will be subject to a 100.0% tax. We are required to evaluate the internal controls over our financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any adverse results from that evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on the stock price of our Series B Shares and the value of our common shares. We are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission, which include the requirement that we prepare a report on our internal controls over financial reporting. This report must contain an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as of December 31, 2005. We must disclose any material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that were identified by us. Our independent auditors are also required to opine on their assessment of our internal controls. If we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent auditors are unable to give us an satisfactory opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the value of our Series B Shares and common shares. Other regulations could adversely affect our financial condition. Our properties also are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and safety requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants. We believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with all such regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance, however, that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed which would require significant unanticipated expenditures and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and pay distributions to holders of Series B Shares and our common shareholder. 19 Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements that involve risk, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, and that such arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations. Potential losses may not be covered by insurance. Our properties are covered by comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage, rental loss and all-risk insurance provided by various companies and with deductibles, limits and policy specifications customarily covered for similar properties. Certain types of losses, however, may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, such as losses due to floods, riots or acts of war, or may be insured subject to specified limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. See Item 1  Business  Insurance. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose our investment in and the anticipated future cash flow from the affected property and may be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness, to the extent it is recourse indebtedness, or other obligations related to such property. The construction of new developments adjacent to or near certain of our existing properties may adversely affect the leasing, operation and value of those properties. Two large new developments being built by third parties are currently under construction adjacent to two of our properties, one near our 77 West Wacker Drive property and the other near our property located at 330 North Wabash Avenue. While to our knowledge neither of these projects under development currently contemplate any office component and thus will not directly compete with the existing use of our properties, the major construction activities underway at these adjacent sites could cause significant disruptions to the operation of our two properties identified above, including those resulting from noise, dust, vibrations, construction traffic and other related activities. These activities could inconvenience our tenants at these properties and make it difficult to renew certain leases as their terms expire or lease vacant space in these properties to new tenants. In addition, the new projects currently under construction may also adversely affect our leasing efforts and the value of our properties affected, by among other things, blocking certain views from our properties and creating increased traffic and congestion. We may incur significant costs of complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the federal government or an award of damages to private litigants. Although we believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with these requirements, we may incur additional costs to comply with the ADA. In addition, we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA and any other legislation, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to holders of Series B Shares and our common shareholder could be adversely affected. 20 Liabilities for environmental matters could adversely affect our financial condition. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in such property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator was responsible for, or even knew of, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigation, removal or remediation of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to rent or sell such property or to borrow using such property as collateral and may expose such owner or operator to liability resulting from any release of or exposure to such substances. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at another location also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. Certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances. In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and development of real properties, we may be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs, including governmental penalties and injuries to persons and property. See Item 1  Business  Government Regulations  Environmental Matters for a more detailed discussion of environmental matters affecting us. Future terrorist attacks in the United States could harm the demand for, and the values of, our properties. Future terrorist attacks in the U.S., such as the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, and other acts of terrorism or war could harm the demand for and the value of our properties. Terrorist attacks also could directly impact the value of our properties through damage, destruction, loss or increased security costs, and thereafter the availability of insurance for such acts may be limited or may cost more. To the extent that our tenants are impacted by any future attacks, their ability to continue to honor obligations under their existing leases with us could be adversely affected. In addition, certain tenants have termination rights in respect of certain casualties. If we receive casualty proceeds, we may not be able to reinvest such proceeds profitably or at all, and we may be forced to recognize taxable gain on the affected property. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. 21
