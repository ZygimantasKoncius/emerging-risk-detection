Risk Factors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Companys management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Companys estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for the Companys conclusions. The Company continually evaluates the information used to make these estimates as its business and the economic environment changes. The Companys management believes that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on its financial statements, so the Company considers these to be its critical accounting policies. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized as product is shipped and related services are performed in accordance with all applicable revenue recognition criteria. For these transactions the Company applies the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title generally transfers upon shipment of goods from the Companys warehouse. The Company does not have an obligation or policy of replacing customer products damaged or lost in transit. In some instances, the Company ships product directly from its suppliers to the customers. In these cases, the Company recognizes revenue when the product is accepted by the customers representative. For certain products, the Company offers preseason early-order programs that carry extended terms whereby customers may order and take delivery of products prior to the selling season. Products sold under preseason programs have no right of return. The Company applies the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent. The Companys application of EITF 99-19 includes evaluation of its terms with each major customer relative to a number of criteria that management considers in making its determination with respect to gross versus net reporting of revenue for transactions with its customers. Managements criteria for making these judgments place particular emphasis on determining the primary obligor in a transaction and which party bears general inventory risk. The Company records all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenue, and related costs as cost of sales, when incurred, in accordance with EITF 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs. As part of its revenue recognition policy, the Company records an accrual of estimated incentives payable to its customers as a reduction of revenue at the time the related revenues are recorded. The Company bases its estimates on contractual terms of the programs and estimated or actual sales to individual customers. Actual incentives payable in any future period are inherently uncertain and, thus, may differ from its estimates. If actual or expected incentives were significantly greater than the reserves the Company had established, the Company would record a reduction to net revenues in the period in which the Company made such determination. 20 Table of Contents In addition to various incentive programs, from time to time, the Company is required to provide mark-down funds to certain of its mass retail customers to assist them in clearing slow-moving inventory. These mark-down funds are accrued as a reduction of revenue at the time that the related revenues are recorded. The Company is also required to provide for the cost of labor associated with resetting store displays. Resets involve removing slow-moving inventory and replacing it with new products. Although reset costs are paid to third parties who perform the services, they are considered an incentive to our mass merchandise customers. For existing products that are replaced, the Company accrues an estimate for the cost as in increase to cost of goods sold in advance of the reset at the time that the related revenues are recorded. The Company bases its estimates on a number of factors, including information obtained from our customers about their future plans. The cost for any new products or space that is gained is expensed as incurred as an increase to cost of goods sold. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company regularly analyzes significant customer balances, and, when it becomes evident a specific customer will be unable to meet its financial obligations to the Company, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position, a specific allowance for doubtful account is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount that is believed reasonably collectible. The Company also records allowances for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer and historical experiences. If circumstances related to specific customers change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted. Inventories The Companys inventories are primarily composed of finished goods and are recorded at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method. For inventory shipped out of the Woodard facility in Owosso, Michigan, inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined principally by the use of the standard cost method which approximates first-in, first-out (FIFO), or market. The Company provides estimated inventory allowances for excess, slow-moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value. These reserves are based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Goodwill The Company assesses the carrying values of goodwill annually as of June 30 or when circumstances dictate that the carrying value might be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is analyzed at the reporting unit level, which for Craftmade has been defined as Mass and Specialty. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. In the event that an impairment is determined to have occurred, the Company will reduce the carrying value of the asset in that period. The estimated fair value of reporting unit as of June 30, 2009 was determined using a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flow or DCF analysis) and the market approach (application of relevant revenue or income multiples, based on comparable companies). The discounted cash flow method calculates the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. In order to determine the present value of these future cash flows for each reporting unit, it was necessary to forecast future revenues, cost of revenues, other operating expenses and capital expenditures. Management based these forecasts on current information and expectations about our operations, activities and strategies, as well as the impact of the economic environment and actions or our suppliers, customers and competitors. It should be noted that any such forecasts are subjective and inherently uncertain. Each DCF was prepared on an invested capital basis. Invested capital refers to the aggregate of all classes of debt and equity invested in the business. In preparing a DCF analysis on an invested capital basis, forecasted debt-free cash flow is discounted to present value at the reporting units respective weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Interest expense is excluded from the forecast as debt-free cash flow represents an economic benefit that is available to all capital holders of an enterprise. The result of this analysis is to develop a measure of invested capital value. 21 Table of Contents The market approach involves gathering information about comparable publicly traded guideline companies. Guideline companies provide a reasonable basis for comparison to the relative investment characteristics of the entity being valued. For our analysis, we were able to select representative publicly traded companies that operate in similar industries as Craftmade. We analyzed the latest financials and operating statistics of each of these publicly traded companies. We calculated the high, low, mean, and median for the invested capital to revenue and the invested capital to EBITDA multiples. From this analysis, we selected the appropriate multiple and applied it to Craftmades reporting units associated figure. We then weighted the resulting values based on our assessment of the credibility and appropriateness of the given multiple, resulting in a market based measure of invested capital. We believe that both of these approaches have strengths and drawbacks. The DCF analysis captures Managements best estimates of earnings potential for the Companys reporting units from a detail level although numerous educated estimates are required throughout the process, which come with an inherent level of uncertainty. The market approach incorporates results of operations for several comparable companies in determining the Revenue and EBITDA multiples applicable, but it can be difficult to find appropriate comparable companies and this approach ignores specific information about future strategies and actions that can be explicitly factored into the DCF approach. Our final valuation took into consideration both approaches, although we placed more weight on the DCF analysis versus the publicly traded guideline approach. We also applied a working capital adjustment to the concluded present value of invested capital for each reporting unit to normalize the surpluses or deficits in working capital at the reporting unit level. In order to assess whether or not goodwill was impaired at the reporting unit level, the values developed in this process were compared with the book value of total equity of each reporting unit. If the reporting units fair value of total equity is greater than the book value of total equity, then goodwill is not impaired and no further undertakings are required. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Deferred income taxes have been provided on unremitted earnings from foreign investees. The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for ultimate realization and will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of these deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax authorities may not always agree with the tax positions taken by the Company. The Company believes it has adequate reserves in the event that a taxing authority differs with positions taken; however, there can be no assurance that the Companys results will not be affected adversely. See Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Variable Interest Entities Variable interest entities (VIEs) are primarily entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability. All VIEs with which the Company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes. The Company has a 50% ownership interest in Design Trends, a limited liability company. In connection with the adoption of FIN 46R, the Company concluded that Design Trends is a VIE and that the Company is the primary beneficiary. Pursuant to the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company consolidates Design Trends. Prior to the acquisition of Marketing Impressions, which became effective on July 1, 2006, the Company had a 50% ownership interest in PHI. The Company also concluded that PHI was a VIE and that the Company was the primary beneficiary. Pursuant to the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company consolidated PHI. Accordingly, the results of operations of PHI have historically been included in the consolidated income before minority interest of the Company. Prior to the acquisition, the minority interest in PHI income was excluded from the Companys consolidated net income. Since the effective date of the acquisition on July 1, 2006, no minority interest exists in PHI, and accordingly, the consolidated net income includes the full amount of PHI results from this date. 22 Table of Contents Overview Management reviews a number of key indicators to evaluate the Companys financial performance, including net sales, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses by segment. A condensed overview of results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, and the corresponding prior year period is summarized in the table that follows (in thousands, except percentage data). Fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 Income Statement by Segment (Dollars in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2009 June 30, 2008 Specialty Mass Total Specialty Mass Total Net sales $ 68,951 $ 80,741 $ 149,692 $ 74,878 $ 62,712 $ 137,590 Cost of goods sold (47,688 ) $ (69,784 ) (117,472 ) (51,203 ) (51,474 ) (102,677 ) Gross profit 21,263 $ 10,957 32,220 23,675 11,238 34,913 Gross profit as a % of net sales 30.8 % 13.6 % 21.5 % 31.6 % 17.9 % 25.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (19,316 ) (11,024 ) (30,340 ) (19,539 ) (8,578 ) (28,117 ) As a % of net sales 28.0 % 13.7 % 20.3 % 26.1 % 13.7 % 20.4 % Depreciation and amortization (815 ) (261 ) (1,076 ) (600 ) (269 ) (869 ) Total operating expenses (20,131 ) (11,285 ) (31,416 ) (20,139 ) (8,847 ) (28,986 ) Income (loss) from operations 1,132 (328 ) 804 3,536 2,391 5,927 Interest expense, net (1,438 ) (1,489 ) Other income (expenses) (142 ) 140 Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests (776 ) 4,578 Provision for income tax (expense) / benefit 409 (1,174 ) Income (loss) before minority interests (367 ) 3,404 Minority interests (721 ) (1,292 ) Net income (loss) $ (1,088 ) $ 2,112 Net Sales. Net sales for the Company increased $12,102,000 or 8.8% to $149,692,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $137,590,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, primarily from the inclusion of two additional quarters of outdoor furniture sales stemming from the Woodard Asset Acquisition. Due to the timing of the acquisition, fiscal 2008 only included two quarters of Woodard furniture sales, while fiscal 2009 included four quarters. This increase is partially offset by declines in sales of ceiling fans, lighting and accessories. Management believes that the decline in the housing market and the overall economic downturn will continue to create a difficult sales environment, particularly in the Specialty segment, which more closely correlates to new home starts. The Company continues to pursue its strategic growth plans, while also focusing on developing and implementing more immediate plans to mitigate the impact of the current economic downturn. Net sales from the Specialty segment decreased $5,927,000 or 7.9% to $68,951,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $74,878,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, as summarized in the following table. The inclusion of two additional quarters of outdoor furniture sales was more than offset by a decrease in fans, lighting and accessories. 23 Table of Contents Net Sales of Specialty Segment (Dollars in thousands) Fans Woodard Lighting & Outdoor Segment Fiscal Year Ended Accessories Furniture Total June 30, 2009 $ 38,156 $ 30,795 $ 68,951 June 30, 2008 $ 50,768 $ 24,110 $ 74,878 Dollar increase (decrease) $ (12,612 ) $ 6,685 $ (5,927 ) Percent increase (decrease) (24.8 %) 27.7 % (7.9 %) The sales of all Specialty products continue to be affected by the extremely weak overall economy, reduced consumer spending and a historically low housing market. Specialty retailers tend to be small independent businesses, and have suffered disproportionately as cash strapped consumers cut spending and alter their buying habits. Many of these Specialty retailers are economically distressed and a small but growing number have either shut their doors or sought protection under federal bankruptcy laws since the beginning of the broad economic downturn. Management continues to focus on introducing new products, expanding accounts and developing cross-selling opportunities for its various product lines to offset the weak housing market. Management believes that long-term growth will be favorably affected by additional product offerings through enhanced product development efforts, as well as selling outdoor furniture products to lighting showrooms and selling outdoor lighting and ceiling fans to patio dealers, and focusing efforts on the hospitality markets. Net sales of the Mass segment increased $18,029,000 or 28.7% to $80,741,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $62,712,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, primarily from the inclusion of two additional quarters of outdoor furniture sales related to the Woodard Asset Acquisition. Net sales from the Mass segment are summarized in the following table: Net Sales of Mass Segment (Dollars in thousands) Woodard Lighting & Outdoor Segment Fiscal Year Ended Accessories Furniture Total June 30, 2009 $ 25,135 $ 55,606 $ 80,741 June 30, 2008 31,461 31,251 62,712 Dollar increase (decrease) $ (6,326 ) $ 24,355 $ 18,029 Percent increase (decrease) (20.1 %) 77.9 % 28.7 % Sales of lighting products and fan and lamp accessories to the Mass segment are primarily from the Companys TSI and Design Trends subsidiaries, both of which experienced declines in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The decrease in net sales of lighting and accessories was primarily the result of: (i) a decline in orders from Lowes related to indoor lighting; (ii) lower sales of non-core drop shipped products; and (iii) lower sales of fan accessories. The decline in lighting net sales was primarily due to reduced retail sales of the mix and match portable lamp program through Lowes. Currently, Design Trends supplies mix and match portable lamps to all 13 Lowes regional distribution centers. 24 Table of Contents Woodard sales were primarily composed of direct import sales to its various mass merchant customers. Most of its products are shipped directly from China. Due to the seasonal nature of outdoor furniture sales, most sales to mass merchants occur from January to April each year. Management believes that sales to Lowes will increase in the coming fiscal year. Based on various line reviews, management believes that it will continue to be a primary vendor for Lowes mix and match portable lamps through Design Trends, and for Lowes lamp accessory/ceiling medallion programs through PHI, although based on feedback from Lowes the Company expects to see a reduction in the number of fan accessory SKUs it provides. Based on the number of outdoor furniture SKUs the Company has placed with Lowes for the upcoming year, the Company expects to see growth in this segment. The Company believes that it will continue to be invited to participate in each of Lowes scheduled line reviews for its existing and new product lines. The line reviews occur on approximately an annual basis for each product category throughout the year and give us the potential to add new SKUs to the Lowes program. However, participation in line reviews could also result in a partial or complete reduction of either subsidiarys existing SKUs in the product lines currently offered to Lowes. Management believes that the future growth of the Mass segment is contingent upon the success of the Companys ongoing efforts to introduce new products, styles and marketing concepts to existing customers and the expansion of the business to new customers. Gross Profit. Gross profit of the Company as a percentage of net sales decreased 3.9% to 21.5% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to 25.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 primarily due to the inclusion of two additional quarters of sales of Woodard products that carry a lower gross profit, as well as decreased margins in the traditional fan and lighting business in the Specialty segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the Specialty segment decreased 0.7% to 30.9% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to 31.6% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease is summarized in the following table: Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales of Specialty Segment Fans Woodard Lighting & Outdoor Segment Fiscal Year Ended Accessories Furniture Total June 30, 2009 33.8 % 27.2 % 30.8 % June 30, 2008 35.2 % 24.2 % 31.6 % Percent decrease (1.4 %) 3.0 % (0.8 %) The decrease is due to the inclusion of an additional two quarters of the lower margin outdoor furniture lines that carry lower gross profit than lighting and furniture, as well as a decrease in margins realized on the traditional fan and lighting business. Fan and lighting margins in the Specialty segment were down from the results generated in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, as the economic downturn made it difficult for the Company to pass all cost increases to its customers. Gross profit as a percent of net sales on the outdoor furniture business increased year over year, as higher pricing was locked in prior to the onset of the broader economic slump late in 2008. 25 Table of Contents Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the Mass segment decreased 4.4% to 13.5% of net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to 17.9% of net sales in the same prior year period, as summarized in the following table: Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales of Mass Segment Woodard Lighting & Outdoor Segment Fiscal Year Ended Accessories Furniture Total June 30, 2009 22.8 % 9.4 % 13.6 % June 30, 2008 26.2 % 9.6 % 17.9 % Percent decrease (3.4 %) (0.2 %) (4.3 %) Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for lighting products and ceiling fan accessories in the Mass segment decreased as a result of changes in vendor programs. Outdoor furniture gross profit as a percent of net sales in the Mass segment is traditionally low as all sales are direct import, and remained relatively flat to those achieved in fiscal 2008. For fiscal year 2010, gross profit as a percentage of net sales of lighting products and ceiling fan accessories in the Mass segment is expected to increase over the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as the Company has been working to gain cost concessions from its key vendors and transition to lower cost vendors where possible. Management believes that the gross profit as a percentage of net sales for Woodard will show slight improvements over fiscal year 2009 as a result of selective price increases used to offset material costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses of the Company increased $2,223,000 to $30,340,000 or 20.3% of net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $28,117,000 or 20.4% of net sales for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to inclusion of two additional quarters of expenses related to the Woodard outdoor furniture business. The expenses for the historical Craftmade business decreased by $1,350,000 during fiscal 2009, and Woodard expenses were added at a much lower rate than achieved in fiscal 2008. Woodard expenses for all four quarters of fiscal 2009 were $10,474,000 compared to $6,901,000 for two quarters that were reported in fiscal 2008. This indicates, on average, quarterly expenses of $2,619,000 for Woodard for fiscal 2009 compared to average quarterly expenses of $3,451,000 for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 24%. This reduction is due to the completion of the integration of the Woodard business into Craftmade, as well as broad cost cutting efforts across the board. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (Dollars in thousands) Increase/ Fiscal Year Ended (Decrease) June 30, June 30, Over Prior 2009 2008 Year Period Historical Craftmade $ 19,866 $ 21,216 $ (1,350 ) Woodard Incremental 10,474 6,901 3,573 $ 30,340 $ 28,117 $ 2,223 26 Table of Contents The historical Craftmade expenses were primarily impacted by lower variable costs, and reductions across the board, offset only slightly by an increase in salaries and property taxes, as summarized below: Historical Craftmade Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (Dollars in thousands) Increase/ Fiscal Year Ended (Decrease) June 30, June 30, Over Prior 2009 2008 Year Period Salaries & Wages $ 7,278 $ 7,170 $ 108 Commissions 2,259 2,754 (495 ) Accounting, Legal And Consulting 2,331 2,468 (137 ) Advertising 1,654 2,079 (425 ) Health Insurance 864 1,102 (238 ) Property Taxes 472 339 133 Warehouse Expense 389 512 (123 ) Trade Shows 169 289 (120 ) Other 4,450 4,503 (53 ) $ 19,866 $ 21,216 $ (1,350 ) The reduction in commissions is a variable cost driven by the decrease in net sales, while the reduction in accounting, legal and consulting fees is primarily driven by the reduction from higher legal and consulting costs in fiscal 2008 associated with the search for a new chief executive officer. Advertising expenses and participation in trade shows for the traditional Craftmade business were significantly reduced in fiscal 2009, as part of broad cost cutting efforts. Health insurance expenses were also lower in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as compared to the prior year due to decreased claims. Given the completion of the Woodard integration and broad cost cutting efforts in the second half of fiscal 2009, management expects total SG&A expense for fiscal 2010 to decrease. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense of the Company increased $207,000 to $1,076,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $869,000 for the same period last year. The increase resulted from two additional quarters of depreciation on Woodard assets and increased depreciation related to purchases of tooling, equipment and computer hardware. Interest Expense. Net interest expense of the Company decreased $51,000 to $1,438,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $1,489,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Interest expense decreased as a result of lower average interest rates in effect as compared to the prior year offset somewhat by higher average outstanding debt balances. Other income and expense. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the Company realized a one-time expense of $125,000 related to a waiver granted by the Frost National Bank regarding the Companys non-compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio contained in its loan agreement with such bank as of December 31, 2008. The Company recognized a gain of $140,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, for leasing the oil and gas mineral rights at its principal place of business in Coppell, Texas. Minority interest. Minority interest expense decreased $571,000 to $721,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $1,292,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease in minority interest resulted from lower profits at Design Trends as a result of the decline in net sales. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income tax was a tax benefit of $409,000 or 27% of net loss before income taxes for fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $1,174,000 or 36% of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 The effective tax rate is calculated by dividing income tax expense by income after minority interest and before income taxes. The effective tax rates presented are weighted averages of our multiple legal entities with effective income tax rates that differ from the statutory United States federal income tax rate of 34% due to the impact of state income taxes. The resulting consolidated effective rate can be significantly different than the statutory United States federal income tax rate of 34% due to the effect of operating losses in certain legal entities of the Company being offset by gains in other entities. The resulting consolidated effective tax rate is not necessarily representative of the effective tax rate in any of the individual tax entities of the Company. See Note 5  Income Taxes in the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding the Companys policy for determining the provision for income taxes. 27 Table of Contents Fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 Income Statement by Segment (Dollars in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2008 June 30, 2007 Specialty Mass Total Specialty Mass Total Net sales $ 74,878 $ 62,712 $ 137,590 $ 59,925 $ 43,425 $ 103,350 Cost of goods sold (51,203 ) (51,474 ) (102,677 ) (38,745 ) (32,314 ) (71,059 ) Gross profit 23,675 11,238 34,913 21,180 11,111 32,291 Gross profit as a % of net sales 31.6 % 17.9 % 25.4 % 35.3 % 25.6 % 31.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (19,539 ) (8,578 ) (28,117 ) (14,900 ) (6,251 ) (21,151 ) As a % of net sales 26.1 % 13.7 % 20.4 % 24.9 % 14.4 % 20.5 % Depreciation and amortization (600 ) (269 ) (869 ) (548 ) (251 ) (799 ) Total operating expenses (20,139 ) (8,847 ) (28,986 ) (15,448 ) (6,502 ) (21,950 ) Income from operations 3,536 2,391 5,927 5,732 4,609 10,341 Interest expense, net (1,489 ) (1,441 ) Other expenses 140  Income before income taxes and minority interests 4,578 8,900 Provision for income taxes (1,174 ) (1,482 ) Income before minority interests 3,404 7,418 Minority interests (1,292 ) (1,507 ) Net income $ 2,112 $ 5,911 Net Sales.

Net sales from the Specialty segment increased $14,953,000 or 25.0% to $74,878,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $59,925,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, primarily from the acquisition of the assets of Woodard, LLC, as summarized in the following table.

The decrease in net sales of Trade Source was primarily the result of: (i) a decline in orders from Lowes related to indoor lighting and outdoor lighting; (ii) lower sales of non-core drop shipped products; and (iii) lower sales of fan accessories. In November 2006, Lowes notified Trade Source that it will no longer source the 14 indoor and outdoor lighting SKUs previously sold by Trade Source to Lowes via direct import. The final shipments were shipped in during the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. Additional information is detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The decline in Design Trends net sales was primarily due to reduced retail sales of the mix and match portable lamp program through Lowes. Woodard sales were primarily composed of direct import sales to its various mass merchant customers. Most of its products are shipped directly from China. Due to the seasonal nature of outdoor furniture sales; most sales to mass merchants occur from January to April each year. Gross Profit. Gross profit of the Company as a percentage of net sales decreased 5.8% to 25.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to 31.2% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, primarily due to increased sales of Woodard products that carry a lower gross profit as compared to net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the Specialty segment decreased 3.7% to 31.6% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to 35.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The decrease is summarized in the following table: Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales of Specialty Segment Fans Woodard Lighting & Outdoor Segment Fiscal Year Ended Accessories Furniture Total June 30, 2008 35.2 % 24.2 % 31.6 % June 30, 2007 35.3 %  35.3 % Percent decrease (0.1 %) na (3.7 %) For fiscal year 2008, gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the ceiling fan and lighting sales in the Specialty segment was only slightly down from the results generated in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, as the Specialty segment was able to offset the increases in cost of goods with a price increase that was effective April 15, 2008. 29 Table of Contents Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the Mass segment decreased 7.7% to 17.9% of net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to 25.6% of net sales in the same prior year period, as summarized in the following table: Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales of Mass Segment Woodard Lighting & Outdoor Segment Fiscal Year Ended Accessories Furniture Total June 30, 2008 26.2 % 9.6 % 17.9 % June 30, 2007 25.6 %  25.6 % Percent increase/(decrease) 0.6 % na (7.7 %) Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for lighting products and ceiling fan accessories saw a slight overall increase as a result of changes in vendor programs. Woodard gross profit as a percent of net sales is low as all sales are direct import. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses of the Company increased $6,966,000 to $28,117,000 or 20.4% of net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $21,151,000 or 20.5% of net sales for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain assets of Woodard, LLC.

Health insurance expense was higher in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, as compared to the prior year due to increased claims. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense of the Company increased $70,000 to $869,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $799,000 for the same period last year. The increase resulted primarily from increased depreciation related to computer system upgrades. Interest Expense. Net interest expense of the Company increased $48,000 to $1,489,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $1,441,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Interest expense increased as a result of higher average outstanding debt balances stemming from the acquisition of certain net assets of Woodard, LLC, which was somewhat offset by lower average interest rates in effect as compared to the prior year. Other income. The Company realized a gain of $140,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, for leasing the oil and gas mineral rights at its principal place of business in Coppell, Texas. Minority interest. Minority interest expense decreased $215,000 to $1,292,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $1,507,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The decrease in minority interest resulted from lower profits at Design Trends as a result of the decline in net sales. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income tax was $1,174,000 or 35.7% of net income before income taxes for fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $1,507,000 or 20.0% of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. See Note 5  Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding the Companys policy for determining the provision for income taxes. 31 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 The Companys cash decreased $885,000 from $1,269,000 at June 30, 2008 to $384,000 at June 30, 2009. Net cash used by the Companys operating activities was $409,000 compared to $11,778,000 in cash provided by the Companys operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, a reduction of $12,187,000. The decrease in cash flow from operations resulted primarily from operating losses and increased receivables, as sales slowed and customers paid slower during the broad economic downturn. The $1,713,000 of cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, was primarily related to the addition of property, equipment and tooling and additional contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Marketing Impressions in 2006. Cash provided by financing activities of $1,237,000 primarily consists of amounts drawn on the Companys line of credit and is partially offset by distributions to minority interest members totaling $750,000 and principal payments on the Companys notes. On July 10, 2009, the Company, together with certain of its direct or indirect subsidiaries (the Borrowers) entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Revolving Loan Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America). The Revolving Loan Agreement provides for revolving loans in an aggregate amount up to $40,000,000 and is secured by substantially all of the Borrowers assets, excluding its current real estate holdings. The Revolving Loan Agreement will terminate on July 10, 2012. On July 10, 2009 WoodardCM, LLC (Woodard), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Craftmade entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the Term Loan Agreement) with The Frost National Bank, San Antonio, Texas (Frost), in conjunction with executing a Term Loan Note (the Frost Note), in the principal amount of $3,500,000, payable to Frost, secured by Woodards primary manufacturing and distribution facility located in Owosso, Michigan. The Term Loan Agreement will terminate on July 10, 2012. In the aggregate, the proceeds from the Revolving Loan Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement, were used to pay off amounts owed under the Frost Loan Agreement dated as of December 31, 2007. The Companys management believes that its new line of credit, combined with cash flows from operations, will be adequate to fund the Companys current operating needs and debt service payments over the next 12 months. Management anticipates that future cash flows will be used primarily to retire existing debt, fund potential acquisitions or other investments that will enhance long-term stockholder value and distribute earnings to its minority interest member. The Company remains committed to its business strategy of creating long-term earnings growth, maximizing stockholder value through internal improvements, making selective acquisitions and dispositions of assets, focusing on cash flow and retaining quality personnel. Management believes that given the current volatility in the housing and debt markets, it is in the best interest of long-term stockholder value for management to continue to evaluate selective and opportunistic acquisitions. Management believes this strategy, if successful, could enhance the Companys product offerings and potentially enable the Company to expand into adjacent product categories and sales channels that are less reliant on the overall housing environment. There can be no assurances, however, that any agreement regarding any such acquisition will be consummated. Fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 The Companys cash increased $341,000 from $928,000 at June 30, 2007 to $1,269,000 at June 30, 2008. Net cash provided by the Companys operating activities increased $4,736,000 to $11,778,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to $7,042,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The increase in cash flow from operations resulted primarily from the timing of the Woodard Asset Acquisition and subsequent collection of working capital after the acquisition date, and lower inventories and receivables due to lower sales of lighting and accessories, offset by the reduction in cash due to lower income from operations. The $16,851,000 of cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the acquisition of certain net assets of Woodard, LLC, and contingent payments related to the acquisition of Marketing Impressions. 32 Table of Contents Cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from the cash borrowed to purchase certain assets of Woodard, LLC, offset by (i) cash dividends of $2,560,000, (ii) distributions to minority interest members totaling $1,225,000 and (iii) cash flow from operations that sweeps to the line of credit. Fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 The Companys cash decreased $1,236,000 from $2,164,000 at June 30, 2006 to $928,000 at June 30, 2007. Cash decreased as a result of the Company sweeping excess cash balances against its line of credit on a daily basis at PHI beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2006, funds used to acquire Marketing Impressions and lower net income in fiscal 2007 as compared to prior fiscal years. Net cash provided by the Companys operating activities decreased $792,000 to $7,042,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, compared to $7,834,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The decrease in cash flow from operations resulted primarily from (a) lower net income, (b) lower accounts payable from the settlement of balances arising from the acquisition of Marketing Impressions and (c) a reduction in accrued customer allowances primarily from the loss of the indoor and outdoor lighting business with Lowes. These amounts were offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances driven in part by lower net sales in fiscal 2007. The $3,607,000 of cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the acquisition of Marketing Impressions and the ongoing upgrade of existing computer systems. Cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from (i) cash dividends of $2,498,000, (ii) distributions to minority interest members totaling $1,674,000 and (iii) principal payments on the Companys notes payable of $1,134,000. These amounts were offset by $671,000 of proceeds from our line of credit. Contractual Obligations The table below, as well as the information contained in Note 4  Long-Term Obligations and Note 8  Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements, summarizes the Companys various repayment requirements at June 30, 2009. The Company expects to meet these obligations with cash flows from existing operations or by renewing and extending its line of credit, although there can be no guarantee of such results. 33 Table of Contents Summary of Contractual Obligations At June 30, 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Payments Due By Period Less than 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year Years Years 5 years Lines of credit(1) $ 20,042 $ 20,042 $  $  $  Note payable $ 10,317 $ 494 $ 1,089 $ 1,240 $ 7,493 Operating lease obligations $ 2,461 $ 727 $ 1,239 $ 495 $  Capital lease obligations $ 69 $ 48 $ 21 $  $  Guaranteed royalties $ 199 $ 90 $ 109 $  $  Assumed interest(2) $ 4,716 $ 1,017 $ 1,211 $ 1,060 $ 1,428 Woodard Restructuring $ 155 $ 155 $  $  $  Teiber consulting agreement $ 67 $ 67 $  $  $  Contingent consideration(3) $  $  $  $  $  Liability for uncertain tax positions(4) $  $  $  $  $  Total $ 38,025 $ 22,639 $ 3,669 $ 2,795 $ 8,921 (1) Based on Frost line of credit in place at June 30, 2009.

Lines of Credit and Notes Payable The Companys long-term obligations are summarized in the following table: Summary of Long Term Obligations (Dollars in thousands) Outstanding Outstanding Balance Balance Current Commitment June 30, 2009 June 30, 2008 Interest Rate Maturity Revolving line of credit(1) $ 50,000 $ 20,042 $ 17,374 LIBOR plus 1.50% December 31, 2009 Note payable  facility n/a 10,317 10,779 6.5 % December 10, 2017 Capital lease obligation n/a 69 113 7.6 % November 5, 2010 Sub-total 30,428 28,266 Less: current amounts due (542 ) (507 ) Long-term obligations $ 29,886 $ 27,759 (1) Based on Frost line of credit in place at June 30, 2009. As of July 10, 2009 Frost line of credit has been replaced with a new line of credit with Bank of America providing up to $40,000,000 in revolving loans, supplemented by a $3,500,000 note with Frost. As of June 30, 2009 the Companys primary revolving line of credit was held by a banking group led by The Frost National Bank (Frost) and including Whitney National Bank and Commerce Bank, N.A., under, a Third Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the Frost Loan Agreement) signed December 31, 2007 and maturing on December 31, 2009. Total credit lines available to Craftmade and its subsidiaries under this agreement were $50,000,000, and there was $3,832,000 available to borrow under the applicable borrowing base at June 30, 2009. The Company satisfied all obligations under the Frost Loan Agreement by repaying all outstanding amounts on July 10, 2009, and no other fees or payments are due or expected in relation to this agreement, or the related notes. 34 Table of Contents On July 10, 2009, Craftmade together with the Borrowers, entered into the Revolving Loan Agreement with Bank of America. The Revolving Loan Agreement provides for revolving loans in an aggregate amount up to $40,000,000 and is secured by substantially all of the Borrowers assets, excluding its current real estate holdings. On July 10, 2009 Woodard entered into the Term Loan Agreement with Frost, in conjunction with executing the Frost Note, in the principal amount of $3,500,000, payable to Frost, secured by the Michigan Facility. In the aggregate the proceeds from the Revolving Loan Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement (together the Loan Agreements), were used to pay off amounts owed under the Frost Loan Agreement dated as of December 31, 2007. Loans under the Revolving Loan Agreement may be deemed to be either Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Rate Loans. Base Rate Loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (a) the Prime Rate (as published by Bank of America); (b) the Federal Funds Rate, plus 0.50%; or (c) 30 day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.25% based on Craftmades cash flow performance as measured by the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Loan Agreement) for the most recent month. LIBOR Rate Loans will bear interest at LIBOR for the applicable interest period (30, 60 or 90 days), plus an applicable margin ranging from 3.00% to 4.00% based on Craftmades cash flow performance as measured by the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Loan Agreement) for the most recent month. The maximum amount of loans under the Revolving Loan Agreement will be determined by a formula (the Borrowing Base) taking into consideration the receivables and inventory of the Borrowers, net of any reserves put into place by Bank of America. The Revolving Loan Agreement will terminate on July 7, 2012. Pursuant to the Revolving Loan Agreement, the financial covenants require Craftmade to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of not less than 0.85 for the initial periods, and building to not less that 1.0 by August, 2009 and thereafter. All wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of Craftmade, and Design Trends have agreed to be guarantors of the Revolving Loan Agreement (the Guarantors). Should Craftmade achieve and maintain a minimum of $6,000,000 of availability (calculated as the Borrowing Base minus the principal balance of all loans) for 60 days, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall not be tested until such time as availability drops below $6,000,000. The Frost Note bears a floating interest rate based on Prime Rate (as published in the Wall Street Journal) plus 2.0% per annum. Pursuant to the Frost Note, Woodard has agreed to pay equal monthly payments of principal and interest based on a 10-year amortization schedule, with the unpaid principal and interest payable on July 7, 2012. As security for the payment and performance of the Frost Note, Woodard granted a mortgage lien to Frost in the Michigan Facility located at 210 S. Delaney Road, Owosso, Michigan, which Woodard acquired as part of the Woodard Asset Acquisition. On the Closing Date, Craftmade and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries entered into guaranty agreements (Guaranties) with Frost pursuant to which such entities agreed to guarantee payment and performance of the Note by Woodard. Further information regarding this Revolving Loan Agreement and Notes is detailed in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 16, 2009. On November 14, 2007, the Company entered into a term loan to refinance its home office and warehouse with an original principal balance of $11,000,000. The loan is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest of $95,822. The loan bears an interest rate of 6.5% per year. The loan is collateralized by the building and land. The loan is scheduled to mature on December 10, 2017. Further information regarding this loan is detailed in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 20, 2007. Operating and Capital Lease Obligations Operating and capital lease obligations include rents for the Companys properties (see Item
