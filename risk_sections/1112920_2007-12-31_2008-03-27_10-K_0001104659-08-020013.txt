Item 1A. Risk Factors We have described below risks that we are aware of that could have a material adverse effect on your stock ownership and our business. Risks Related to Operations If we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unable to continually improve the performance, features, and reliability of our existing products and services, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products, product upgrades, and services on a timely basis. We have in the past incurred, and we believe that we will continue to incur, research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive. New product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including: 10 Managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements, which has frequently been longer than we originally expected. Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers. Extending the operation of our products and services to new platforms and operating systems. Entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experience. Managing new product and service strategies, including integrating our various security and file replication technologies, management solutions, customer service, and support into unified enterprise security and file replication solutions. Incorporating acquired products and technologies. Developing or expanding efficient sales channels. Obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products, including source code licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systems. If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, we could have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing sufficient revenues in return, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results. We are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors, including competition, product obsolescence, technological change, budget constraints of our actual and potential customers, level of broadband usage, awareness of security threats to IT systems, and other factors. While such factors may, in some periods, increase product sales, fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales. If demand for our products declines, our revenues and gross margin could be adversely affected. If we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers, our operating results could be adversely affected. We sell our products to customers primarily through our direct sales force and through resellers. Sales through these different channels involve distinct risks, including the following: Direct Sales. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales by our direct sales force to end-users. Special risks associated with this sales channel include: Longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts. Difficulty in hiring, retaining, and motivating our direct sales force. Substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive, including regular updates to cover new and revised products. 11 Indirect Sales Channels. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels, including distributors that sell our products to end-users and other resellers. This channel involves a number of risks, including: Our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end-users. Our resellers and distributors are not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers. Our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause. Our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing products and may, from time to time, place greater emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing, promotions, and other terms offered by our competitors Our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer configurations, which could result in errors or product failures. Because we offer very complex products, undetected errors, failures, or bugs may occur, especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released. Our products are often installed and used in large-scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software, and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors, failures, or bugs in our products. Our customers computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time-consuming. In addition, despite testing by us and others, errors, failures, or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments. In the past, we have discovered software errors, failures, and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and have experienced delayed or lost revenues during the period required to correct these errors. Errors, failures, or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity, product returns, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive position, or claims by customers or others. Many of our end-user customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other, less critical, software products. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our end-user customers systems, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions, delays, or cessation of our product licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results. We have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions that give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results. We have in the past acquired, and we expect to acquire in the future, other businesses, business units and technologies. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges, including: · Complexity, time, and costs associated with the integration of acquired business operations, workforce, products, and technologies into our existing business, sales force, employee base, product lines, and technology. · Diversion of management time and attention from our existing business and other business opportunities. · Loss or termination of employees, including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees. 12 · Assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation related to alleged liabilities of the acquired business. · The incurrence of additional acquisition-related debt as well as increased expenses and working capital requirements. · Dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders, or earnings per share. · Increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. · Substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses, write-off of in-process research and development, impairment of goodwill, amortization of intangible assets, and stock-based compensation expense. If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or undergo other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee. To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations. We also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests, and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitions in such markets have stronger market positions. Any of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions. In addition, because acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. We utilize open source software in some of our products. The open source software community develops software technology for free use by anyone. We have relied on open source technology for the encryption features in our CuteFTP Pro and Secure FTP Server products. Our reliance on open source code software may impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our solution and may subject us to possible intellectual property litigation. We incorporate a limited amount of open source code software into our products, and we may use more open source code software in the future. Open source code may impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products because, among other reasons, open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our solution, and open source software cannot be protected under trade secret law. In addition, it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the acquired software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Claims of infringement or misappropriation against us could be costly for us to defend and could require us to seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our solution, to re-engineer our solution or to discontinue the sale of our solution in the event re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis. If this occurs, our business and operating results could be harmed. In addition, from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. We use a limited amount of open source software in our solution and may use more open source software in the future. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Any of this litigation could be costly for us to defend, hurt our results of operations and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solution. 13 If we lose key personnel we may not be able to execute our business plan. Our future success depends on the continued services of key members of our management team. These individuals are difficult to replace because of the intense competition for similarly skilled people. In addition, new members of the management team may not be productive for weeks or months as they learn about our products and the administration within GlobalSCAPE. We may not be able to compete effectively with larger, better-positioned companies, resulting in lower margins and loss of market share. We operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets, our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop in revenues that could adversely affect our business and operating results. To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services, effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors, appropriately respond to competitive strategy, and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed, used, and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets. If we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands, we could experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our financial results. We compete with a variety of companies who have significantly greater revenues and financial resources than GlobalSCAPE as well as greater personnel and technical resources. For example, CuteFTP and CuteFTP Pro compete with products offered by Ipswitch, Inc. and Microsoft Corporation, EFT competes with products from Sterling Commerce and several other vendors, and WAFS competes with Riverbed Technology which recently completed an initial public offering. Large companies may be able to develop new technologies more quickly than we can, to offer a broader array of products, and to respond more quickly to new opportunities, industry standards or customer requirements. For example, Sterling Commerce receives approximately $50 million in maintenance contract revenue annually, providing them with significant resources for product development and marketing. Some competitors may also be able to adopt more aggressive pricing strategies. For example, Ipswitch gives an older version of its file transfer protocol program away for free for non-commercial use, and Microsoft includes file transfer protocol functionality in its internet browser, which it distributes for free. Increased competition may result in lower operating margins and loss of market share. Additional competitors may enter the market and may have significantly greater capabilities and resources than we do. It may be difficult for us to recruit software developers and other technical and management personnel because we are a relatively small company. We compete intensely with other internet software development and distribution companies internationally to recruit and hire from a limited pool of qualified personnel. Some qualified candidates prefer to work for larger, better known companies.. In order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and equity-based compensation. The volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees. In addition, we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans, and recent changes in accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of employee stock options and other forms of equity-based compensation as compensation expense. As a result, we may decide to issue fewer equity-based incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees, or conversely, if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Key personnel have left our company in the past and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future. The loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives, the effectiveness of our disclosure 14 controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and the results of our operations. In addition, hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future revenues. Our ability to develop our software will be seriously impaired if we are not able to use our foreign subcontractors. We rely on foreign subcontractors to help us develop our software. If these programmers decided to stop working for us, or if we were unable to continue using them because of political or economic instability, we would have difficulty finding comparably skilled developers. In addition, we would likely have to pay considerably more for the same work, especially if we used U.S. personnel. If we could not replace the programmers, it would take us significantly longer to develop our products. We may incur losses as we attempt to expand our business. We intend to expand our business and therefore expect to expend significant additional resources on developing our sales force, developing a more robust reseller program, research and development, marketing and product development. As a result, we may need to expend significant resources to accomplish these goals. If we fail to successfully develop and market new products or improve our direct and channel sales results, we may not be able to achieve the necessary revenue growth and may not be profitable. Our operations are vulnerable to security breaches that could harm the quality of our products and services or disrupt our ability to deliver our products and services. Third parties may breach our system security and damage our products and services or misappropriate confidential customer information. This might cause us to lose customers, or even cause customers to make claims on us for damages to them. In addition, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches and/or to address problems caused by such breaches. Increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. We offer technical support services with many of our products. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers. Further customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. Our products may expose customers to invasion of privacy, causing customer dissatisfaction. Our Secure FTP Server and Enhanced File Transfer are intended to provide outsiders access to a customers computer, making the customer vulnerable to security breaches, which could result in the loss of their privacy or property. Customers suffering invasions of privacy or other harm could result in customer dissatisfaction and possible claims against us for any resulting damages. Risks Related to Stock Ownership Our stock price is/may be volatile. The trading price of our common stock has been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to certain factors, including: Quarter-to-quarter variations in results of operations; Our announcements of new products; 15 Our competitors announcements of new products; Our product development or release schedule; General conditions in the software industry; and Investor perceptions and expectations regarding our products, plans and strategic position and those of our competitors and customers. In addition, the public stock markets experience extreme price and trading volume volatility, particularly in high-technology sectors of the market. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. The broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. Our financial results may be affected by non-cash and other accounting charges, including: Amortization of intangible assets, including acquired product rights Impairment of goodwill Stock-based compensation expense Restructuring charges Impairment of long-lived assets For example, in connection with our acquisition of Availl in 2006, we have recorded approximately $5.2 million of acquired product rights and other intangible assets and $4.6 million of goodwill. We have recorded and will continue to record future amortization charges with respect to a portion of these intangible assets. In addition, we will evaluate our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, goodwill, acquired product rights, and other intangible assets, whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be impaired. We do not pay dividends on our common stock. We have not paid a dividend on our common stock and have no plan to do so in the near future. In addition, the terms of our revolving credit facility prohibit the payment of dividends. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter and Delaware law could inhibit others from acquiring us. Some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in Delaware law could, together or separately: discourage potential acquisition proposals; delay or prevent a change in control; and limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws prohibit stockholders from voting by written consent or calling meetings of the stockholders. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a 16 broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in the statute, for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Our directors and executive officers continue to have substantial control over us Our directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates and related persons, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 46% of our outstanding common stock at December 31, 2007. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control GlobalSCAPE and direct its policies including the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, such as the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for our Board of Directors to be divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms. As a result, approximately one-third of our Board of Directors will be elected each year. Stockholders ownership of our stock may be significantly diluted, affecting the value of the stock. There were options for 1,960,328 shares outstanding under our employee stock option plans as March 1, 2008, of which 971,493 were vested as of March 1, 2008. We have filed a registration statement under the Securities Act, covering stock issued upon the exercise of options by non-affiliates, and we may file a registration statement covering options held by affiliates as well. If we do not file a registration statement covering affiliates, affiliates who exercise their options may choose to sell the stock under an exemption from registration, such as Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The exercise of these options and sale of the resulting stock could depress the value of our stock. Risks Related to Legal Uncertainty We are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third-party intellectual property rights particularly because our products are partially developed by independent parties. We may be exposed to future litigation based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that some of the code in our products is developed by independent parties or licensed from third parties over whom we have less control than we exercise over internal developers. In addition, we expect that infringement claims against software developers will become more prevalent as the number of products and developers grows and the functionality of software programs in the market increasingly overlaps. Claims of infringement could require us to re-engineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering its products. In addition, an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property, or the use of significant resources to defend against this type of claim could place a significant strain on our financial resources and harm our reputation. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights. Our software code, and trade and service marks are some of our most valuable assets. Given the global nature of the internet and our business, we are vulnerable to the misappropriation of this intellectual property, particularly in foreign markets, such as China and Eastern Europe, where laws or law enforcement practices are less developed. The global nature of the internet makes it difficult to control the ultimate destination or security of our software making it more likely that unauthorized third parties will copy certain portions of our proprietary information or reverse engineer the proprietary information used in its programs. If our proprietary rights were infringed by a third-party, and we did not have adequate legal recourse, our ability to earn profits, which are highly dependent on those rights, would be severely diminished. Other companies may own, obtain or claim trademarks that could prevent limit or interfere with our use of our trademarks. Our various trademarks are important to our business. If we were to lose the use of any of our trademarks, our business would be harmed and we would have to devote substantial resources towards 17 developing an independent brand identity. Defending or enforcing our trademark rights at a local and international level could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Item 1B.
