RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE OPERATIONS PRODUCT LINE EXPANSION STRATEGIES; ENTRY INTO NEW MARKETS. The Company's expansion of its current product lines is contingent, among other things, upon the Company's ability to develop and/or acquire additional lines of complementary institutional furniture which can be purchased or manufactured in a cost efficient manner and sold at competitive prices in the Company's markets. Developing viable new products requires capital and takes time. The Company may not be able to develop new products at a speed or cost that allow us to timely capitalize on market opportunities or counter competition. Over the past few years, the Company worked at developing a new generation multipurpose room table and invested substantial capital resources in its development. The Company ultimately was unsuccessful at developing a cost-effective repeatable process to manufacture the table. The Company anticipates continuing to market its existing table line as it continues to look for other ways that it can expand its product line. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be successful in developing new products to expand its product line. DOWN-TURN IN FURNITURE INDUSTRY. Beginning in fiscal 2002, and continuing through fiscal 2004, the Company faced one of the most significant down-turns ever in the global furniture industry. Industry analysts reported declines in the United States office furniture market of 18% for calendar year 2001, 19% in 2002, and 4% in 2003. These years constitute an unprecedented three consecutive year decline in an industry that only had three down years between 1971 and 2000. Companies throughout the world reduced their spending across many capital goods categories, including furniture. Revenue and order rates across the industry fell throughout calendar 2001, 2002, and 2003 as customers delayed and canceled orders. Demand for furniture products continued to soften as corporate profits remained under pressure during recent years. Demand for the Company's products was also adversely impacted by declines after September 11, 2001 in the hospitality and recreational markets. Terror 11 threats, war, economic uncertainty, and related uncertainties contributed to the downturn. However, during the past year, the furniture industry experienced a recovery, increasing by 5 percent. The near term outlook for the institutional furniture industry also is improving as industry experts believes shipments increased by 17 percent in the first quarter of this year and that the total increase for the year will be 11 percent. Although the outlook is improving, if conditions do not improve, or begin to decline again, the Company would be negatively impacted. INFLATION AND INCREASING RAW MATERIAL COSTS. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, the Company experienced rapidly increasing costs in most of its raw materials, including steel, plastic, and wood. In response to the increase, the Company implemented two separate price increases on most of its product lines. The Company has been able to achieve most of the price increases in its table lines, but the price increases in its chair lines have been slower in responding to the price increase. The Company still expects that it can achieve the price increase in all of its product lines. However, the Company cannot predict whether it will be able to achieve the implemented price increases or what effects the price increases might have on sales volumes. Sales may decline. Although the Company is unable to predict whether the price of its raw materials will continue to increase, further increases would erode the Company's gross margin without additional price increases for the Company's products. COMPETITION. The Company is facing increased competition because of innovations in competitors' products and lower pricing brought on by the general down-turn in the furniture industry. More of the Company's competitors have begun introducing products that directly compete with the products offered by the Company, including competitors who are manufacturing their products offshore at a lower cost. The Company's products are generally more expensive than products sold by the Company's competitors in the same markets. The Company believes that competition for its products is generally based on product quality and characteristics, service and price. Unless the Company adapts and responds to these competitive threats, the Company will face margin pressure from low cost producers. Only certain elements of the Company's products are patented, so unpatented elements could be reverse engineered and duplicated by competitors who are able to develop the manufacturing equipment and processes to do so. The Company's continued success will depend upon, among other things, its ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality, high performance products at prices competitive in the markets served by the Company. Although the Company is developing new products, it is uncertain at this time what the marketplace acceptance will be for these products. POTENTIAL DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE SEATING PRODUCTS. During fiscal 2005, our Broda operations continued to become a more significant part of our consolidated results of operations and contributed significantly to our net income. Sales of our healthcare seating products may decline if insurance funding for the purchase of such products is limited or eliminated or if regulatory changes occur that adversely affect the funding or demand for such products. In addition, the Company may be unable to expand its geographic markets for healthcare seating products. 12 RECENT ACQUISITION. On April 1, 2004, the Company announced the acquisition of the assets of Versipanel LLC, a manufacturer of portable partitions. The Company believes that this product will allow it to expand its product line and better penetrate the institutional furniture market. However, there can be no assurance made that the Company will be successful in integrating this product line into its existing product offering, or that the planned objectives of the Company with respect to these new products will be achieved. LOSS OF KEY CUSTOMERS. The loss of any key customers of the Company would decrease the Company's revenue. Given the current environment in the furniture industry, the Company cannot assure that it would be able to replace such revenue or reduce its costs and, therefore, the Company's profitability would be adversely impacted. RAW MATERIAL SOURCES. Both the plastic used in the Company's products and the tubing used in its table legs and chairs are manufactured according to Company specifications. Portions of the Company's multipurpose room operations operate without substantial inventory levels of raw materials by depending on certain key suppliers to provide raw materials on a "just-in-time" basis. The Company believes that necessary materials are generally available from alternate suppliers. However, any shortages or significant interruptions in the delivery of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Company's production schedule and operations. WARRANTY SERVICE COSTS. The Company intends to continue to offer warranties covering materials and workmanship on its existing products and anticipates providing a warranty covering materials and workmanship for all complementary product lines developed or acquired by the Company. While the Company has implemented improved quality control measures that it expects will reduce warranty claims, it is possible that warranty servicing costs will increase in future periods. Furthermore, the Company is not in a position to anticipate the additional warranty service costs that may be incurred as a result of the Company's expansion into new or complementary product lines. FUTURE VARIATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS. The Company's short-term profitability could be adversely affected by its decision to develop or acquire complementary product lines, hire additional sales staff, and pursue additional acquisitions. Various factors, including acquisition related expenses, the ability to find and train qualified personnel, operational transitions, timing of new product introductions and the cost of penetrating new markets and changes in product mix, may have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. While the Company believes that the addition of new product lines will increase the Company's long-term profitability, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to experience profitability at historical rates. The Company may experience temporary fluctuations in operations and quarterly variations in the future. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
