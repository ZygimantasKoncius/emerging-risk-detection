OPERATING SEGMENTS Operating segments are defined as components of a company about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the companys chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. In 2006, the Company reported its operations as three primary segments, Americas, EMEA, and ITSM. The operations of Americas and EMEA include manufacturing and supplies, maintenance of Company and third-party manufactured equipment, integrated systems, BancTec software products sold through Plexus Software (Plexus), a division of BancTec, and business process outsourcing services. The ITSM operations include personal computer repair services and administration of third-party extended-service contracts. ITSM provides warranty services, fulfillment services and related maintenance support to manufacturers of desktop and enterprise IT products in North America and Europe. Americas and EMEA. These two operating segments are responsible for business in North, Central and South America (Americas) and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). These two groups offer a similar portfolio of business process outsourcing, business solutions, technology products and infrastructure services to similar types of clients. The portfolio offerings focus primarily on payment and remittance processing, document and content processing and IT service management. These solutions help drive operational efficiencies through automation of mission critical processes for some of the worlds largest credit card companies, financial institutions, insurance companies, government entities, service providers and consumer goods manufacturers. Information Technology Service Management (ITSM). ITSM provides quality integrated support services to the evolving Information Technology industry, with focused deployment and ongoing support solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEM), outsourcing services providers, systems integrators and technology manufacturers. These services result in cost savings, improved client satisfaction and increased revenues for BancTecs clients. ITSM provides warranty services, fulfillment services and related maintenance support to manufacturers of desktop and enterprise IT products in North America and Europe. 3 Note N  Business Segment Data and Note O  Geographic Operations, contained in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, include detailed financial information concerning the Companys segments and geographic areas. The 2004 segment information has been conformed to the 2005 and 2006 presentation. MARKETS SERVED The Companys portfolio of offerings generally incorporate advanced applications software developed by the Company and by third parties. These solutions may also include hardware developed and manufactured by the Company as well as by third parties. Key applications provided by the Americas and EMEA business units focus on the document and content processing and payment and remittance processing markets. Document and Content Processing. The Companys Document and Content Processing portfolio offers innovative solutions that simplify the capturing, processing and archiving of information across the enterprise. The Company has become a recognized leader in document and content processing by providing clients complete end-to-end solutions for credit card origination, loan/mortgage origination, accounts payable, document imaging and archiving, credit card and loan exceptions processing, claims processing and mailroom automation. While many BancTec solutions are available out of the box, they can also be tailored without incurring high development costs and lengthy implementation timescales. Each BancTec solution can be rapidly deployed and easily adapted to changing requirements. The Companys document and content processing software technology, marketed under the eFIRST brand, is highly scaleable, designed for high-volume, complex and distributed environments. eFIRST Capture provides a software solution to capture structured or unstructured documents from paper scanners, fax machines and e-mail and then extract key information needed to categorize, index and distribute the data to the appropriate person or department. eFIRST Process is a Business Process Management tool that enables business process automation through analysis, modeling, development and deployment. eFIRST Process provides intelligent workflow and routing of documents and cases in complex environments based on business rules. eFIRST Archive can store large volumes of highly complex documents and provide multiple indices for improved search and retrieval. These technologies are available as stand-alone, integrated with BancTec or third-party hardware, or as the foundation for a comprehensive outsourcing solution. The Company also offers document and content processing hardware technology. The DocuScan 9000, introduced in 2004, is a high-speed mixed document scanner designed to provide the highest hourly throughput in difficult paper handling applications. The Company introduced the DocuScan 6000 in 2005 which offers an entry-level high-speed scanner with a compact physical size that can still digitize and process up to 260 pages per minute. The Company provides a complete line of products and services to address the high-volume check or mixed document imaging environment. In addition to the DocuScan family, the company offers the E-Series and X-Series transports. The E-Series is a high-speed transport that can read and sort between 10,000 and 1,000,000 check-size documents per day. The X-Series offers a mid-range transport for check and remittance processing which enables check and item-based transactions to be digitally captured, processed and retained. To help companies achieve optimal performance in day-to-day check imaging operations, the Company offers its advanced image quality software, Image Sentry. Payment and Remittance Processing. The Company is focused on helping clients move into the new era of remittance processing by addressing current challenges around check conversion with ACH, ARC and check truncation with Check 21. The passage of the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (Check 21), which facilitates check truncation by authorizing substitute checks, is expected to result in decreased demand for payment and check clearing solutions. The Companys suite of payment processing solutions take advantage of new technology advances, such as automatic image recognition and internet accessibility, to offset labor costs, facilitate timely research and handle complex transaction variations. The Companys payment processing technology suite includes eCap, a data capture application that automates check and list processing and the extraction of data from invoices or payment advices. PayCourier Retail is a comprehensive remittance software solution for processing payment transactions, such as return documents, customer correspondences, customer envelopes and checks. PayCourier Archive is a transaction archive solution that provides long-term data and image storage for remittance processing. SERVICES PORTFOLIO The Company employs a services portfolio approach to maximize the market penetration and revenue potential from our targeted geographies, horizontal markets and vertical industries. This services portfolio consists of business process outsourcing, business solutions, infrastructure services and products. 4 Business Process Outsourcing. Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) is defined as having the understanding of industry, market and business processes intimately enough to apply tools, methods, products and services to allow our clients to delegate a part of their business for us to manage and deliver through measurable performance metrics. Because BancTec has a strong tradition of technology experience, service excellence and solution expertise, the Company is uniquely positioned for leadership in the rapidly growing market for Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). BancTec has a long history of offering BPO in the U.K., and launched BPO services in the United States in 2005. With outsourcing centers throughout the U.S. and Europe, BancTec offers BPO services for both document and content processing as well as payment and remittance processing. Business Solutions. Business Solutions are defined as the application of tools, methods and processes in conjunction with products and services to deliver business value to meet a clients business need. Utilizing a number of software technologies developed by BancTec and third party providers, as well as BancTecs project implementation processes, the Company provides end-to-end Business Solutions to meet client needs. These solutions are typically implemented at client locations and operated by client staff. Infrastructure Services. Infrastructure Services are defined as the management, support and maintenance of BancTec products and third party products within the IT infrastructure to deliver business and technical value to meet our clients business requirements. The Company provides clients with system support for hardware and software products and provides expertise in the installation, repair and maintenance of large mission-critical, computer- driven electromechanical devices, such as reader/sorters and scanners, which involve imaging and paper handling. The Company employs customer service engineers located in the United States and international locations to perform such service. The Companys maintenance contracts usually include both parts and labor, and the contracts are typically renewed for five to seven years. In addition, the Company markets a full range of consumable supplies that complement the Companys document processing systems. Products. Products are defined as BancTec hardware, software and consumables, as well as, third party hardware and software to meet a clients technology needs. The Company incorporates these Products as an integral part of our Business Solutions. We utilize these products in delivering our Business Process Outsourcing solutions and we offer these products to market through indirect sales. GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS There are no significant risks associated with foreign operations other than the fluctuation of international currencies (in Europe), political environments and economic cycles. The Company does not currently hedge its foreign currency exposure. Note O  Geographic Operations, contained in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, includes detailed financial information concerning the Companys geographic operations. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT The Company is engaged in ongoing software and hardware product development activities for both new and existing products, employing approximately 106 people for such activities as of December 31, 2006. The following table sets forth the Companys product development expenses: For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in thousands) Product Development Expenses $ 7,275 $ 8,823 $ 7,768 Percent of Total Revenue 1.9 % 2.6 % 2.2 % 5 Current expenditures are concentrated on developing new applications for the Companys product lines and improving and expanding existing products. Additional product development funding is provided by customers for customer-specific development activities, which is not included in the expense outlined above, but is instead part of cost of sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. There can be no assurance that the Companys development efforts will result in successful commercial products. Many risks exist in developing new product concepts, adapting new technology and introducing new products to the market. BancTecs Document and Content Processing business is organized around a set of solutions (both licensed and outsourced) and high-level reusable components that form the basis of vertical solutions for specific markets. The Document and Content Solution set includes; A/P Master, a complete solution for accounts payable automation, Document and Image Archive, a hosted capture and archive service, Remit Cycle 360, a comprehensive transaction exchange cycle for the healthcare market that includes providers, payers and banks and eFIRST Origin, a web based mortgage and loan origination solution. The three core modules in the eFIRST suite of solutions are; generic document capture system (eFIRST Capture), business process automation (eFIRST Process) and archiving (eFIRST Archive). In addition, the Company will add key managed services capabilities to these products. eFIRST Capture captures, sorts and processes data from many types of documents, such as e-mail, web, scanned documents, faxes and web-forms, and provides real-time access to this data for subsequent use. eFIRST Process provides a technology platform and user tools to construct workflows, business rules, data views, user environments and access permission models that integrate with existing systems and people to automate business processes. eFIRST Archive addresses the secure, structured storage and future retrieval of data. Image Capture. In 2007, the Company plans to continue developing options for the DocuScan 9000 system and make strategic market-based investments in the E-Series and X-Series transports. All other products are now effectively in a sustaining mode only of development. SALES AND DISTRIBUTION The Company primarily relies on its internal sales force. BancTecs distribution strategy is to employ multiple delivery channels to achieve the widest possible distribution. The Companys products are sold to end-users, distributors, OEMs, value-added resellers and systems integrators. International sales are subject to various risks, including fluctuations in exchange rates, import controls and the need for export licenses. CUSTOMER DIVERSIFICATION For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, Dell, accounted for 19.5%, 15.5%, and 17.4%, respectively, of the total revenue of the Company. The Companys ten largest customers accounted for 48.6%, 45.0%, and 44.3%, of the Companys revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 respectively. COMPETITION In marketing its products and services, the Company encounters aggressive competition from a wide variety of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than BancTec. The Company believes that functionality, performance, quality, service and price are important competitive factors in the markets in which it operates. Generally, the Company emphasizes industry knowledge, unique product features, flexibility, quality and service to configure unique systems from standard components in its competitive efforts. While the Company believes that its offerings compete favorably based on each of these elements, the Company could be adversely affected if its competitors introduce innovative or technologically superior solutions or offer their products at significantly lower prices than the Company. No assurance can be given that the Company will have the resources, marketing and service capability, or technological knowledge to continue to compete successfully. 6 BACKLOG The Company believes that backlog is not a meaningful indicator in understanding BancTecs business nor a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to the large volume of products delivered from shelf inventories and the relative portion of net revenue related to the Companys services businesses. In addition, any backlog information would exclude ITSM contracts, recurring hardware and software maintenance contracts, and contracts for sales of supplies. Further, the Companys backlog is subject to fluctuation due to various factors, including the size and timing of orders for the Companys products and exchange rate fluctuations, and accordingly, is not necessarily indicative of the level of future revenue. MANUFACTURING-SUPPLIERS The Companys hardware and systems solutions are assembled using various purchased components such as PC monitors, minicomputers, image electronics, encoders, communications equipment and other electronic devices. Certain products are purchased from sole source suppliers. The Company generally has contracts with these suppliers that are renewed periodically. The Company has not experienced, nor does it foresee any significant difficulty in obtaining necessary components or subassemblies; however, if the supply of certain components or subassemblies was interrupted without sufficient notice, the result could be an interruption of product deliveries. PATENTS The Company owns numerous U.S. and foreign patents and holds licenses under numerous patents owned by others. The Company also owns a number of registered and common-law trademarks in the U.S. and other countries relating to the Companys trade names and product names. The validity of any patents issued, or that may be issued, to the Company may be challenged by others and the Company could encounter legal difficulties in enforcing its patent rights against infringement. In addition, there can be no assurance that other technology cannot or will not be developed, or that patents will not be obtained by others, that would render the Companys patents obsolete. EMPLOYEES At December 31, 2006, the Company employed approximately 2670 full-time employees. None of the Companys employees is represented by a labor union. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage. WEBSITE ACCESS TO BANCTECS REPORTS BancTecs internet website address is www.banctec.com. The Companys annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) are available free of charge through our website. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Information provided by the Company in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include forward-looking information, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the PSLRA). All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed forward-looking statements. The Company cautions investors that actual results or business conditions may differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors beyond the Companys control. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated results or changes to future operating results over time. The following is a description of some of the important factors that may cause the actual results of the Companys operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired. Business and Economic Conditions Demand for the Companys services could be adversely impacted by economic and political uncertainty. A general economic downturn may adversely impact customers demand for information technology outsourcing, business processing outsourcing and systems integration services. The Companys sales are concentrated to businesses in industries involving 7 high volume transaction processing, including banking, financial services, insurance, health care and high technology, and to governmental agencies. Business or economic conditions, such as consolidation with the industry, that cause customers in these industries to reduce or delay their investments in document processing products and solutions, such as those offered by the Company, could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including its business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Technological Changes and Product Transitions The Companys industry is characterized by continuing improvement in technology, which results in the frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles and continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics. The Company must incorporate these new technologies into its products and solutions in order to remain competitive. The Company may not be able to continue to manage technological transitions. A failure on the part of the Company to effectively manage the transition of its product lines to new technologies on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect, specifically reductions in sales, on the Company. In addition, the Companys business depends on technology trends in its customers businesses. Many of the Companys traditional products depend on the efficient handling of paper-based transactions. To the extent that technological changes impact the future volume of paper transactions, the Companys traditional business may be adversely impacted. Competition The business processing outsourcing and the information technology outsourcing industries are highly competitive. Certain of the Companys competitors have greater financial resources and may develop solutions or services which may make the Companys service offerings obsolete. These situations may impact the Companys ability to win new contracts or develop and expand service offerings. In addition, competition places downward pressure on operating margins, particularly for technology outsourcing contract extensions or renewals. As a result, the Company may not be able to maintain current operating margins for technology outsourcing contracts extended or renewed in the future. Contract Profitability The pricing and other terms of customer contracts require the Company to make estimates and assumptions at the time these contracts are entered into that could differ from actual results. These estimates reflect the Companys best judgments regarding the nature of the contract and the expected costs to provide the contracted services. In addition, some contracts require significant investments in the early stages, which are expected to be recovered over the life of the contract through billings for services. Increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in the implementation of the services or decreases in the actual work volumes generated under the contracts could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. Customer concentration The Companys success depends upon retention of significant customers. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the top ten customer accounted for 48.6% of total revenue. Customers may be lost due to merger or acquisition, business failure, contract expiration, conversion to a competitor, or conversion to an in-house system. The Company cannot guarantee that they will be able to retain long-term relationships or secure renewals of current contracts in the future. Significant decreases in the volumes under contracts with these significant customers or the loss of any significant customer could leave the Company with a higher level of fixed costs than is necessary to service remaining customers. Key personnel The Companys ability to grow and provide customers with competitive solutions and services is partially dependent on the ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve customers. In addition, the Companys operations depend on the continued efforts of the executive officers and on senior management. If the Company fails to attract, train and retain key management and technically skilled people, the financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Dependence on Suppliers The Companys hardware products depend on the quality of components that are procured from third-party suppliers. Reliance on suppliers, as well as industry supply conditions, generally involves several risks, including the possibility of defective parts (which can adversely affect the reliability and reputation of the Companys products), a shortage of 8 components and reduced control over delivery schedules (which can adversely affect the Companys manufacturing efficiencies) and increases in component costs (which can adversely affect the Companys profitability). The Company has several single-sourced supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity or price considerations. If these sources are unable to provide timely and reliable supply, the Company could experience manufacturing interruptions, delays or inefficiencies, adversely affecting its results of operations. Even where alternative sources of supply are available, qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which could affect operating results adversely. Indebtedness and Impact on Operating Results As a result of the Companys high debt to equity ratio, the Company is required to devote significant cash to debt service. This limits the Companys future operating flexibility and could make the Company more vulnerable to a downturn in its operating performance or a decline in general economic conditions. International Activities The Companys international operations are a significant part of the Companys business. The success and profitability of international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, such as economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries) and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which products are sold. Any unfavorable change in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Fluctuations in Operating Results The Companys operating results may fluctuate from period to period and will depend on numerous factors, including the following: customer demand and market acceptance of the Companys products and solutions, new product introductions, product obsolescence, varying product mix, foreign-currency exchange rates, competition and other factors. The Companys business is sensitive to the spending patterns of its customers, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors beyond the Companys control. In addition, recent laws governing check truncation could reduce the demand for the Companys payment products. Any unfavorable change in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Product Development Activities The strength of the Companys overall business depends in part on the Companys ability to develop products and solutions based on new or evolving technology and the markets acceptance of those products. There can be no assurance that the Companys product development activities will be successful, that new technologies will be available to the Company, that the Company will be able to deliver commercial quantities of new products in a timely manner, that those products will adhere to generally accepted industry standards or that products will achieve market acceptance. Many of the Companys customers use its products in highly regulated or technologically demanding industries. As a result of products introduced by the Companys competitors, generally accepted industry standards can change rapidly in ways that are beyond the control of the Company. ITEM 1B.
