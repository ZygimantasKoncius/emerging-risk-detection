Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry Because substantially most of our current sales are dependent on a single product line, factors that adversely affect the pricing and demand for this product line could substantially reduce our sales. Although we have expanded our product offering, we are still currently dependent on a single integrated process control product line targeting the chemical mechanical polishing market. We expect revenues from this product line to continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for at least the next year. As a result, factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for integrated process controls for the chemical mechanical polishing equipment field, such as competition and technological change, could reduce our sales. The markets we target are highly cyclical and it is difficult to predict the length and strength of any downturn or expansion period. The semiconductor capital equipment market and industries, which are highly cyclical, experienced in 2007 and 2006 significant increases in sales, after a significant decline in 2005, and according to Gartner, a market research company, the forecast for year 2008 predicts a decline in capital spending. Although we rely on market research companies, we cannot predict the length and strength of the downturns or expansions. Furthermore, we have only a limited ability to reduce expenses during any industry downturn because of the need for significant ongoing expenditures related to engineering, research and development and worldwide customer service and support operations. As a result, during future downturns, we may incur additional losses greater than those we incurred in the past. Our inability to reduce spending during a protracted slowdown in the semiconductor industry could reduce our prospects of achieving profitability. Historically, we have derived all of our revenues, and we expect to continue to derive practically all of our revenues, from sales of our products and related services to the semiconductor industry. Our business depends in large part upon capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated demand for semiconductors. The semiconductor industry has experienced severe and protracted cyclical downturns and upturns. During cyclical downturns, we have in the past experienced, and will likely in the future experience, material reductions in the demand for the type of capital equipment and process technology that we offer and our sales and revenues might decline again. In addition, our ability to reduce expenses in response to any downturn or slowdown in the rate of capital investment by manufacturers in these industries may be limited because of:  our continuing need to invest in research and development;  our capital equipment requirements; and  our extensive ongoing customer service and support requirements worldwide. As a result, we may have difficulty achieving profitability. - 2 - If we do not respond effectively and on a timely basis to rapid technological change, our ability to attract and retain customers could be diminished, which would hurt our sales and ability to remain competitive. The semiconductor manufacturing industry is characterized by rapid technological change, new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Our ability to remain competitive and generate sales revenue will depend in part upon our ability to develop new and enhanced systems at competitive prices in a timely and cost-effective manner and to accurately predict technology transitions. Because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales, new product decisions must anticipate the future demand for products. If we fail to correctly anticipate future demand for products, our sales and competitive position will suffer. In addition, the development of new measurement technologies, new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors could cause a decline in our sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products. We may not be able to develop or market new products, which could slow or prevent our growth. Our business plan requires the introduction of several new product lines. Our plans to introduce process control products for photolithography, etch, metal deposition and other processes will require development of new capabilities. Some of these projects are in the early stages of development, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop or bring to market these new product lines or, if we do, that these products will be well received or profitable. If we are unable to successfully introduce new product lines, our future growth could be adversely affected. If any of our systems fail to meet or exceed our internal quality specifications, we cannot ship them until such time as they have met such specifications. If we experience significant delays or are unable to ship our products to our customers as a result of our internal processes, or for any other reason, our business and reputation may suffer. Our products are complex and require technical expertise to design and manufacture. Various problems occasionally arise during the manufacturing process that may cause delays and/or impair product quality. We actively monitor our manufacturing processes to ensure that our products meet our internal quality specifications. Any significant delays stemming from the failure of our products to meet or exceed our internal quality specifications, or for any other reasons, would delay our shipments. Shipment delays could harm our business, revenues and reputation in the industry. New product lines that we may introduce in the future may contain defects, which will require us to allocate time and financial resources to correct. Our new product lines may contain defects when first introduced. If there are defects, we will need to divert the attention of our personnel from our product development efforts to address the detection and correction of the defects. In the past, no liability claims have been filed against us for damages related to product defects, and we have not experienced any material delays as a result of product defects. However, we cannot provide assurances that we will not incur these costs or liabilities or experience these lags or delays in the future. Moreover, the occurrence of such defects, whether caused by our products or the products of another vendor, may result in significant customer relations problems and injury to our reputation and may impair the market acceptance of our products. We have historically generated losses and may incur future losses. Since our inception in 1993, we have had several years of losses and only one profitable year. We may incur a net loss in 2008 or in future years. As of December 31, 2007, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $56 million. We do not plan to increase our aggregate operating expenses in 2008 relative to 2007. However, in order to achieve profitability in 2008, we will need to significantly increase our sales relative to 2007. In the future, our sales may not grow and we may not achieve profitability. Our dependence on a single manufacturing facility magnifies the risk of an interruption in our production capabilities. We have only one manufacturing facility, which is located in Ness-Ziona, Israel. Any event affecting this site, including natural disaster, labor stoppages or armed conflict, may disrupt or indefinitely discontinue our manufacturing capabilities and could significantly impair our ability to fulfill orders and generate revenues, thus negatively impacting our business. - 3 - We experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results, which may adversely impact our stock price. Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past. This trend may continue. A principal reason is that we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of a relatively small number of systems to a relatively small number of customers. As a result, our revenues and results of operations for any given quarter may decrease due to factors relating to the timing of orders, the timing of shipments of systems, and the timing of recognizing these revenues. Furthermore, our quarterly results are affected by the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor capital equipment market and industries. We also have a limited ability to predict revenues for future quarterly periods and, as a result, face risks of revenue shortfalls. If the number of systems we actually ship, and thus the amount of revenues we are able to record in any particular quarter, is below our expectations, the adverse effect may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the revenue shortfall. We depend on a small number of large customers, and the loss of one or more of them would lower our revenues. Like our peers serving the semiconductor market, our customer base is highly concentrated among a limited number of large customers, primarily because the semiconductor industry is dominated by a small number of large companies. We anticipate that our revenues will continue to depend on a limited number of major customers, although the companies considered to be our major customers and the percentage of our revenue represented by each major customer may vary from period to period. The loss of any one of our major customers would adversely affect our sales and revenues. Furthermore, if any of our customers become insolvent or have difficulties meeting their financial obligations to us for any reason, we may suffer losses. We operate in an extremely competitive market, and if we fail to compete effectively, our revenues and market share will decline. Although the market for integrated process control systems used in semiconductor manufacturing is currently concentrated and characterized by relatively few participants, the semiconductor capital equipment industry is intensely competitive. We compete mainly with Nanometrics Inc., Rudolph Technologies Inc., and KLA-Tencor Corp., which manufacture and sell integrated and stand-alone process control systems. In addition, we compete with original semiconductor equipment manufacturers, such as Tokyo Electron Ltd, which manufacture integrated metrology products and with original semiconductor equipment manufacturers, such as Applied Materials Inc., which develop in-situ sensors and products. Established companies, both domestic and foreign, compete with our product lines, and new competitors are entering our market. Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. If a particular customer selects a competitors capital equipment, we expect to experience difficulty in selling to that customer for a significant period of time. A substantial investment is required by customers to evaluate, test, select and integrate capital equipment into a production line. As a result, once a manufacturer has selected a particular vendors capital equipment, we believe that the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor. Accordingly, unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customers expense of switching to our systems, it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales from that customer once it has selected another vendors system for an application. We believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control, including:  the contribution of our equipment to our customers' productivity;  our product quality and performance;  our global technical service and support;  the return on investment (ROI) of our equipment and its cost of ownership;  the breadth of our product line;  our success in developing and marketing new products. and;  the extendibility of our product If we fail to compete in a timely and cost-effective manner against current or future competitors, our revenues and market share will decline. - 4 - The ongoing consolidation in our industry may harm us if our competitors are able to offer a broader range of products and greater customer support than we can offer. We believe that the semiconductor capital equipment market is undergoing consolidation. A number of capital equipment suppliers have been acquired by larger equipment manufacturers. For example, in 2005 Rudolph Technologies Inc. acquired August Technologies Inc., in 2006 Nanometrics Inc. acquired Soluris Inc. and Accent Technologies Inc., and in 2007 KLA-Tencor Corp. acquired Therma-Wave Inc. We believe that similar acquisitions and business combinations involving our competitors and customers may occur in the future. These acquisitions could adversely impact our competitive position by enabling our competitors and potential competitors to expand their product offerings and customer service, which could provide them an advantage in meeting customers needs, particularly with those customers that seek to consolidate their capital equipment requirements with a smaller number of vendors. The greater resources, including financial, marketing and support resources, of competitors involved in these acquisitions could allow them to accelerate the development and commercialization of new competitive products and the marketing of existing competitive products to their larger installed bases. Accordingly, such business combinations and acquisitions by competitors or customers could jeopardize our competitive position. We may not be successful in our efforts to identify, complete and integrate future acquisitions, which could disrupt our current business activities and adversely affect our results of operations or future growth. Any future acquisitions may involve many risks, including the risks of:  diverting managements attention and other resources from our ongoing business concerns;  entering markets in which we have no direct prior experience;  improperly evaluating new services, products and markets;  being unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;  being unable to integrate new technologies or personnel;  incurring the expenses of any undisclosed or potential liabilities; and  the departure of key management and employees. If we are unable to successfully complete future acquisitions or to effectively integrate any future acquisitions, our ability to grow our business or to operate our business effectively could be reduced, and our business, financial condition and operating results could suffer. Even if we are successful in completing acquisitions, we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate the operations of the acquired business without encountering difficulty regarding different business strategies with respect to marketing, integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds and corporate cultures, integration of different point-of-sale systems and other technology and managing relationships with other business partners. One of our customers has no cancellation fee with regard to cancellation of orders. One of our largest customers has no cancellation fee with regard to cancellation of its orders. Because of that, our ability to rely on our backlog for future forecasting in so far as it depends on that customer is impaired and can severely harm our financial results as well as our ability to forecast our financial results. Because we are small, we depend on a small number of employees who possess both executive and technical expertise, and the loss of any of these key employees would hurt our ability to implement our strategy and to compete effectively. Because of our small size and our reliance on employees with both executive and advanced technical skills, our success depends significantly upon the continued contributions of our officers and key personnel. All of our key management and technical personnel have expertise, which is in high demand among our competitors, and the loss of any of these individuals could cause our business to suffer. We do not maintain life insurance policies for our officers and directors. - 5 - Our lengthy sales cycle increases our exposure to customer delays in orders, which may result in obsolete inventory and volatile quarterly revenues. Sales of our systems depend, in significant part, upon our customers adding new manufacturing capacity or expanding existing manufacturing capacity, both of which involve a significant capital commitment. We may experience delays in finalizing sales following initial system qualification while a customer evaluates and approves an initial purchase of our systems. In general, for new customers or applications, our sales cycle takes between three and 12 months to complete. During this time, we may expend substantial funds and management effort, but fail to make any sales. Lengthy sales cycles subject us to a number of significant risks, including inventory obsolescence and fluctuations in operating results, over which we have limited control. Because of the technical nature of our business, our intellectual property is extremely important to our business, and our inability to protect our intellectual property would harm our competitive position. We have obtained 63 U.S. patents and have 24 U.S. patent applications pending. In addition, we have obtained approximately 40 non-U.S. patents and have more than 40 non-U.S. patent applications pending. In August 8, 2006, in connection with the acquisition by us of substantially all the assets of HyperNex, Inc., HyperNex, Inc. assigned to us all of its right, title, and interest in 8 U.S. patents, 3 non-U.S. patents, 6 patent applications filed in countries other than the U.S. and 4 trademarks registered in the U.S. We cannot assure that:  pending patent applications will be approved;  any patents will be broad enough to protect our technology, will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged or invalidated by third parties; or  the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business. We also cannot assure that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or, if patents are issued to us, design around these patents. Furthermore, because patents may afford less protection under foreign law than is available under U.S. law, we cannot assure that any foreign patents issued to us will adequately protect our proprietary rights. In addition to patent protection, we also rely upon trade secret protection, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our confidential and proprietary information. Despite these efforts, we cannot be certain that others will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Furthermore, we may be required to institute legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property. If such legal proceedings are resolved adversely to us, our competitive position and/or results of operations could be harmed. For additional information on our intellectual property, including information regarding a patent infringement lawsuit we commenced against Nanometrics Inc., information regarding patent infringement lawsuits Nanometrics commenced against us, and information with respect to the settlement agreement we have recently reached with Nanometrics, see Intellectual Property starting on page 19 of this report. There has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in the semiconductor and related industries, and similar litigation involving Nova could force us to divert resources to defend against this litigation or deter our customers from purchasing our systems. We have been, and may in the future be, notified of allegations that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by others. In addition, we may be required to commence legal proceedings against third parties, which may be infringing our intellectual property, in order to defend our intellectual property. In the future, protracted litigation and expense may be incurred to defend ourselves against alleged infringement of third party rights or to defend our intellectual property against infringement by third parties. Adverse determinations in that type of litigation could:  result in our loss of proprietary rights;  subject us to significant liabilities, including treble damages in some instances;  require us to seek licenses from third parties, which licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or - 6 -  prevent us from selling our products. Any litigation of this type, even if we are ultimately successful, could result in substantial cost and diversion of time and effort by our management, which by itself could have a negative impact on our profit margin, competitive position and ability to develop and market new and existing products. For additional information on our intellectual property, including information regarding a civil action we commenced against Nanometrics Inc., or Nanometrics, information regarding civil actions Nanometrics commenced against us, and information with respect to the settlement agreement we have reached with Nanometrics, see Intellectual Property on page 19 of this annual report. We depend on a limited number of suppliers, and in some cases a sole supplier. Any disruption or termination of these supply channels may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products and to deliver them to our customers. We purchase components, subassemblies and services from a limited number of suppliers and occasionally from a single source. Disruption or termination of these sources could occur, and these disruptions could have at least a temporary adverse effect on our operations. To date, we have not experienced any material disruption or termination of our supply sources. A prolonged inability on our part to obtain components included in our systems on a cost-effective basis could adversely impact our ability to deliver products on a timely basis, which could harm our sales and customer relationships. Our agreement for exclusive supply of a critical component in our wide angle x-ray diffraction tool called CrystalX has expired as of December 31, 2007 and the loss of this exclusivity could allow a competitor to utilize this unique component and successfully compete with our offering. Our agreement for exclusive supply of a critical component in our wide angle x-ray diffraction tool called CrystalX has expired as of December 31, 2007. The design of this component provides unique advantages to our system which in the hands of our competitors may allow them to successfully compete with us. We are dependent on international sales, which expose us to foreign political and economic risks that could impede our plans for expansion and growth. Our principal customers are located in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Europe and South Korea and we produce our products in Israel. International operations expose us to a variety of risks that could seriously impact our financial condition and impede our growth. For instance, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and import and export license requirements could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in the countries adopting or changing those restrictions, tariffs or requirements. This could reduce our sales by a material amount. Because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales in Asia, our sales could be hurt by the instability of Asian economies. A number of Asian countries have experienced political and economic instability. For instance, Taiwan and China have had a number of disputes, as have North and South Korea, and Japan has for a number of years experienced significant economic instability. We have a subsidiary in Taiwan and we have significant customers in Japan and South Korea as well as in China. An outbreak of hostilities or other political upheaval or economic downturns in these or other Asian countries would likely harm the operations of our customers in these countries, causing our sales to suffer. A large number of our ordinary shares continue to be owned by a relatively small number of shareholders, whose future sales of our stock, if substantial, may depress our share price. If our principal shareholders sell substantial amounts of our ordinary shares, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, the market price of our ordinary shares may fall. As of December 31, 2007, we had 19,369,418 ordinary shares outstanding, and based on reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and on the information provided to us by our transfer agent, 10,199,366 of such shares were held by five shareholders. - 7 - Because as of February 29, 2008, five of our shareholders control approximately 53% of our ordinary shares, they can control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including the election of directors. As of February 29, 2008, five of our shareholders controlled approximately 53% of our outstanding ordinary shares (not including warrants currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of February 29, 2008). As a result, and although we are currently not aware of any voting agreement between such shareholders, if these shareholders voted together or in the same manner, they would have the ability to control the outcome of corporate actions requiring an ordinary majority vote of shareholders as set in the Companys articles of association. Even if these five shareholders do not vote together, each has the ability to influence the outcome of corporate actions requiring the vote of shareholders as set in the Companys article of association. For additional information on our major shareholders, see Major shareholders on page 40. The market price of our ordinary shares may be affected by a limited trading volume and may fluctuate significantly There has been a limited public market for our ordinary shares and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our ordinary shares will continue. An absence of an active trading market could adversely affect our shareholders ability to sell our ordinary shares in short time periods. Our ordinary shares have experienced, and are likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares without regard to our operating performance. We manage our available cash through various investments the market value and liquidity of which is subject to fluctuations. Impairment of our investments could harm our earnings. We manage our available cash through investments in various holdings, types and maturities which are subject to fluctuations that may adversely affect the value of our available cash. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 7% of our available cash was invested in different types of Auction Rate Securities. Investments of our available cash are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the current economic situation, interest rates and other factors may adversely affect the value and the liquidity of our available cash. As a result, we may recognize in earnings the decline in fair value of investments of our available cash when the decline is judged to be other- than- temporary. As of December 31, 2007, we have recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $1.4 million related to the above mentioned Auction Rate Securities. For further information regarding the investment of our available cash, see Item 5B. Liquidity and Capital Resources below and note 2G to the financial statements. Risks Related to Operations in Israel Potential political, economic and military instability in Israel may adversely affect our growth and revenues. Our principal offices and manufacturing facilities and many of our suppliers are located in Israel. Although most of our sales are currently being made outside Israel, political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect our operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Conflicts between Israel and Palestinian militant groups have been ongoing. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. The resumption of hostilities in the region, and the on-going tension in the region, have a negative effect on the stability of the region which might have a negative effect on our business and harm our growth and revenues. For further detail see Political and economic conditions in Israel starting on page 23. Our operations may be disrupted by the obligation of key personnel to perform military service. Some of our executive officers and employees in Israel are obligated to perform up to 36 days of military reserve duty annually until the age of 40 for those serving in combat units and until the age of 45 for non combatants. This time-period may be extended by the Military Chief of General Staff and the approval of the Minister of Defense or by a directive of the Minister of Defense in the event of a declared national emergency. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence for a significant period of one or more of our executive officers or key employees due to military service. To date, our operations have not been materially disrupted as a result of these military service obligations. Any disruption in our operations due to such obligations would adversely affect our ability to produce and market our existing products and to develop and market future products. - 8 - Because most of our revenues are generated in U.S. dollars, but a significant portion of our expenses is incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and mainly New Israeli Shekels, our profit margin may be seriously harmed by currency fluctuations. We generate most of our revenues in U.S. dollars, but incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and mainly New Israeli Shekels, commonly referred to as NIS. As a result, we are exposed to risk of devaluation of the U.S. dollar in relation to the NIS and other currencies. In that event, the dollar cost of our operations in countries other than the U.S. will increase and our dollar measured results of operations will be adversely affected. During 2007, the U.S. dollar devaluated against the NIS by 9%. Our operations also could be adversely affected if we are unable to hedge against currency fluctuations in the future. Accordingly, we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the dollar against other currencies, and mainly the NIS. We participate in government programs under which we receive tax and other benefits. These programs impose restrictions on our ability to use the technologies developed under these programs. In addition, the reduction or termination of these programs would increase our costs. We receive conditional grants from the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor for research and development programs that meet specified criteria. We are also eligible to receive tax benefits under Israeli law for capital investments that are designated as approved enterprises. To maintain our eligibility for these programs and tax benefits, we must continue to meet certain conditions, including paying royalties related to grants received and making specified investments in fixed assets. Some of these programs also restrict our ability to manufacture particular products and transfer particular technology, which was developed as part of the approved enterprises outside of Israel, by requiring approval of the research and development committee nominated by the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor under applicable law. Such approval may be given only if the recipient abides by all the provisions of the law and related regulations. Approval to manufacture products outside of Israel or consent to the transfer of technology, if requested, might not be granted. If we fail to comply with these conditions in the future, the benefits received could be cancelled. We could also be required to pay increased taxes or refund any benefits previously received, adjusted for inflation and interest. In each of 2005, 2006 we recorded an aggregate of $1.9 million, in conditional grants under Israeli government programs, and in 2007 we recorded $2.4 million in conditional grants under Israeli government programs. As of December 31, 2007, our contingent liability to the Office of the Chief Scientist for grants received was approximately $6.2 million. See also Note 9A to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. From time to time, we submit requests for new grants from the Office of the Chief Scientist and for expansion of our approved enterprise programs. These requests might not be approved. Also, the Israeli government may reduce or eliminate these benefits in the future. The termination or reduction of these grants or tax benefits could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we increase our activities outside Israel due to, for example, future acquisitions, our increased activities generally will not be eligible for inclusion in Israeli tax benefit programs. Accordingly, our effective corporate tax rate could increase significantly in the future. Any shareholder with a cause of action against us as a result of buying, selling or holding our ordinary shares may have difficulty asserting a claim under U.S. securities laws or enforcing a U.S. judgment against us or our officers, directors or Israeli auditors. We are organized under the laws of the State of Israel, and we maintain most of our operations in Israel. Most of our officers and directors as well as our Israeli auditors reside outside of the United States and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. Therefore, if you wish to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against us, or our officers, directors and auditors, you will probably have to file a claim in an Israeli court. Additionally, you might not be able to bring civil actions under U.S. securities laws if you file a lawsuit in Israel. We have been advised by our Israeli counsel that Israeli courts generally enforce a final executory judgment of a U.S. court for liquidated amounts in civil matters after a hearing in Israel. If a foreign judgment is enforced by an Israeli court, it will be payable in Israeli currency. However, payment in the local currency of the country where the foreign judgment was given shall be acceptable, subject to applicable foreign currency restrictions. - 9 - Our shares are listed for trade on more than one stock exchange, and this may result in price variations. Our ordinary shares are listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Market and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. This may result in price variations. Our ordinary shares are traded on these markets in different currencies, U.S. dollars on the Nasdaq Global Market and New Israeli Shekels on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. These markets have different opening times and close on different days. Different trading times and differences in exchange rates, among other factors, may result in our shares being traded at a price differential on these two markets. In addition, market influences in one market may influence the price at which our shares are traded on the other. We may be classified as a passive foreign investment Company and, as a result, our U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences Generally, if for any taxable year 75% or more of our gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of our assets are held for the production of, or produce, passive income, we may be characterized as a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our passive income would not include income derived from the sale of our products, but would include amounts derived by reason of a temporary investment of any cash amounts. This characterization could result in adverse U.S. tax consequences to our shareholders, including having gain realized on the sale of our shares be treated as ordinary income, as opposed to capital gain income, and having potentially punitive interest charges applied to such sales proceeds. U.S. shareholders should consult with their own U.S. tax advisors with respect to the U.S. tax consequences of investing in our ordinary shares. We believe that in 2007 we were not a passive foreign investment company. Nonetheless, because of the difficulty determining the value of our assets, there is a risk that we were a passive foreign investment company in 2007. Currently we expect that we will not be a passive foreign investment company in 2008. However, passive foreign investment company status is determined as of the end of the full tax year and is dependent on a number of factors, including the value of a corporations assets and the amount and type of its gross income. Therefore, there can be no assurances that we will not become a passive foreign investment company for the current fiscal year ending on December 31, 2008 or any future year. For a discussion on how we might be characterized as a passive foreign investment company and related tax consequences, please see the section of this annual report entitled U.S. Taxation  Passive Foreign Investment Companies.
