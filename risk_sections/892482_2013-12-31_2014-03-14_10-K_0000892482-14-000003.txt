ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIf any of the following risks actually occur, our results of operations, cash flows and the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted. Although we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our performance or financial condition.Any forecast regarding our future performance, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding estimated revenue, earnings per share or cash flow from our operating activities, reflects various assumptions and is subject to significant uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forecast, including the risks reflected in the risk factors set forth below. Consequently, no forecast or other forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and the variation of actual results or events from such statements may be material and adverse.Risks Affecting Qumu Corporation and Our BusinessesWe may not be successful at implementing our growth strategy.Our growth strategy includes the global expansion of our enterprise video content management software business and optimization of our opportunity in this growing market. We expect to continue to pursue this strategy through internal growth and possible acquisitions.We cannot ensure that this growth strategy will be successful either in the short-term or in the long-term, or that this strategy will generate a positive return on our investment. Further, if the pace and success of video adoption by enterprises does not progress as rapidly as we believe it will, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of limited value.Moreover, we may not execute successfully on our growth strategy because of errors in product planning or timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or lack of appropriate resources. Our growth strategy for our enterprise video content management business includes expanding sales and deployment of these products internationally. We may not be successful in achieving significant sales of these products internationally due to sales distribution challenges, an inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, or other factors. Our failure to successfully execute on our growth strategy, even if the strategy is sound, could result in competitors providing products before we do and loss of market share and sales. Additionally, if we do not effectively communicate our growth strategy to our investors and stakeholders, we may not realize the full benefits that we would otherwise gain through successful execution of that strategy.11Because of our change in strategic direction, our historical financial results may not be indicative of our future financial results. Further, because our operating history with respect to our enterprise video content management software business is limited, our current financial results may provide only a limited basis for investors to assess our current or future business as a whole.We may not be successful in developing new products that further our growth strategy.Our growth strategy includes the development and commercialization of new products, features and functionalities designed to increase revenue and drive earnings growth. The process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends, our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources to developing new products and features before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept. We may not currently possess the proper skills to effectively develop and market new products or to achieve success in new markets. The success of new products depends on several factors, including proper new product definition, development costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products. There can be no assurance that we will develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.We have been investing in initiatives that we believe further our strategy and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect, our operating results may be harmed.We have been dedicating resources to our enterprise video content management software business that we believe further our growth strategy to distribute live, on-demand and downloaded content for a broad range of applications, on any mobile or desktop device. However, the return on our investments in initiatives may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.We face intense competition in all areas of our business and such competition may result in price reductions, lower gross profits and loss of market share.Our products face intense competition, both from other products and from other technologies, both in the U.S. and in international markets. In our enterprise video content management software business, we compete with others such as Kaltura, Cisco, Polycom, vBrick, Brightcove and MediaPlatform who deliver video content to businesses. We expect the intensity of competition we face to increase in the future from other established and emerging companies. In our disc publishing business, we compete with other providers of disc publishing systems and solutions, such as Seiko Epson Corporation and Primera Technology, Inc. Our disc publishing products also compete with online distribution, cloud file sharing and alternative technologies in the storage media industry, such as high capacity hard drives and flash memory.Some of our competitors, particularly competitors for our enterprise video content management software products, may have greater resources than we do, including greater sales, product development, marketing, financial, technical or engineering resources. In addition, because our enterprise video content management software business is relatively new with a limited operating history, our target customers may prefer to purchase software products that are critical to their business from one of our larger, more established competitors.To remain competitive, we believe that we must continue to provide:•Technologically advanced products and solutions that anticipate and satisfy the demands of end-users;•Continuing advancements or innovations in our product offerings, including products with price-performance advantages or value-added features in security, reliability or other key areas of customer interest;•Innovations in video content creation, management, delivery and user experience;•A responsive and effective sales force;•A dependable and efficient sales distribution network;•Superior customer service; and•High levels of quality and reliability.We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors. Competition may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins, increased discounts to customers and loss of market share, and could require increased spending by us on research and development, sales and marketing and customer support.12Technology in our industry evolves rapidly, potentially causing our products to become obsolete, and we must continue to enhance existing products and develop new products to sustain and grow our business.Rapid technological advances, rapidly changing customer requirements and fluctuations in demand characterize the current market for our products. Further, technology substitution is negatively impacting our revenues from our disc publishing products. Our existing and development-stage products may become obsolete if our competitors introduce newer or more appealing technologies. If these technologies are patented or proprietary to our competitors, we may not be able to access these technologies. We believe that we must continue to innovate and anticipate advances in the content management industry in order to remain competitive. If we fail to anticipate or respond to technological developments or customer requirements, or if we are significantly delayed in developing and introducing products, our revenues will decline.Adverse economic conditions, particularly those affecting our customers, resellers and distributors, have harmed and may continue to harm our business.Unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including recession, inflation, lack of access to capital, lack of consumer confidence or other changes have resulted and may continue to result in lower spending among customers in the industries we serve. Unfavorable economic conditions have also resulted and may continue to result in decreased sales to our resellers and distributors.Further, we sell our products throughout the United States, as well as in several international countries to commercial and government customers. Our business may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries such as disruptions in financial markets, reductions in government spending, or downturns in economic activity in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which we operate; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, or regulations. These factors are beyond our control, but may result in further decreases in spending among customers and softening demand for our products.Further, challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, our cash flow may be negatively impacted and our allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.Our sales will decline, and our business will be materially harmed, if our sales and marketing efforts are not effective.We will need to continue to expand and optimize our sales infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and our business. We plan to continue to expand our direct sales force, both domestically and internationally. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use and functionality of our software requires significant time, expense and attention. It can take six months or longer before our sales representatives are fully-trained and productive. Our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to expand and train our direct sales force do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues. In particular, if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel or if new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or increase our revenues.For sales that are made to customers through value-added resellers, distributors or other strategic partners, we depend on these businesses to provide effective sales and marketing support to our products. Our resellers and distributors are independent businesses that we do not control. Our agreements with resellers and distributors do not contain requirements that a certain percentage of such parties' sales are of our products. Further, some of our channel partners are small organizations with limited capital, and our success in distributing our products to end-users will depend upon the continued viability and financial stability of these entities. These channel partners may choose to devote their efforts to other products in different markets or reduce or fail to devote the necessary resources to provide effective sales and marketing support of our products, any of which could harm our business by reducing sales to customers.We believe that our future growth and success will depend upon the success of our direct sales and marketing efforts as well as those of our value-added resellers, distributors or other strategic partners.Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and if we fail to attract and retain talented employees, we may fail to compete effectively.Our future success depends, in significant part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization, particularly in our enterprise video content management software business. Competition in our industry for qualified employees, particularly in senior management, product development and sales, is intense. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.13We sell a significant portion of our products internationally, which exposes us to risks associated with international operations.We sell a significant amount of our products to customers outside the United States, particularly in Europe, Asia and Latin America. International sales accounted for 36% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, 35% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012, and 38% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. We expect that shipments to international customers, including customers in Europe, Asia and Latin America, will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales. Sales outside the United States involve the following risks, among others:•International governments may impose tariffs, quotas and taxes;•The demand for our products will depend, in part, on local economic health;•Political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products;•Restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell in certain markets;•Potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries may limit our recourse against infringing products or cause us to refrain from selling in certain markets;•Potential difficulties in managing our international operations;•The burden and cost of complying with a variety of international laws, including those relating to data security and privacy;•We may decide to price our products in foreign currency denominations;•Our contracts with international distributors and resellers cannot fully protect us against political and economic instability;•Potential challenges operating our China subsidiary in an emerging market characterized by strict government controls;•Potential difficulties in collecting receivables; and•We may not be able to control our international distributors' efforts on our behalf.The financial results of our German, Japanese, Chinese and United Kingdom subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation with our overall financial results. Additionally, we hedge against currency fluctuations associated with foreign currency denominated transactions (principally the Euro) with Qumu Europe. Despite our hedging activity, currency translations and fluctuations may adversely affect the financial performance of our consolidated operations. Currency fluctuations may also increase the relative price of our product in international markets and thereby could also cause our products to become less affordable or less price competitive than those of international manufacturers. These risks associated with international operations may have a material adverse effect on our revenue from or costs associated with international sales.If our domestic or international intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, others may offer products similar to ours or independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our technology and trade secrets which could depress our product selling prices and gross profit or result in loss of market share.We believe that protecting our proprietary technology is important to our success and competitive positioning. In addition to common law intellectual property rights, we rely on patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. However, these legal means afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or remedies to gain or keep any advantages we may have over our competitors.Our competitors, who may have or could develop or acquire significant resources, may make substantial investments in competing technologies, or may apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to manufacture or market our products. Further, although we do not believe that any of our products infringe on the rights of others, third parties have claimed, and may claim in the future, that our products infringe on their rights, and these third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future.Costly litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or “know-how” we own, to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership, scope, or validity of our proprietary rights and the rights of others. Any claim of infringement against us may involve significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties, and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or using our products. The occurrence of this litigation, or the effect of an adverse determination in any of this type of litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as the United States or at all. Our failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may experience significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors.Our quarterly and annual results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. This variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to quarterly 14fluctuations. In addition, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis, particularly on a sequential quarterly basis, may not be meaningful. It may be particularly difficult to make a comparison to our results of operations in periods prior to our acquisition of Qumu, Inc. in October 2011. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.Factors that may affect our results of operations include:•The timing and amount of our recorded revenue, which will depend upon the mix of products and solutions selected by our customers with revenue from paid-up perpetual software licenses being recognized upon delivery, revenue from term software licenses recognized over the term of the contract, and revenue from cloud-hosted services recognized over the term of the subscription agreement;•Timing of customer purchase commitments, including the impact of long sales cycles and seasonal buying patterns;•Variability in the size of customer purchases and the impact of large customer orders on a particular period;•Reductions in our customers' budgets for information technology purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles, due to changing global economic or market conditions;•Future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and•The impact of a recession or any other adverse global economic conditions on our business, including uncertainties that may cause a delay in entering into or a failure to enter into significant customer agreements.The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations. Failure to achieve our quarterly or annual forecasts or to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors will cause our stock price to decline.Fluctuations in our future operating results may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.We have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, and we expect those fluctuations to continue due to a variety of factors. Some of the factors that influence our quarterly operating results include:•The number and mix of products sold in the quarter;•The structure of our licenses, sales to our enterprise video content management software customers, particularly the mix of our software products and solutions involving term licenses, perpetual licenses or subscription arrangements;•The timing of major development projects and market launch of new business platforms;•The availability and cost of components and materials;•Timing, costs and benefits of new product introductions;•Customer order size and delivery timing;•Seasonal factors affecting timing of purchase orders;•Promotions by ourselves or competitors, and the timing of the promotion;•The impact to the marketplace of competitive products and pricing; and•The timing and level of operating expenses; and•General economic and market conditions including market uncertainty. Because of these factors, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to vary in the future. If our operating results are below financial analysts' or investors' expectations, the market price of our common stock may fall abruptly and significantly.Our stock price may be volatile, and a shareholder's investment could decline in value.Our stock price has fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly, making it difficult for an investor to resell shares or to resell shares at an attractive price. The market prices for securities of technology companies, like Qumu, have historically been highly volatile. Future events concerning us or our competitors could cause such volatility, including:•Actual or anticipated variations in our operating results including fluctuations in our recorded revenue, even during periods of significant software contracted commitments and backlog;•Investments required in infrastructure and/or personnel to meet long-term strategic objectives;•Technological innovations or new commercial products introduced by us or our competitors;•Developments concerning proprietary rights;•Changes in senior management;•Potential acquisition or strategic alliance activities;•Investor perception of us and our industry;•General economic and market conditions including market uncertainty;•National or global political events; and•Public confidence in the securities markets and regulation by or of the securities markets. In addition, the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations that affect the market prices for companies in general, and small-capitalization, high-technology companies in particular, which are often unrelated to the operating performance of these 15companies. Any failure by us to meet or exceed estimates of financial analysts is likely to cause a decline in our common stock price. Further, recent economic conditions have resulted in significant fluctuations and significant declines in stock prices for many companies, including Qumu.Future sales of shares of our common stock in the public market may negatively affect our stock price.Future sales of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a significant negative effect on the market price of our common stock. Upon exercise of outstanding options, the number of shares outstanding of our common stock could increase substantially. This increase, in turn, could dilute future earnings per share, if any, and could depress the market value of our common stock. Dilution and potential dilution, the availability of a large amount of shares for sale, and the possibility of additional issuances and sales of our common stock may negatively affect both the trading price of our common stock and the liquidity of our common stock. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we would deem appropriate.Provisions of Minnesota law, our bylaws and other agreements may deter a change of control of our company and may have a possible negative effect on our stock price.Certain provisions of Minnesota law, our bylaws and other agreements may make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or discourage a third-party from attempting to acquire, control of our company, including:•The provisions of Minnesota law relating to business combinations and control share acquisitions;•The provisions of our bylaws regarding the business properly brought before shareholders;•The right of our Board of Directors to establish more than one class or series of shares and to fix the relative rights and preferences of any such different classes or series;•The provisions of our stock option plans allowing for the acceleration of vesting or payments of awards granted under the plans in the event of specified events that result in a “change in control”; •The provisions of our long-term incentive (LTI) program and agreements that require payment of LTI bonus amounts in the event of a “change in control”; and•The provisions of our agreements provide for severance payments to our executive officers in the event of certain terminations following a “change in control.” These measures could discourage or prevent a takeover of our company or changes in our management, even if an acquisition or such changes would be beneficial to our shareholders. This may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.Keeping abreast of, and in compliance with, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public company disclosure requirements, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and in particular Section 404 of that Act relating to management certification of internal controls, new disclosures relating to “conflict minerals”, the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market have required an increased amount of management attention and external resources. We intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.Risks Affecting Our Enterprise Video Content Management Software BusinessIf enterprise video as a communication medium develops more slowly than we expect it to, our future revenue and profitability will be harmed.Our enterprise video content management software solutions allow organizations to capture, organize and distribute content across the extended enterprise to a wide variety of end points, including mobile devices. The demand for our software solutions will depend upon the continued adoption of video as a communication and collaboration tool for the enterprise. Accordingly, our future revenue growth from our software solutions and financial performance depends on the willingness of enterprise customers to use video to communicate with employees and stakeholders. Additionally, many enterprises have internal resources and processes to manage corporate communications, so they may not perceive the benefit of our external solutions. Privacy concerns and transition costs are also factors that may affect a potential customer’s decision to subscribe to an external solution. If customers do not value the benefit of enterprise video or an external solution to allow them to author, manage and distribute video content over corporate networks, the market for our software solutions will not develop at the rate that we anticipate.16Our enterprise video content management software products must be successfully integrated into our customers’ information technology environments and workflows and changes to these environments, workflows or unforeseen combinations of technologies may harm our customers’ experience in using our software products.A significant portion of our sales are made into applications that require our enterprise video content management software products to be integrated into other enterprise workflows, enterprise information technology environments or software functionalities. Any significant changes to enterprise workflows, IT environments or software programs may limit the use or functionality of or demand for our products. As our customers advance technologically, we must be able to effectively integrate our products to remain competitive. Further, current and potential customers may choose to use products offered by our competitors or may not purchase our products if our products would require changes in their existing enterprise workflows, IT environments or software.The growth and functionality of our enterprise video content management software products depend upon the solution's effective operation with mobile operating systems and computer networks.Our enterprise video content management software products are currently compatible with various mobile operating systems including the iOS, Windows Mobile and Android operating systems. The functionality of our enterprise video content management software products depends upon the continued interoperability of these products with popular mobile operating systems. Any changes in these systems that degrade our products' functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive offerings could adversely affect the operability and usage of our video management software products on mobile devices. Additionally, in order to deliver a high quality user experience, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, systems, and networks. We may not be successful in keeping pace with changes in mobile technologies, operating systems, or networks or in developing products that operate effectively within existing or future technologies, systems, and networks. Further, any significant changes to mobile operating systems by their respective developers may prevent our products from working properly or at all on these systems. In the event that it is more difficult for users to access content delivered by our solutions to their mobile devices, if our products do not operate effectively within the most popular operating systems or if popular mobile devices do not offer a high quality user experience, sales of and customer demand for our software products could be harmed.If we lose access to third-party licenses, our software product development and production may be delayed or we may incur additional expense to modify our products or products in development.Some of our enterprise video content management software solutions contain software licensed from third parties. Third-party licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:•Undetected errors or unauthorized use of another person’s code in the third party’s software;•Disagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms, such as royalties payable;•Infringement actions brought by third-party licensees;•That third parties will create solutions that directly compete with our products; and•Termination or expiration of the license.Because of these risks, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive. The loss of these licenses or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or impair the functionality or enhancement of existing products, leading to increased expense associated with licenses of third-party software or development of alternative software to provide comparable functionality for our existing products and modification of our existing products. Further, if we lose or are unable to maintain any of these third-party licenses or are required to modify software obtained under third-party licenses, it could delay the release of new products, delay enhancements to our existing products or delay sales of our existing products. Any delays could result in loss of competitive position, loss of sales and loss of customer confidence in our enterprise video content management software solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.If the limited amount of open source software that is incorporated into our enterprise video content management software products were to become unavailable or if we violate the terms of open source licenses, it could adversely affect sales of our products, which could disrupt our business and harm our financial results.Our enterprise video content management software products incorporate a limited amount of “open source” software. Open source software is made available to us and to the public by its authors or other third parties under licenses that impose certain obligations on licensees that re-distribute or make derivative works of the open source software. We may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the open source software currently incorporated in our products if that software becomes unavailable, obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our enterprise video content management software products. In addition, we must carefully monitor our compliance with the licensing requirements applicable to that open source software. If we have failed or if in the future we fail to comply with the applicable license requirements, we might lose the right to use the subject open source software. The terms of some open source licenses would require us to give our customers significant rights to open source software that is subject to those licenses and is incorporated in our products. This would include the right to obtain from us the source code form 17of that open source software, and the right to use, modify and distribute that open source software to others. We may be required to provide these rights to customers on a royalty-free basis. Those rights might also extend to modifications and additions we make to the subject open source software. That open source software, and those modifications and additions, also might be obtained by our competitors and used in competing products. The enforceability and interpretation of open source licenses remains uncertain under applicable law. Unfavorable court decisions could require us to replace open source software incorporated in our products. In some cases this might require us to obtain licenses to commercial software under terms that restrict our use of that commercial software and require us to pay royalties. In some cases we might need to redesign our software products, or to discontinue the sale of our software products if a redesign could not be accomplished on a timely basis. These same consequences result if our use of any open source software or commercial software is found to infringe any intellectual property right of another party. Any of these occurrences would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We encounter long sales cycles with our enterprise video content management software products, which could adversely affect our operating results in a given period.Our ability to increase revenues and achieve profitability depends, in large part, on widespread acceptance of our enterprise video content management software products by large businesses and other organizations. As we target our sales efforts at these customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In the large enterprise market, the customer's decision to use our products may be an enterprise-wide decision and, therefore, these types of sales require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our applications. Longer sales cycles could cause our operating and financial results to suffer in a given period.Any failure of major elements of our enterprise video content management software operations could lead to significant disruptions in the ability to serve customers, which could damage our reputation, reduce our revenues or otherwise harm our business.Our enterprise video content management software business is dependent upon providing customers with fast, efficient and reliable services. A reduction in the performance, reliability or availability of required network infrastructure may harm our ability to distribute content to our customers, as well as our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers. Our content management software solutions and operations are susceptible to, and could be damaged or interrupted by outages caused by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, Internet or mobile network breakdown, earthquake and similar events. Our solutions are also subject to human error, security breaches, power losses, computer viruses, break-ins, “denial of service” attacks, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and tampering designed to disrupt our computer systems and network communications. Our failure to protect our network against damage from any of these events could harm our business.Our enterprise video content management software operations also depend on web browsers, ISPs (Internet service providers) and mobile networks to provide our customers' end-users with access to websites, streaming and mobile content. Many of these providers have experienced outages in the past, and could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our solutions. Any such outage, delay or difficulty could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our enterprise video content management software products and services, which would harm our business.Changes in laws and regulations related to the Internet or changes in the Internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our products, and could have a negative impact on our business.The future success of our business depends in part upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business applications. Federal, state or international government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the Internet as a commercial medium. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our products in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the Internet or commerce conducted via the Internet. These laws or charges could limit the growth of Internet-related commerce or communications generally, or result in reductions in the demand for Internet-based applications such as ours.In addition, the use of the Internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of Internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease of use, accessibility, and quality of service. The performance of the Internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been adversely affected by “viruses,” “worms” and similar malicious programs and the Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. If the use of the Internet is adversely affected by these issues, demand for our applications could suffer.18Expanding laws, regulations and customer requirements relating to data security and privacy may adversely affect sales of our products and result in increased compliance costs.Our customers can use our products to collect, use and store personal or identifying information regarding their employees, customers and suppliers. Federal, state and international government bodies and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding data security, privacy and the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. These laws and regulations could reduce the demand for our software products if we fail to design or enhance our products to enable our customers to comply with the privacy and security measures required by the legislation.We also must comply with the policies, procedures and business requirements of our customers relating to data privacy and security, which can vary based upon the customer, the customer’s industry or location, and the product the customer selects, and which may be more restrictive than the privacy and security measures required by law or regulation. In particular, the European Union and many countries in Europe have stringent privacy laws and regulations, which may impact our ability to profitably operate in certain European countries or to offer products that meet the needs of customers subject to European Union privacy laws and regulations.The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, our customers’ own requirements and the privacy and security laws and regulations that are applicable to our customers’ businesses may limit the use and adoption of our products and reduce overall demand. Non-compliance with our customers’ specific requirements may lead to termination of contracts with these customers or liabilities to the customers; non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations may lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities.Furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers’ workers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our products effectively. If a customer experiences a significant data security breach involving our software products, our customers could lose confidence in our software’s ability to protect the personal information of their employees, customers and suppliers, which could cause our customers to discontinue use of our products. The loss of confidence from a significant data security breach involving our software products could hurt our reputation, cause sales and marketing challenges to existing and new customers, cause loss of market share or exacerbate competitive pressures, result in an increase in our development costs to address any potential vulnerabilities in our software products, and may result in reduced demand for our software products and reduced revenue from our enterprise video content management software business. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our products in certain industries.Domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives and our customers’ privacy policies and practices may adversely affect our customers’ ability to process, handle, store, use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees, customers and suppliers, which could reduce demand for our products.In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our software products. If the processing of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, our software products would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business.Risks Affecting Our Rimage Disc Publishing BusinessBecause the market for our disc publishing business is mature and our disc publishing products face competition from other technologies, we expect this business to decline over time.The market for our disc publishing products is mature. Further, technology substitution is occurring within this market. Our disc publishing products compete with online distribution, cloud file sharing and alternative technologies in the storage media industry, such as high capacity hard drives and flash memory. We expect technology substitution to be the primary competitive force impacting our disc publishing business over the next several years.Due to the maturity of the market for our disc publishing products and competitive pressures, we expect that the demand for our disc publishing products will decline over time, that the prices for these products may decline in response to competitive pressures, and in general, that the opportunities for revenue growth from these products will be limited. Accordingly, we expect that these factors will cause our revenue from these products to decline over time. However, the rate and the extent to which these factors will cause changes in our disc publishing business cannot be predicted with certainty. A surge in the popularity of any of these alternative technologies, or our inability to successfully offset the decline in demand for our disc publishing products with other sources of revenue, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.19We rely on single-source suppliers for our disc publishing systems, which could cause delays, increases in costs or prevent us from completing customer orders, all of which could materially harm our business.We assemble our disc publishing systems using materials and components supplied by various subcontractors and suppliers. We purchase critical components for our systems, including our Everest printers, other printing components, DVD-R drives, Blu-ray drives, circuit boards, electric motors, machined and molded parts, precision sheet metal assemblies and mechanical parts from third parties. We also purchase consumables (ribbons, ink cartridges and blank recordable CD, DVD and Blu-ray media) used in our disc publishing systems from third parties. Some of our subcontractors and suppliers are the sole source of these components or products. These third parties may also own technology and manufacturing know-how required to manufacture critical components or products. If any of our suppliers is unable to ship critical components, we would be unable to assemble and ship products to our resellers or end-user customers. Similarly, if any of the suppliers of our consumable products is unable to ship these products, we would be unable to fulfill customer orders for those consumable products. If the price of these components or consumables increases for any reason, or if these suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver, we may have to find another source, which could result in interruptions, increased costs, delays, loss of sales and quality control problems. We purchase these components and consumables pursuant to our standard form of purchase order, submitted to the supplier from time to time based upon our estimated needs.The termination or interruption of any of these relationships, or the failure of these manufacturers or suppliers to supply components or products to us on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities, likely would cause us to be unable to meet orders for our products and harm our reputation and our business. For the majority of our critical components and consumables, we have identified alternative suppliers. We depend upon a single-source supplier for our Everest printers and associated ribbons as well as our Rimage Professional Series systems. This single-source supplier is located in Japan. A disruption in the supply of these products and systems from this supplier would adversely affect our results of operations. Also, for these products, it is more difficult to identify an alternative supplier because of the proprietary information and technology currently held by this supplier. Although we own the rights to the technology, if we were unable to effectively transition the technology and proprietary information used by this supplier to alternative suppliers, the design and manufacture of these products to our specifications may be significantly delayed, resulting in potential production delays and significant expense. Further, if we obtain a new supplier for a component or product or use an alternative component in our product or alternative product to fulfill our consumable orders, we may need to conduct additional testing of our products to ensure the product meets our quality and performance standards. Any delays in delivery of our products to end-users, distributors or resellers could be extended, and our costs associated with the change in product manufacturing could increase.The failure of our components and consumables suppliers to supply us with these products consistent with our requirements as to quality, quantity and timeliness could materially harm our business by causing delays, loss of sales, increases in costs and lower gross profit margins.Our disc publishing products must be compatible with products designed and manufactured by others and, in the event of design changes or the introduction of new products by them or us, our products must continue to be compatible with products of others.Our disc publishing systems incorporate computer and related computer equipment, hardware and software manufactured by others. Our products are designed to provide end users with a fully-integrated publishing system and therefore, our products must operate with the computer and related equipment of others to function properly for end users. Problems with the products of others may adversely affect the performance and reliability of our disc publishing system products and damage our reputation with end users. Further, if there are changes in our products, changes in the computer or computer related equipment integrated into our products or if we offer new products, we must maintain compatibility and interoperability of our products with the products of others. We cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt our products to be compatible with any newly designed product of another party. We would likely incur substantial costs to test and “de-bug” any newly designed product that we integrate into our products. Further, our new product development efforts may be hampered by our need to maintain compatibility with the products of others, and we may incur additional expense designing for compatibility.If we do not maintain adequate inventories of component parts, finished goods or consumables for our disc publishing systems, or if we fail to adequately forecast demand, the likely resulting delays in producing our publishing systems or fulfilling customer orders for consumables would damage our business.We forecast production of our disc publishing systems based on past sales and our estimates of future demand. Similarly, we forecast our purchases of consumables (ribbons, ink cartridges and blank recordable CD, DVD and Blu-ray media) for our disc publishing systems based upon past sales of disc publishing systems, past sales of consumables and our estimates of future demand. In the event that we significantly underestimate our needs or encounter an unexpectedly high level of demand for our systems or 20consumables or our suppliers are unable to deliver our orders of components or consumables in a timely manner, we may be unable to fill orders on time which could harm our reputation and result in reduced sales.Our disc publishing systems may have manufacturing or design defects that we discover after shipment, which could negatively affect our revenues, increase our costs and harm our reputation.Our publishing systems are complex and may contain undetected and unexpected defects, errors or failures. If these product defects are substantial, the result could be product recalls, an increased amount of product returns, loss of market acceptance and damage to our reputation, all of which could increase our costs and cause us to lose sales. We carry general commercial liability insurance covering our products with policy limits per occurrence and in the aggregate that we have deemed to be sufficient. We cannot predict, however, whether this insurance is sufficient, or if not, whether we will be able to obtain sufficient insurance to cover the risks associated with our business or whether such insurance will be available at premiums that are commercially reasonable. In addition, these insurance policies must be renewed annually. Although we have been able to obtain liability insurance, such insurance may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, if at all. A successful claim against us or settlement by us in excess of our insurance coverage or our inability to maintain insurance in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.Natural disasters that affect our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business.The manufacturing facilities of many of our suppliers for our disc publishing products are concentrated in certain geographic locations in Asia. Some of these geographic locations are particularly prone to floods, earthquakes, tsunamis or other natural disasters. Any disaster, condition or event that adversely affects any of these facilities, or disrupts cargo operations or freight lanes, would significantly affect our supply of components and products, which could impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products.ITEM 1B.
