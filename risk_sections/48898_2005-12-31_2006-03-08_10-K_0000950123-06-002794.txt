Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors including, but not limited to those set forth below. Any one of these factors could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or future anticipated results. We operate in markets that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect selling prices or demand for our products. We compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price. Our competitive strategy is to design and manufacture high quality products at the lowest possible cost. Our competitors include companies that have greater sales and financial resources than our Company. Competition could affect future selling prices or demand for our products. Lower levels of economic activity in our end markets could adversely affect our operating results. Our businesses operate in several market segments including commercial, industrial, residential, utility and telecommunications. Operating results can be negatively impacted by volatility in these markets. Future downturns in any of the markets we serve could adversely affect our overall sales and profitability. We source raw materials from various suppliers located in countries throughout the world. A disruption in the availability or price of these products could impact our operating results. We use a variety of raw materials in the production of our products including steel, brass, copper, aluminum, bronze, zinc, nickel and plastics. We have multiple sources of supply for these products and are not dependent on any single supplier. However, significant shortages of these materials or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products which would directly impact our results of operations. We continue to increase the amount of product materials, components and finished goods which is sourced from low cost countries, including Mexico, China, and other Asian countries. A political disruption or significant changes related to transportation from one of these countries could affect the availability of these materials and components which would directly impact our results of operations. We engage in acquisitions and strategic investments and may encounter difficulty in integrating these businesses. We have pursued and will continue to seek potential acquisitions and other strategic investments to complement and expand our existing businesses within our core markets. In 2005 we completed five small acquisitions. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate these businesses into our operations. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions into our operations and in managing strategic investments. Therefore, we may not realize the degree or timing of the benefits anticipated when we first enter into a transaction. Our operating results may be impacted by actions related to our lighting integration and rationalization program. We continue to execute a multi-year program to integrate and rationalize our lighting businesses through factory consolidations, workforce reductions and product rationalizations. These activities consist of complex relocations of critical personnel and machinery, as well as hiring and training of new personnel and, in some cases, expansion or other modification to facilities. All of these activities are thoroughly planned and under the 9 Table of Contents direction of experienced management personnel. However, the actions are occurring simultaneous with normal business operations and other initiatives. Therefore, there is a risk that (1) we may not complete the activities on a timely basis and incur duplicate or higher costs, (2) we may lose essential personnel and knowledge in transition and have to reestablish processes and procedures, and (3) our normal operations could be disrupted and interfere with our ability to manufacture and ship our products to satisfy the demands of our customers. Our operating results may be impacted by actions related to our enterprise-wide business system initiative. We continue to implement an enterprise-wide business system across our domestic operations. We have successfully completed two implementations and converted approximately one-half of our users to the SAP system. This activity involves the migration of multiple legacy systems and users to a common SAP information platform. Throughout this process, we are changing the way we conduct business and employeesÂ’ roles in processing and utilizing information. In addition, certain interfaces with our customers and suppliers are impacted which results in changes to the tools we use to take orders, procure material, schedule production, remit billings, make payments and perform other business functions. Based upon the complexity of this initiative, there is risk that (1) we are unable to complete the implementation in accordance with our timeline and incur additional costs, (2) the implementation could result in operating inefficiencies which could impact operating results, and (3) the implementation could impact our ability to perform necessary business transactions. All of these risks could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that may adversely impact our operating results. We are, and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability and environmental matters, which could be significant. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for clean up or other costs or damages under environmental laws.
