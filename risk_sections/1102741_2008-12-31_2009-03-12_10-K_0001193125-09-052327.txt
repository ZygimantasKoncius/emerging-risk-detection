Risk Factors section, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment:  Impact of changing and recently volatile U.S. and global economic conditions;  Our suppliers production levels for the components used in our products;  Our ability to procure required components;  Market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products;  Expansion of our international business, including the opening of offices and facilities in foreign countries;  The timing of the introduction of new products or components and enhancements to existing products or components by us, our competitors or our suppliers;  Fluctuations in the cost of components and changes in the average sales prices of our products;  Fluctuating market demand for our products;  Changes in our customer and product revenue mix;  Our ability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses or assets;  Expenses associated with the start up of new operations or divisions.  Order cancellations, product returns, inventory buildups by customers and inventory write-downs;  Manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start-up of new products and volume production;  Expenses associated with strategic transactions, including acquisitions, joint ventures and capital investments;  Our ability to adequately support potential future rapid growth;  Our ability to absorb manufacturing overhead if revenues decline;  The effects of litigation;  Increases in our sales and marketing expenses in connection with decisions to pursue new product initiatives. Due to the above and other factors, quarterly revenues and results of operations are difficult to forecast, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be predictive of future performance. In one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline. In addition, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline regardless of our operating performance. Our dependence on a small number of suppliers for components, including integrated circuit devices, and inability to obtain a sufficient supply of these components on a timely basis could harm our ability to fulfill orders. Typically, integrated circuit, or IC, devices represent more than 80% of the component costs of our products. We are dependent on a small number of suppliers that supply key components used in the manufacture of our products. Since we have no long-term supply contracts, there is no assurance that our suppliers will agree to supply the quantities of components we may need to meet our production goals. Samsung currently supplies substantially all of the IC devices used in our Flash memory products. Micron, Qimonda and Samsung currently supply substantially all of the DRAM IC devices used in our DRAM products. Our customers qualify specific controller, Flash and DRAM ICs that are components in our products as part of the product qualification process. If any of our suppliers experience quality control problems, our products that utilize that suppliers IC may be disqualified by one or more of our customers. This would disrupt our supply of ICs, reduce the number of suppliers available to us and adversely affect our ability to fulfill our customers product orders. Further, we may be required to qualify a new suppliers IC, which could negatively impact our revenues during the new qualification process. There can be no assurance that we would be able to find and successfully qualify new suppliers in a timely manner or obtain ICs from new suppliers on commercially reasonable terms. Moreover, from time to time, our industry experiences shortages in IC devices and foundry services which have resulted in placing their customers, ourselves included, on component allocation. This means that while we may have customer orders, we may not be able to obtain the materials that we need to fill those orders in a timely manner or at competitive prices. As a result, our reputation could be harmed, we may lose business from our customers, our revenues may decline, and we may lose market share to our competitors. 9 Table of Contents In addition to Flash and DRAM ICs, a number of other components that we use in our products are available from only a single or limited number of suppliers. In the development of our own ASICs, we also depend on certain foundry subcontractors to manufacture these ASICs as well as on certain third-party subcontractors to assemble, obtain packaging materials for, and test these ASICs. Our dependence on a small number of suppliers and the lack of any guaranteed sources of supply expose us to several risks, including:  The inability to obtain an adequate supply of components;  Price increases, late deliveries and poor component quality;  An unwillingness of a supplier to supply such components to us;  A key suppliers or sub-suppliers inability to access credit necessary to operate its business;  Failure of a key supplier to remain in business or adjust to market conditions;  Consolidation among suppliers may result in some suppliers exiting the industry or discontinuing the manufacture of components; or  Failure of a supplier to meet our quality, yield or production requirements. A disruption in or termination of our supply relationship with any of our significant suppliers or our inability to develop relationships with new suppliers, if required, would cause delays, disruptions or reductions in product shipments or require product redesigns which could damage relationships with our customers, could increase our costs or the prices of our products and adversely affect our revenues and business. We have a less diversified customer base and our future success will be dependent on our ability to grow our OEM business. As a result of the divestiture of our Consumer Division in February 2007, we have a less diversified customer base and our future success will be dependent on our ability to grow our business with new customers. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in growing our business with new customers. Our failure to grow our business with new customers will hurt our reputation and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Sales to a limited number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of any key customer would materially reduce our revenues. Historically, a relatively limited number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues. Our ten largest customers accounted for an aggregate of 77.2% of our total revenues in 2008, 74.1% of our total revenues in 2007, and 81.7% of our total revenues in 2006. We had two customers account for more than 10.0% of our revenues, at 34.4% and 15.2%, in 2008, compared to one customer, which accounted for more than 10.0% of our revenues, at 50.1%, in 2007 and two customers, which accounted for more than 10.0% of our revenues at 37.3% and 24.9%, in 2006. Consolidation in some of our customers industries may result in increased customer concentration and the potential loss of customers as a result of acquisitions. In addition, the composition of our major customer base changes from quarter to quarter as the market demand for our customers products changes, and we expect this variability to continue in the future. We expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to contribute materially to our revenues in the foreseeable future. The loss of, or a significant reduction in purchases by, any of our major customers, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Disruption of our operations at our manufacturing facilities would substantially harm our business. Our manufacturing operations are located in our facilities in Santa Ana, California and Penang, Malaysia. Due to this geographic concentration, a disruption of our manufacturing operations, resulting from sustained process abnormalities, human error, government intervention or natural disasters, including earthquakes, power failures, fires or floods, could cause us to cease or limit our manufacturing operations and consequently harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our Penang operation, which has recently begun to produce significant volumes, will continue to ramp production in subsequent quarters. While our management team is overseeing this transition, the operation itself has a limited operating history and we have limited experience operating in foreign countries. As a result, a disruption of our manufacturing operations resulting from ramp-up related challenges such as obtaining sufficient raw materials, hiring of qualified factory personnel, installation and efficient operation of new equipment, and management and coordination of a new logistics network within our global operations could cause us to cease, delay, or limit our manufacturing operations and consequently harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Ineffective management of inventory levels or product mix, order cancellations, product returns and inventory write-downs could adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to properly monitor, control and manage our inventory and maintain an appropriate level and mix of products with our customers, we may incur increased and unexpected costs associated with this inventory. For example, if we manufacture products in anticipation of future demand that does not materialize, or if a customer cancels outstanding orders, we could experience an unanticipated increase in our inventory that we may be unable to sell in a timely manner, if at all. As a result, we could incur increased expenses associated with writing off excess or obsolete inventory. We also maintain inventory, or hubbing, arrangements with certain of our customers. Pursuant to these arrangements, we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customers projected needs but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products. If a customer does not take our products under a hubbing arrangement in accordance with the schedule it originally provided us, our predicted future revenue stream could vary substantially from our forecasts and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, since we own inventory that is physically located in a third partys warehouse, our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired, causing our total inventory turns to decrease, which could increase expenses associated with excess and obsolete inventory and 10 Table of Contents negatively impact our cash flow. In addition, while we may not be contractually obligated to accept returned products, we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relations with our customers. Product returns would increase our inventory and reduce our revenues. Alternatively, we could end up with too little inventory and we may not be able to satisfy demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships. Our risks related to inventory management are exacerbated by our strategy of closely matching inventory levels with product demand, leaving limited margin for error. We have had to write-down inventory in the past for reasons such as obsolescence, excess quantities and declines in market value below our costs. These inventory write-downs were $3.8 million in 2008, $2.5 million in 2007 and $2.1 million in 2006. We have no long-term volume commitments from our customers. Sales of our products are made through individual purchase orders and, in certain cases, are made under master agreements governing the terms and conditions of the relationships. Customers may change, cancel or delay orders with limited or no penalties. It is difficult to accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future. Anticipating demand is challenging because our customers face volatile pricing and unpredictable demand for their own products, and are increasingly focused on cash preservation and tighter inventory management. We have experienced cancellations of orders and fluctuations in order levels from period-to-period and we expect to continue to experience similar cancellations and fluctuations in the future, which could result in fluctuations in our revenues. We may be less competitive if we fail to develop new and enhanced products and introduce them in a timely manner. The enterprise-storage, enterprise-server, video-on-demand (VoD), PC mobile computing and consumer-related markets and military and industrial applications markets are subject to rapid technological change, product obsolescence, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in end-user requirements and evolving industry standards. Our ability to compete in these markets will depend in significant part upon our ability to successfully develop, introduce and sell new and enhanced products on a timely and cost-effective basis, and to respond to changing customer requirements. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, delays in the development and introduction of new products. These delays would provide a competitor a first-to-market opportunity and allow a competitor to achieve greater market share. Once a customer designs a competitors product into its product offering, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products to that customer because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk for the customer. Our product development is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in technology, anticipate the adoption of new standards, coordinate our technical personnel, and identify and eliminate design flaws. Defects or errors found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments could result in delays in market acceptance of these products. New products, even if first introduced by us, may not gain market acceptance or result in future profitability. Lack of market acceptance for our new products will jeopardize our ability to recoup research and development expenditures, hurt our reputation and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, after we have developed a new product, our customers will usually test and evaluate our products. Our customers may need three or more months to test, evaluate and adopt our products and an additional three or more months to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our products. Even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment, we have no assurance that the customer will ultimately bring its product to market or that such effort by our customer will be successful. We may also seek to develop products with new standards for our industry. It will take time for these new standards and products to be adopted, for customers to accept and transition to these new products and for significant sales to be generated from them, if this happens at all. Moreover, broad acceptance of new standards or products by customers may reduce demand for our older products. If this decreased demand is not offset by increased demand for our new products, our results of operations could be harmed. We cannot assure you that any new products or standards we develop will be commercially successful. We may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position because of the intense competition in the memory industry. We conduct business in an industry characterized by intense competition, rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, declining average sales prices and rapid product obsolescence. Our primary competitors for storage products include: Intel, Samsung, SanDisk, Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital; and for DRAM products include: Micron, Qimonda, and SMART Modular. Our competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, broader product lines, lower cost structures, greater brand recognition and longer-standing relationships with customers and suppliers. As a result, our competitors may be in a better position to influence or respond to new or emerging technologies or standards and to changes in customer requirements than us. Our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, and may be able to deliver competitive products at a lower price. 11 Table of Contents In addition, some of our significant suppliers, including Micron, Qimonda and Samsung Semiconductor, are also our competitors, many of whom have the ability to manufacture competitive products at lower costs as a result of their higher levels of integration. We also face competition from current and prospective customers that evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally. Competition may arise from new and emerging companies or due to the development of cooperative relationships among our current and potential competitors or third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers. We expect our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their current products, reduce their prices and introduce new products that may offer greater performance, improved pricing or render our technology or products obsolete or uncompetitive, any of which could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our products. Our stock price is likely to be volatile and could drop unexpectedly. Our common stock has been publicly traded since September 2000. The market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations since the date of our initial public offering. The stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities, particularly securities of technology companies. As a result, the market price of our common stock may materially decline, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type is often expensive and diverts managements attention and resources. Our efforts to expand our business internationally may not be successful and may expose us to additional risks that may not exist in the United States, which in turn could cause our business and operating results to suffer. We sell our products to customers in foreign countries and seek to increase our level of international business activity through the expansion of our operations into select international markets, including Asia and Europe. Such strategy may include opening sales offices in foreign countries, the outsourcing of manufacturing operations to third party contract manufacturers, establishing joint ventures with foreign partners, and the establishment of manufacturing operations in foreign countries. In January 2008, we completed the construction of our 210,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Malaysia that is expected, over time, to serve as a major hub for our international operational activities including manufacturing, sales and marketing, procurement, and logistics. A failure to successfully and timely integrate these operations into our global infrastructure will have a negative impact on our overall operations, cause us to delay or forego some of the original perceived benefits of operating internationally such as lower average production and engineering labor costs, better access to growing markets in Asia, improved supply chain efficiency, reduced lead times, increased manufacturing efficiency through investments in new state-of-the-art equipment and a lower overall long-term effective tax rate. Establishing operations in a foreign country or region presents numerous risks, including:  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing operations in certain foreign countries;  foreign laws and regulations, which may vary country by country, may impact how we conduct our business;  higher costs of doing business in certain foreign countries, including different employment laws;  difficulty protecting our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or infringement;  political or economic instability;  changes in import/export duties;  necessity of obtaining government approvals;  trade restrictions;  work stoppages or other changes in labor conditions;  difficulties in collecting of accounts receivables on a timely basis or at all;  taxes;  longer payment cycles and foreign currency fluctuations; and  seasonal reductions in business activity in some parts of the world, such as Europe. In addition, changes in policies and/or laws of the United States or foreign governments resulting in, among other things, higher taxation, currency conversion limitations, restrictions on fund transfers or the expropriation of private enterprises, could reduce the anticipated benefits of our international expansion. We may also encounter potential adverse tax consequences if taxing authorities in different jurisdictions worldwide disagree with our interpretation of various tax laws or our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions, which could result in our paying additional taxes, interest and penalties. Furthermore, any actions by countries in which we conduct business to reverse policies that encourage foreign trade or investment could adversely affect our business. If we fail to realize the anticipated revenue growth of our future international operations, our business and operating results could suffer. 12 Table of Contents We expect that our strategy to expand our international operations will require the expenditure of significant resources and involve the efforts and attention of our management. Unlike some of our competitors, we have limited experience operating our business in foreign countries. Some of our competitors may have substantial advantage over us in attracting customers in certain foreign countries due to earlier established operations in that country, greater knowledge with respect to cultural differences of customers residing in that country and greater brand recognition and longer-standing relationships with customers in that country. If our international expansion efforts in any foreign country are unsuccessful, we may decide to cease these foreign operations, which would likely harm our reputation and cause us to incur expenses and losses. We are involved from time to time in claims and litigation over intellectual property rights, which may adversely affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. We believe that it may be necessary, from time to time, to initiate litigation against one or more third parties to preserve our intellectual property rights. Some of our suppliers and licensors have generally agreed to provide us with various levels of intellectual property indemnification for products and technology we purchase or license from them. A third-party could claim that our products infringe a patent or other proprietary right. In addition, from time to time, we have received, and may continue to receive in the future, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights. Any of the foregoing events or claims could result in litigation. Such litigation, whether as plaintiff or defendant, would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is ultimately determined in our favor. In the event of an adverse result in such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of certain products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to use the infringed technology. In addition, our suppliers and licensors obligation to indemnify us for intellectual property infringement may be insufficient or inapplicable to any such litigation. A license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our failure to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could cause us to incur substantial costs and suspend manufacturing products using the infringed technology. If we obtain a license, we would likely be required to pay license fees or make royalty payments for sales under the license. Such payments would increase our costs of revenues and reduce our gross margins and gross profit. If we are unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology, we could incur substantial liabilities or be required to expend substantial resources redesigning our products to eliminate the infringement. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in redesigning our products or that we could obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Product development or license negotiating would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Our indemnification obligations for the infringement by our products of the intellectual property rights of others could require us to pay substantial damages. As is common in the industry, we currently have in effect a number of agreements in which we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our customers and suppliers from damages and costs which may arise from the infringement by our products of third-party patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights. The scope of such indemnity varies, but may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorneys fees. Our insurance does not cover intellectual property infringement. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. We may periodically have to respond to claims and litigate these types of indemnification obligations. Any such indemnification claims could require us to pay substantial damages that may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our indemnification obligations to our customers and suppliers for product defects could require us to pay substantial damages. A number of our product sales and product purchase agreements provide that we will defend, indemnify and hold harmless our customers and suppliers from damages and costs which may arise from product warranty claims or claims for injury or damage resulting from defects in our products. We maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all or any part of the claims asserted against us. A successful claim brought against us that is in excess of, or excluded from, our insurance coverage could substantially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 13 Table of Contents Our intellectual property may not be adequately protected, which could harm our competitive position. Our intellectual property is critical to our success. We protect our intellectual property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements. It is possible that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not:  Prevent the challenge, invalidation or circumvention of our existing patents;  Result in patents that lead to commercially viable products or provide competitive advantages for our products;  Prevent our competitors from independently developing similar products, duplicating our products or designing around the patents owned by us;  Prevent third-party patents from having an adverse effect on our ability to do business;  Provide adequate protection for our intellectual property rights;  Prevent disputes with third parties regarding ownership of our intellectual property rights;  Prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and know-how to third parties or into the public domain; and  Result in patents from any of our pending applications. In addition, despite our efforts to protect or intellectual property rights and confidential information, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and make unauthorized use of our technologies or independently develop similar technologies. In addition, if any of our patents are challenged and found to be invalid, our ability to exclude competitors from making, using or selling the same or similar products related to such patents would cease. We have on at least one occasion applied for and may in the future apply for patent protection in foreign countries. The laws of foreign countries, however, may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. Many U.S. companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in foreign countries. Because we sell some of our products overseas, we have exposure to foreign intellectual property risks. Declines in our average sales prices may result in declines in our revenues and gross profit. Our industry is competitive and characterized by historical declines in average sales prices. Our average sales prices may decline due to several factors, including overcapacity in the worldwide supply of DRAM and Flash memory component as a result of increased manufacturing efficiencies, new manufacturing processes and manufacturing capacity expansions by component suppliers. In the past, overcapacity has resulted in significant declines in component prices, which has negatively impacted our average sales prices, revenues and gross profit. In addition, our competitors and customers also impose significant pricing pressures on us. Since a large percentage of our sales are to a small number of customers that are primarily distributors and large OEMs, these customers have exerted, and we expect they will continue to exert, pressure on us to make price concessions. If not offset by increases in demand for our products, decreases in average sales prices would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and any future downturn could adversely affect our business. The semiconductor industry, including the memory markets in which we compete, is highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The industry has experienced significant downturns often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies and their customers products and declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average sales prices. Prior downturns in the semiconductor industry negatively impacted our average sales prices, revenues and earnings. Any future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations. On July 30, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement for a $35 million revolving credit facility. Our debt could have important consequences, such as:  requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other cash requirements;  increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in, our business and industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; and  limiting our ability to incur additional debt on acceptable terms, if at all. 14 Table of Contents Additionally, if we were to default under our credit agreement and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default, interest on the obligations would accrue at an increased rate and the lenders could accelerate our obligations under the credit agreement; however that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default. Additionally, to the extent we have made intercompany loans to our subsidiaries that have required us to pledge such loans to the lenders under the credit agreement, our subsidiaries would be required to pay the amount of the intercompany loans to the lenders in the event we are in default under the credit agreement. Any actions taken by the lenders against us in the event we are in default under the credit agreement could harm our financial condition. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a negative market reaction. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we undertake a thorough examination of our internal control systems and procedures for financial reporting. We also are required to completely document and test those systems. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports. Section 404, as updated, also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to annually attest to, and report on, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Although our management has determined, and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested, that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008, we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting is not considered adequate, we may experience a loss of public confidence, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price. Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations and Nasdaq rules, have required most public companies, including us, to devote additional internal and external resources to various governance and compliance matters. Because we have a relatively small corporate staff, we have incurred significant costs on outside professional advisers to assist us with these efforts. These costs have included increased accounting related fees associated with preparing the attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, these new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, as well as modifications by the government and Nasdaq. The way in which they are applied and implemented may change over time, which could result in even higher costs to address and implement revisions to compliance (including disclosure) and governance practices. We intend to invest the necessary resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may be harmed and we will be required to incur additional expenses. We may make acquisitions that are dilutive to existing shareholders, result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. We intend to grow our business through business combinations or other acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute our shareholders percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, reduce our cash reserves or assume contingent liabilities. Furthermore, acquisitions may require material infrequent charges and could result in adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, deferred compensation charges, in-process research and development charges, the amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation and identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations. Our limited experience in acquiring other businesses, product lines and technologies may make it difficult for us to overcome problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions we may undertake. We continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise, including business combinations, strategic partnerships, capital investments and the purchase, licensing or sale of assets. Our experience in acquiring other businesses, product lines and technologies is limited. The attention of our small management team may be diverted from our core business if we undertake any future acquisitions. Any potential future acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:  Problems and delays in successfully assimilating and integrating the purchased operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems; 15 Table of Contents  Unanticipated costs and expenditures associated with the acquisition, including any need to infuse significant capital into the acquired operations;  Adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, customers and strategic partners;  Risks associated with entering markets and foreign countries in which we have no or limited prior experience;  Contractual, intellectual property or employment issues;  Potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations; and  Potential litigation arising from the acquired companys operations before the acquisition. These risks could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, harm our reputation and increase our expenses. Our inability to overcome problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions could divert the attention of management, utilize scarce corporate resources and otherwise harm our business. These challenges are magnified as the size of an acquisition increases, and we cannot assure you that we will realize the intended benefits of any acquisition. For example, in June 2004 we discontinued the operation of our Xiran Division, which was formed in 2002 as a result of our acquisition of technology for networked storage applications. We were unable to successfully bring the Xiran Division products to market after funding its operations for over two years. In connection with the discontinued operation, we recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2004. We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed. Even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms or realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions we do undertake. Three of our beneficial shareholders have substantial influence over our operations and could control all matters requiring shareholder approval. Our founders, Manouch Moshayedi, Mike Moshayedi and Mark Moshayedi, are brothers and beneficially own approximately 52% of our outstanding common stock at December 31, 2008 (assuming the inclusion of shares of common stock subject to options that are presently exercisable or will become exercisable within 60 days of such date). In addition, Manouch Moshayedi and Mark Moshayedi are executive officers and directors. As a result, they potentially have the ability to control or influence all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election and removal of directors, approval of significant corporate transactions and the decision of whether a change in control will occur. This potential control could affect the price that certain investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. We face risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, including foreign currency fluctuations and trade barriers, that could lead to a decrease in demand for our products or an increase in the cost of the components used in our products. The volatility of general economic conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect the prices of our products and the prices of the components used in our products. International sales, which are derived from billings to foreign customers, accounted for 26.3%, 19.5% and 12.7% of our revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. No foreign geographic area or single foreign country accounted for more than 10.0% of our revenues in 2008, 2007 or 2006. For 2008, 2007 and 2006, more than 95.0% of our international sales were denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country, the prices of our products will increase relative to that countrys currency and our products may be less competitive in that country. In addition, we cannot be sure that our international customers will continue to be willing to place orders denominated in U.S. dollars. If they do not, our revenues and results of operations will be subject to foreign exchange fluctuations, which could harm our business. We do not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risks. We purchase a majority of the DRAM and Flash components used in our products from local distributors of foreign suppliers. Although our purchases of DRAM and Flash components are currently denominated in U.S. dollars, devaluation of the U.S. dollar relative to the currency of a foreign supplier would likely result in an increase in our cost of DRAM and Flash components. Our international sales are subject to other risks, including regulatory risks, tariffs and other trade barriers, timing and availability of export licenses, political and economic instability, difficulties in accounts receivable collections, difficulties in managing distributors, lack of a significant local sales presence, difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals, compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties and potentially adverse tax consequences. In addition, the United States or foreign countries may implement quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products, leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country. 16 Table of Contents The manufacturing of our products is complex and subject to yield problems, which could decrease available supply and increase costs. The manufacture of our Flash memory products, stacked DRAM products and Flash controllers is a complex process, and it is often difficult for companies to achieve acceptable product yields. Reduced yields could decrease available supply and increase costs. Flash controller yields depend on both our product design and the manufacturing process technology unique to our semiconductor foundry partners. Because low yields may result from either design defects or process difficulties, we may not identify yield problems until well into the production cycle, when an actual product defect exists and can be analyzed and tested. In addition, many of these yield problems are difficult to diagnose and time consuming or expensive to remedy. 17 Table of Contents The execution of our growth strategy depends on our ability to retain key personnel, including our executive officers, and to attract qualified personnel. Competition for employees in our industry is intense. We have had and may continue to have difficulty hiring the necessary engineering, sales and marketing and management personnel to support our growth. The successful implementation of our business model and growth strategy depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key research and development, sales and marketing and operations personnel, including Manouch Moshayedi, our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Moshayedi, our President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Technical Officer and Secretary, and Raymond Cook, our Chief Financial Officer. The loss of any key employee, the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or the inability of our officers and key employees to expand, train and manage our employee base would prevent us from executing our growth strategy. In addition, on February 4, 2009, we commenced a reduction of our workforce at our Santa Ana, California headquarters as part of the transition of certain of our operations to our new 210,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia. While this action may help us achieve our growth strategy, it may negatively impact employee morale and our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees. Our inability to attract and retain additional key employees could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business. Our business is subject to regulation by various federal and state governmental agencies. Such regulation includes employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, import/export controls and tax. We are also subject to regulation in other countries where we conduct business. In certain jurisdictions, such regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. These enforcement actions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of managements attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. 18 Table of Contents In addition from time to time we have received, and expect to continue to receive, correspondence from former employees terminated by us who threaten to bring claims against us alleging that we have violated one or more labor and employment regulations. In certain of these instances the former employee has brought claims against us and we expect that we will encounter similar actions against us in the future. An adverse outcome in any such litigation could require us to pay contractual damages, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys fees and costs. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and stock option plan could prevent or delay a change in control and, as a result, negatively impact our shareholders. We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover attempt. For example, provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions also could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include:  limitations on who may call special meetings of shareholders;  advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings;  elimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors;  the right of a majority of directors in office to fill vacancies on the board of directors;  the ability of our board of directors to issue, without shareholder approval, blank check preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt. Provisions of our 2000 Stock Incentive Plan allow for the automatic vesting of all outstanding equity awards granted under the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan upon a change in control under certain circumstances. Such provisions may have the effect of discouraging a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
