Item 1A. Risk Factors." We continue to sell MTBE for use as a gasoline additive, substantially all of which is sold for use outside the U.S. See "Manufacturing and Operations" below and "Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Sales and Marketing We manage a global work force which sells our polyurethane chemicals to over 3,000 customers in more than 90 countries. Our sales and technical resources are organized to support major regional markets, as well as key end-use markets which require a more global approach. These key end-use markets include the appliance, automotive, footwear, furniture and coatings, construction products, adhesives, sealants and elastomers industries. We provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components (i.e., the isocyanate or the polyol) or in the form of "systems" in which we provide the total isocyanate and polyol formulation to 8 Table of Contents our customers in ready-to-use form. Our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support tailored to meet our customer's needs is critical to our long term success. We have strategically located our polyurethane formulation facilities, commonly referred to in the chemicals industry as "systems houses," close to our customers, enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service. We believe this customer support and technical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers. We manufacture polyols primarily to support our MDI customers' requirements. We believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts, in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships, have facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long-term customer supply positions. Due to the specialized nature of our markets, our sales force must possess technical knowledge of our products and their applications. Our strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by providing innovative solutions, quality products, reliable supply, competitive prices and superior customer service. Manufacturing and Operations Our MDI production facilities are located in Geismar, Louisiana, Rozenburg, Netherlands and, through our joint ventures, Shanghai, China. These facilities receive aniline, which is a primary material used in the production of MDI, from our facilities located in Geismar, Louisiana; Wilton, U.K.; and Shanghai, China. We believe that this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities provide a significant competitive advantage over other producers. In addition to reducing transportation costs for our raw materials, integration helps reduce our exposure to cyclical prices. The following table sets forth the annual production capacity of polyurethane chemicals at each of our polyurethanes facilities: MDI Polyols TPU Aniline Nitrobenzene PO PG MTBE (millions of pounds) (millions of gallons) Geismar, Louisiana 970 160 715 (2) 953 (2) Osnabrück, Germany 26 57 Port Neches, Texas 525 145 260 Ringwood, Illinois 18 Caojing, China 250 (1) Rozenburg, Netherlands 880 130 Wilton, U.K. 715 953 Total 2,100 316 75 1,430 1,906 525 145 260 (1)Represents our 50% share of capacity from SLIC, our unconsolidated Chinese joint venture. (2)Represents our approximately 78% share of capacity under our Rubicon LLC manufacturing joint venture with Chemtura Corporation. At both our Geismar and Rozenburg facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce our MDI. This technology, which is also used in our Chinese joint venture, contributes to our position as a low cost MDI producer. In addition to MDI, we use a proprietary manufacturing process to manufacture PO. We own or license all technology and know-how developed and utilized at our PO facility. Our process combines isobutane and oxygen in proprietary oxidation (peroxidation) reactors, thereby forming TBHP and TBA, which are further processed into PO and MTBE, respectively. Because our PO production process is less expensive relative to other technologies and allows all of our PO co-products to be processed into saleable or useable materials, we believe that our PO production technology possesses several distinct advantages over its alternatives. 9 Table of Contents We operate polyurethane systems houses in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Deerpark, Australia; Shanghai, China; Cartagena, Colombia; Deggendorf, Germany; Thane (Maharashtra), India; Ternate, Italy; Tlalnepantla, Mexico; Mississauga, Ontario; Kuan Yin, Taiwan; Samuprakam, Thailand; Osnabrück, Germany and Dammam, Saudi Arabia. Joint Ventures Rubicon Joint Venture. We and Chemtura Corporation own Rubicon LLC, which owns aniline, nitrobenzene and DPA manufacturing facilities in Geismar, Louisiana. We are entitled to approximately 78% of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of Rubicon LLC, and Chemtura Corporation is entitled to 100% of the DPA production. In addition to operating the joint venture's owned aniline, nitrobenzene and DPA facilities, Rubicon LLC also operates our wholly owned MDI and polyol facilities at Geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire Geismar complex. As a result of this joint venture, we are able to achieve greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain. Rubicon LLC is consolidated in our financial statements. Chinese MDI Joint Ventures. In January 2003, we entered into two related joint venture agreements to build MDI production facilities near Shanghai, China. SLIC, our manufacturing joint venture with BASF AG and three Chinese chemical companies, built three plants that manufacture MNB, aniline and crude MDI. We effectively own 35% of SLIC and it is our unconsolidated affiliate. HPS, our splitting joint venture with Shanghai Chlor-Alkali Chemical Company, Ltd, has constructed a plant to manufacture pure MDI, polymeric MDI and MDI variants. We own 70% of HPS and it is our consolidated affiliate. These projects have been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners and borrowed funds. SLIC and HPS commenced operations during 2006. The total production capacity of the SLIC facilities is 530 million pounds per year of MDI and the production capacity of the HPS facility is 270 million pounds per year of MDI finished products. Russia MDI Coatings and Systems Joint Venture. In 2006, we purchased a 45% interest in NMG, a leading Polyurethanes company headquartered in Obninsk, Russia. This joint venture, now Huntsman NMG, manufactures and markets a range of polyurethane systems in adhesives, coatings, elastomers and insulation using Huntsman MDI Products. Raw Materials The primary raw materials for MDI-based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and PO. Benzene is a widely available commodity that is the primary feedstock for the production of MDI and aniline. Historically, benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs. We purchase benzene from third parties to manufacture nitrobenzene and aniline, almost all of which we then use to produce MDI. A major cost in the production of polyols is attributable to the costs of PO. The integration of our PO business with our polyurethane chemicals business gives us access to a competitively priced, strategic source of PO and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of MDI products. The primary raw materials used in our PO production process are butane/isobutane, propylene, methanol and oxygen, which accounted for 58%, 29%, 11% and 2%, respectively, of total raw material costs in 2009. We purchase our raw materials primarily under long-term contracts. While most of these feedstocks are commodity materials generally available to us from a wide variety of suppliers at competitive prices in the spot market, all the propylene used in the production of our PO is produced internally and delivered through a pipeline connected to our PO facility. 10 Table of Contents Competition Our major competitors in the polyurethane chemicals market include BASF, Bayer, Dow, Yantai Wanhua and LyondellBasell. While these competitors and others produce various types and quantities of polyurethane chemicals, we focus on MDI and MDI-based polyurethane systems. Our polyurethane chemicals business competes in two basic ways: (1) where price is the dominant element of competition, our polyurethane chemicals business differentiates itself by its high level of customer support, including cooperation on technical and safety matters; and (2) elsewhere, we compete on the basis of product performance and our ability to react quickly to changing customer needs and by providing customers with innovative solutions to their needs. The market in which our Polyurethanes segment operates is highly competitive. Among our competitors in this market are some of the world's largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources. Some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can. In addition, some of our competitors in this market have greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. If any of our current or future competitors in this market develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. Advanced Materials General Our Advanced Materials segment is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of technologically advanced epoxy, acrylic and polyurethane-based polymer products. We focus on formulations and systems that are used to address customer-specific needs in a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications. Our products are used either as replacements for traditional materials or in applications where traditional materials do not meet demanding engineering specifications. For example, structural adhesives are used to replace metal rivets and advanced composites are used to replace traditional aluminum panels in the manufacture of aerospace components. Our Advanced Materials segment is characterized by the breadth of our product offering, our expertise in complex chemistry, our long-standing relationships with our customers, our ability to develop and adapt our technology and our applications expertise for new markets and new applications.

Products and Markets Our product range spans from basic liquid and solid resins, to specialty components like curing agents, matting agents, accelerators, cross-linkers, reactive diluents, thermoplastic polyamides and additives. In addition to these components, which we typically sell to formulators in various industries, we also produce and sell ready to use formulated polymer systems. Base Resins and Specialty Component Markets. Our products are used for the protection of steel and concrete substrates, such as flooring, metal furniture and appliances, buildings, linings for storage tanks and food and beverage cans, and the primer coat of automobile bodies and ships. Epoxy-based 11 Table of Contents surface coatings are among the most widely used industrial coatings due to their structural stability and broad application functionality combined with overall economic efficiency. Base resins and specialty components are also used for composite applications. A structural composite is made by combining two or more different materials, such as fibers, resins and other specialty additives, to create a product with enhanced structural properties. Specifically, structural composites are lightweight, high-strength, rigid materials with high resistance to chemicals, moisture and high temperatures. Our product range comprises basic and advanced epoxy resins, curing agents and other advanced chemicals, additives and formulated polymer systems. The four key target markets for our structural composites are aerospace, windmill blades for wind power generation, general industrial and automotive applications, and recreational products (mainly sports equipment such as skis). Structural composites continue to substitute for traditional materials, such as metals and wood, in a wide variety of applications due to their light weight, strength and durability. Formulated Systems. The structural adhesives market requires high-strength "engineering" adhesives for use in the manufacture and repair of items to bond various engineering substrates. Our business focus is on engineering adhesives based on epoxy, polyurethane, acrylic and other technologies which are used to bond materials, such as steel, aluminum, engineering plastics and composites in substitution of traditional joining techniques. Our Araldite® brand name has considerable value in the industrial and consumer adhesives markets. In many countries, Araldite® branded products are known as high-performance adhesives, and we generally believe that this is the value-added segment of the market where recognition of our long-standing Araldite® brand is a key competitive advantage. Packaging is a key characteristic of our adhesives products. Our range of adhesives is sold in a variety of packs and sizes, specifically targeted to three specific end-markets and sold through specifically targeted routes to market: General Industrial Bonding. We sell a broad range of advanced formulated adhesives to a broad base of small-to medium-sized customers, including specialist distributors. Industry Specific. We sell our adhesive products on a global basis into diverse, industry-specific markets, which include the aerospace, wind turbine, DVD, LNG transport, filterbonding, solar cell and other industrial applications markets. Our target markets are chosen because we believe it is worthwhile to utilize our direct sales force and applications experts to tailor products and services to suit the needs and performance specifications of the specific market segments. Consumer/DIY. We package and sell consumer adhesives through strategic distribution arrangements with a number of the major marketers of consumer/DIY adhesives, such as Bostik and Shelleys. These products are sold globally through a number of major retail outlets, often under the Araldite® brand name. Our electrical materials are formulated polymer systems, which make up the insulation materials used in equipment for the generation, transmission and distribution of electrical power, such as transformers, switch gears, ignition coils, sensors, motors and magnets, and for the protection of electrical and electronic devices and components. The purpose of these products is to insulate, protect or shield either the environment from electrical current or electrical devices from the environment, such as temperature or humidity. Our electrical insulating materials target two key market segments: the heavy electrical equipment market and the light electrical equipment market. Products for the heavy electrical equipment market segment are used in power plant components, devices for power grids and insulating parts and components. In addition, there are numerous devices, such as motors and magnetic coils used in trains and medical equipment, which are manufactured using epoxy and related technologies. Products for the light electrical equipment market segment are used in applications such as industrial automation and control, consumer electronics, car electronics and electrical components. The end customers in the electrical insulating materials market encompass the 12 Table of Contents relevant original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") as well as numerous manufacturers of components used in the final products. We also develop, manufacture and market materials used in the production of printed circuit boards. Our products are ultimately used in industries ranging from telecommunications and personal computer mother board manufacture to automotive electronic systems manufacture. Soldermasks are our most important product line in printed circuit board technologies, particularly in Europe. Sales are made mainly under the Probimer®, Probimage®, and Probelec® trademarks. Our Probimer® trademark is a widely recognized brand name for soldermasks. We produce mainly polyurethane-based and epoxy formulated polymer systems used in the production of models, prototypes, patterns, molds and a variety of related products for design, prototyping and short-run manufacture. Our products are used extensively in the automotive, aerospace and industrial markets as productivity tools to quickly and efficiently create accurate prototypes and develop experimental models, and to lower the cost of manufacturing items in limited quantities primarily using computer-aided-design techniques. We separate the overall tooling and modeling materials market into two distinct groupsstandard tooling and modeling materials and stereolithography technology. Our standard tooling and modeling materials are polymer-based materials used by craftsmen to make the traditional patterns, molds, models, jigs and fixtures required by the foundry, automotive, ceramics and other such industries. Stereolithography is a technology that is used to accurately produce physical three-dimensional models directly from computer-aided-design data without cutting, machining or tooling. The models are produced by selectively curing a light-sensitive liquid resin with a laser beam. We sell our stereolithography products to customers in the aerospace, appliance, automotive, consumer, electronics and medical markets. Sales and Marketing We maintain multiple routes to market to service our diverse customer base. These routes to market range from using our own direct sales force for targeted, technically-oriented distribution to mass general distribution. Our direct sales force focuses on engineering solutions decision-makers at major customers who purchase significant amounts of product from us. We use technically-oriented specialist distributors to augment our sales effort in niche markets and applications where we do not believe it is appropriate to develop direct sales resources. We use mass general distribution channels to sell our products into a wide range of general applications where technical expertise is less important to the user of the products to reduce our overall selling expenses. We believe our use of multiple routes to market enables us to reach a broader customer base at an efficient cost. We conduct sales activities through dedicated regional sales teams in the Americas; Europe, Africa and the Middle East ("EAME"); and Asia. Our global customers are covered by key account managers who are familiar with the specific requirements of these clients. The management of long-standing customer relationships, some of which are 20 to 30 years old, is at the heart of the sales and marketing process. We are also supported by a strong network of distributors. We serve a highly fragmented customer base. For our consumer adhesives, we have entered into exclusive branding and distribution arrangements with, for example, Bostik in Europe and Shelleys in Australia. Under these arrangements, our distribution partners fund advertising and sales promotions, negotiate and sell to major retail chains, own inventories and provide store deliveries (and sometimes shelf merchandising) in exchange for a reliable, high-quality supply of Araldite® branded, ready-to-sell packaged products. Manufacturing and Operations We are a global business serving customers in three principal geographic regions: EAME, the Americas, and Asia. To service our customers efficiently, we maintain manufacturing plants around the 13 Table of Contents world with a strategy of global, regional and local manufacturing employed to optimize the level of service and minimize the cost to our customers. The following table summarizes the plants that we operate: Location Description of Facility Bad Saeckingen, Germany(1) Formulating Facility Bergkamen, Germany Synthesis Facility Chennai, India(2) Resins and Synthesis Facility Duxford, U.K. Formulating Facility East Lansing, Michigan, U.S. Formulating Facility Istanbul, Turkey(1) Formulating Facility Los Angeles, California, U.S. Formulating Facility McIntosh, Alabama, U.S. Resins and Synthesis Facility Monthey, Switzerland Resins and Synthesis Facility Pamplona, Spain Resins and Synthesis Facility Panyu, China(1)(3) Formulation and Synthesis Facility Sadat City, Egypt Formulating Facility Taboão da Serra, Brazil Formulating Facility (1)Leased land and/or building.

Our facilities in Asia are well-positioned to take advantage of the market growth that is expected in this region. Furthermore, we believe that we are the largest producer of epoxy resin compounds in India. Raw Materials The principal raw materials we purchase for the manufacture of basic and advanced epoxy resins are epichlorohydrin, bisphenol A and BLR. We also purchase amines, polyols, isocyanates, acrylic materials, hardeners and fillers for the production of our formulated polymer systems and complex chemicals and additives. Raw material costs constitute a sizeable percentage of sales for certain applications. We have supply contracts with a number of suppliers. The terms of our supply contracts vary, but, in general, these contracts contain provisions that set forth the quantities of product to be supplied and purchased and formula-based pricing. Additionally, we produce some of our most important raw materials, such as BLR and its basic derivatives, which are the basic building blocks of many of our products. We are the fourth largest producer of BLR in the world. Approximately 50% of the BLR we produce is consumed in the production of our formulated polymer systems. The balance of our BLR is sold as liquid or solid resin in the merchant market, allowing us to increase the utilization of our production plants and lower our overall BLR production cost. We believe that manufacturing a substantial proportion of our principal raw material gives us a competitive advantage over other epoxy-based polymer systems formulators, 14 Table of Contents most of whom must buy BLR from third-party suppliers. This position helps protect us from pricing pressure from BLR suppliers and aids in providing us a stable supply of BLR in difficult market conditions. We consume certain amines produced by our Performance Products segment and isocyanates produced by our Polyurethanes segment, which we use to formulate Advanced Materials products. Competition The market in which our Advanced Materials segment operates is highly competitive, and is dependent on significant capital investment, the development of proprietary technology, and maintenance of product research and development. Among our competitors in this market are some of the world's largest chemical companies and major integrated companies that have their own raw material resources.

Our Textile Effects segment is characterized by the breadth of our product offering, our long-standing relationships with our customers, our ability to develop and adapt our technology and our applications expertise for new markets and new applications. 15 Table of Contents We operate synthesis, formulating and production facilities in North America, Europe, Asia and South America. We market multiple products to customers in multiple end-markets, including the following: consumer fashion apparel, sportswear, career and uniform apparel, military, automotive, home textiles and furnishings, carpet and other functional textiles. In December 2008, we announced restructuring programs for our Textile Effects segment. These restructuring programs were necessary to allow our Textile Effects segment to adapt to the dynamic business shifts that have occurred in the textile market. During 2009, we have spent approximately $46 million to significantly expand resources and capacity in Asia, while refocusing and consolidating resources in Europe and North America and to transition from a regional to a global, market-focused organization. Other elements of our plan include simplifying global distribution networks, enhancing research and development activities and continuing investments in EH&S projects to ensure that all of our acquired manufacturing units are operating in accordance with our standards. We expect to spend approximately $60 million over approximately the next year to complete these projects. We have targeted approximately $100 million in annual savings when all phases of the restructuring are fully completed. Products and Markets Textiles generally involve a complex matrix of fibers, effects and functionality, and the resulting products range from fashion apparel to bulletproof vests, home linens to air and water filters, and upholstery to automotive interiors. Our broad range of dyestuffs and chemicals enhance both the aesthetic appearance of these products and the functionality needed to ensure that they perform in their end-use markets. Since the requirements for these markets vary dramatically, our business strategy focuses on the two major marketsapparel and technical textiles. We work to provide the right balance of products and service to meet the technical challenges in each of these markets. The apparel market, which also includes our home interiors products, focuses on products that provide an aesthetic effect and/or improve the processing efficiency within the textile mill. We offer a complete range of colors for cotton, polyester and nylon that cover the range of shades needed for sportswear, intimate apparel, towels, sheeting and casual wear. Our dyes have been developed to ensure that they offer the highest levels of wash fastness currently available in the market. Optical brighteners and other pretreatment products provide "bright white" effects for apparel, towels and sheeting. Pretreatment and dyeing auxiliaries ensure that these fabrics are processed efficiently and effectivelycleaning the fabrics with fewer chemicals, less energy and less water and thereby minimizing the environmental footprint and reducing the processing costs. Silicone softeners may be used to enhance the feel of products. Technical textiles include automotive textiles, carpet, military fabrics, mattress ticking and nonwoven and other technical fabrics. Though the product groups may differ in their end-uses, the articles must provide a high-level of functionality and performance in their respective markets. High-lightfast dyes and UV absorbers are used in automotive interiors and outdoor furnishings to provide colors that don't fade when exposed to sunlight and heat. Powerful stain repellent and release technology imparts durable protection for upholstery, military and medical fabrics, without affecting the color, breathability or feel of the fabric. Specialized dyes and prints create unique camouflage patterns for military uniforms, backpacks and tarps that won't fade through wash and wear or during exposure to the elements. Sales and Marketing For our textile effects products, we focus on providing effect competence and process competence to our customers. Effect competencedelivering value-added effects to our customer's productsenables us to capitalize on new and innovative technologies and to assist our customers in their efforts 16 Table of Contents to differentiate themselves from competitors. Process competenceapplying know-how and expertise to improve customers' processesallows us to utilize our technical service to reduce cost and enhance efficiency. Manufacturing and Operations We are a global business serving customers in three principal geographic regions: EAME, the Americas, and Asia. To service our customers efficiently, we maintain manufacturing plants around the world with a strategy of global, regional and local manufacturing employed to optimize the level of service and minimize the cost to our customers.

We also have the capacity to produce approximately 945 million pounds of EG annually at our facilities in Botany, Australia and Port Neches, Texas. Products and Markets Performance Specialties. The following table shows the end-market applications for our performance specialties products: Product Group Applications Specialty Amines liquid soaps, personal care, lubricant and fuel additives, polyurethane foams, fabric softeners, paints and coatings, refinery processing, water treating Polyetheramines polyurethane foams and insulation, construction and flooring, paints and coatings, lubricant and fuel additives, adhesives, epoxy composites, agrochemicals, oilfield chemicals, printing inks, pigment dispersion Ethyleneamines lubricant and fuel additives, epoxy hardeners, wet strength resins, chelating agents, fungicides Morpholine/DGA® agent and Gas Treating hydrocarbon processing, construction chemicals, synthetic rubber, water treating, electronics applications, gas treatment and agriculture Carbonates lubricant and fuel additives, agriculture, electronics applications, textile treatment, solar panels Specialty Surfactants agricultural herbicides, construction, paper de-inking, lubricants 19 Table of Contents Our performance specialties products are organized around the following end markets: coatings, polymers and resins; process additives; resources, fuels and lubricants; and agrochemicals. Amines. Amines broadly refers to the family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia with various ethylene and propylene derivatives. Generally, amines are valued for their properties as a reactive, emulsifying, dispersant, detergent, solvent or corrosion inhibiting agent. Growth in demand for amines is highly correlated with GDP growth due to its strong links to general industrial and consumer products markets. However, certain segments of the amines market, such as polyetheramines, have grown at rates well in excess of GDP growth due to new product development, technical innovation, and substitution and replacement of competing products. For example, polyetheramines are used by customers who demand increasingly sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations, enabling the customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing materials. As amines are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer-specific end-use application, pricing does not generally fluctuate with movements in underlying raw materials. Morpholine/DGA® Agent. Morpholine and DGA® agent are produced as co-products by reacting ammonia with DEG. Morpholine is used in a number of niche industrial applications including rubber curing (as an accelerator) and flocculants for water treatment. DGA® agent is primarily used in gas treating, electronics, herbicides and metalworking end-use applications. Carbonates. Ethylene and propylene carbonates are manufactured by reacting EO and PO with carbon dioxide. Carbonates are used as solvents and as reactive diluents in polymer and coating applications. They are also increasingly being used as a photo-resist solvent in the manufacture of printed circuit boards, solar panels, LCD screens and the production of lithium batteries. Also, propylene carbonates have recently received approval by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use as a solvent in certain agricultural applications. We expect these solvents to replace traditional aromatic solvents that are increasingly subject to legislative restrictions and prohibitions. 20 Table of Contents Performance Intermediates. The following table sets forth the end markets for our performance intermediates products: Product Group End Markets Surfactants Alkoxylates household detergents, industrial cleaners, anti-fog chemicals for glass, asphalt emulsions, shampoos, polymerization additives, de-emulsifiers for petroleum production Sulfonates/Sulfates powdered detergents, liquid detergents, shampoos, body washes, dishwashing liquids, industrial cleaners, emulsion polymerization, concrete superplasticizers, gypsum wallboard Esters and Derivatives shampoo, body wash, textile and leather treatment Nitrogen Derivatives bleach thickeners, baby shampoo, fabric conditioners, other personal care products Formulated Blends household detergents, textile and leather treatment, personal care products, pharmaceutical intermediates EO/PO Block Co-Polymers automatic dishwasher detergents Ethanolamines wood preservatives, herbicides, construction, gas treatment, metalworking LAB consumer detergents, industrial and institutional detergents, synthetic lubricants EG polyester fibers and PET bottle resins, antifreeze Surfactants. Surfactants or "surface active agents" are substances that combine a water-soluble component with a water insoluble component in the same molecule. While surfactants are most commonly used for their detergency in cleaning applications, they are also valued for their emulsification, foaming, dispersing, penetrating and wetting properties in a variety of industries. Demand growth for surfactants is relatively stable and exhibits little cyclicality. The main consumer product applications for surfactants can demand new formulations with improved performance characteristics, which affords considerable opportunity for innovative surfactants manufacturers like us to provide surfactants and blends with differentiated specifications and properties. For basic surfactants, pricing tends to have a strong relationship to underlying raw material prices and usually lags raw material price movements. Ethanolamines. Ethanolamines are a range of chemicals produced by the reaction of EO with ammonia. They are used as intermediates in the production of a variety of industrial, agricultural and consumer products. There are a limited number of competitors due to the technical and cost barriers to entry. Growth in this sector has typically been higher than GDP and has benefited from higher demand for agrochemical products. We believe the ethanolamines market in North America is balanced. LAB. LAB is a surfactant intermediate which is produced through the reaction of benzene with either normal paraffins or linear alpha olefins. Nearly all the LAB produced globally is converted into LAS, a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer, industrial and institutional laundry detergents. Three major manufacturers lead the traditional detergency market for LAB in North America: Procter & Gamble, Henkel and The Sun Products Corp. We believe that two-thirds of the LAB global capacity lies in the hands of seven producers, with two or three major players in each of the three 21 Table of Contents regional markets. Although the North American market for LAB is mature, we expect Latin America and other developing countries to grow as detergent demand grows at a faster rate than GDP. However, growth in demand for specialty alkylates for use in lubricants is expected to be higher than GDP. We have developed a unique manufacturing capability for a high molecular weight alkylate for this market. With a significant technical barrier to entry, our specialty alkylate capability has allowed us greater diversity in our portfolio and strengthened our competitive position versus LAB-only producers. EG. We consume our internally produced EO to produce three types of EG: MEG, DEG and TEG. MEG is consumed primarily in the polyester (fiber and bottle resin) and antifreeze end markets and is also used in a wide variety of industrial applications including synthetic lubricants, plasticizers, solvents and emulsifiers. DEG is consumed internally for the production of Morpholine/DGA® agent and polyols. TEG is used internally for the production of polyols and is sold into the market for dehydration of natural gas. We continue to optimize our EO and EG operations depending on the fundamental market demand for EG. Maleic Anhydride and Licensing. The following table sets forth the end markets for our maleic anhydride products: Product Group End Markets Maleic anhydride boat hulls, automotive, construction, lubricant and fuel additives, countertops, agrochemicals, paper, and food additives Maleic anhydride catalyst and technology licensing maleic anhydride, BDO and its derivatives, and PBT manufacturers Maleic anhydride is a chemical intermediate that is produced by oxidizing either benzene or normal butane through the use of a catalyst. The largest use of maleic anhydride in the U.S. is in the production of UPRs, which we believe account for approximately 47% of U.S. maleic anhydride demand. UPR is the main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced resins, which are used for marine and automotive applications and commercial and residential construction products. Our maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed process with solvent recovery and is characterized by low butane consumption and an energy-efficient, high-percentage-recovery solvent recovery system. This process competes against two other processes, the fluid bed process and the fixed bed process with water recovery. We believe that our process is superior in the areas of feedstock and energy efficiency and solvent recovery. The maleic anhydride-based route to BDO manufacture is currently the preferred process technology and is favored over the other routes, which include PO, butadiene and acetylene as feedstocks. As a result, the growth in demand for BDO has resulted in increased demand for our maleic anhydride technology and catalyst. Total U.S. demand for maleic anhydride in 2009 was approximately 475 million pounds. Over time, demand for maleic anhydride has generally grown at rates that slightly exceed GDP growth. However, given its dependence on the UPR market, which is heavily influenced by construction end markets, demand for this application can be cyclical. Pricing for maleic anhydride in North America over the past several years has been increasing but has recently declined with the drop in feedstock costs. Generally, changes in price have resulted from changes in industry capacity utilization as opposed to changes in underlying raw material costs. On April 1, 2008, we announced that Sasol-Huntsman GmbH KG, our 50/50 maleic anhydride joint venture located in Moers, Germany, would be expanding its manufacturing capacity by approximately 100 million pounds per year. The new capacity is expected to be available in the first 22 Table of Contents quarter of 2011. The joint venture has received committed nonrecourse financing that together with its cash flows from operations will be used to fund the expansion. Sales and Marketing We sell over 2,000 products to over 4,000 customers globally through our Performance Products marketing groups, which have extensive market knowledge, considerable chemical industry experience and well established customer relationships. Our performance specialties markets are organized around end-use market applications, such as coatings, polymers and resins and agrochemical. In these end uses, our marketing efforts are focused on how our product offerings perform in certain customer applications. We believe that this approach enhances the value of our product offerings and creates opportunities for ongoing differentiation in our development activities with our customers. Our performance intermediates and maleic anhydride markets organize their marketing efforts around their products and geographic regions served. We also provide extensive pre- and post-sales technical service support to our customers where our technical service professionals work closely with our research and development functions to tailor our product offerings to meet our customers unique and changing requirements. Finally, these technical service professionals interact closely with our market managers and business leadership teams to help guide future offerings and market approach strategies. In addition to our focused direct sales efforts, we maintain an extensive global network of distributors and agents that also sell our products. These distributors and agents typically promote our products to smaller end use customers who cannot be served cost effectively by our direct sales forces. Manufacturing and Operations Our Performance Products segment has the capacity to produce more than seven billion pounds annually of a wide variety of specialty, intermediate and commodity products and formulations at 16 manufacturing locations in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. These production capacities are as follows: Current capacity Product Area North America EAME APAC Total (millions of pounds) Performance Specialties Amines 667 124 (1) 33 824 Carbonates 69 69 Specialty surfactants 100 175 70 345 Performance Intermediates EG 890 55 945 EO 1,000 100 1,100 Ethanolamines 400 400 Ethylene 400 400 LAB 375 375 Propylene 300 300 Surfactants 470 1,675 30 2,175 Maleic anhydride 340 137 (2) 477 (1)Includes up to 30 million pounds of ethyleneamines that are made available from Dow's Terneuzen, Netherlands facility by way of a long-term supply arrangement. 23 Table of Contents (2)Represents total capacity of a facility owned by Sasol-Huntsman GmbH & Co. KG, of which we own a 50% equity interest and Sasol owns the remaining 50% interest. On April 1, 2008, we announced that Sasol-Huntsman GmbH KG would be expanding its manufacturing capacity by approximately 100 million pounds per year. The new capacity is expected to be available in the first quarter of 2011 and is not included in the production capacity table noted above. Our surfactants and amines facilities are located globally, with broad capabilities in amination, sulfonation and ethoxylation. These facilities have a competitive cost base and use modern manufacturing units that allow for flexibility in production capabilities and technical innovation. Through the major restructuring of our surfactant operations, we have significantly improved the competitiveness of our surfactants business. Our primary ethylene, propylene, EO, EG and ethanolamines facilities are located in Port Neches, Texas alongside our Polyurethanes' PO/MTBE facility. The Port Neches, Texas facility benefits from extensive logistics infrastructure, which allows for efficient sourcing of other raw materials and distribution of finished products. Our LAB facility in Chocolate Bayou, Texas and our maleic anhydride facility in Pensacola, Florida are both located within large, integrated petrochemical manufacturing complexes operated by Ascend. We believe this results in greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would be able to obtain if these facilities were stand-alone operations. Our unconsolidated ethyleneamine joint venture is currently constructing a plant in Jubail, Saudi Arabia. The plant will have approximate capacity of 60 million pounds per year with production expected early second quarter of 2010. Raw Materials We have the capacity to use approximately 850 million pounds of ethylene each year produced in part at our Port Neches, Texas facility in the production of EO and ethyleneamines. We consume all of our EO in the manufacture of our EG, surfactants and amines products. We also use internally produced PO and DEG in the manufacture of these products. We have the capacity to produce 400 million pounds of ethylene and 300 million pounds of propylene at our Port Neches, Texas facility. All of the ethylene is used in the production of EO and substantially all of the propylene is consumed by the PO unit at Port Neches operated by our Polyurethanes business. We purchase or toll the remainder of our ethylene and propylene requirements from third parties. In addition to internally produced raw materials, our performance specialties market purchases over 250 compounds in varying quantities, the largest of which includes ethylene dichloride, caustic soda, synthetic alcohols, paraffin, nonyl phenol, ammonia, hydrogen, methylamines and acrylonitrile. The majority of these raw materials are available from multiple sources in the merchant market at competitive prices. In our performance intermediates market, our primary raw materials, in addition to internally produced and third-party sourced EO and ethylene, are synthetic and natural alcohols, paraffin, alpha olefins, benzene and nonyl phenol. All of these raw materials are widely available in the merchant market at competitive prices. Maleic anhydride is produced by the reaction of n-butane with oxygen using our proprietary catalyst. The principal raw material is n-butane which is purchased pursuant to long-term contracts and delivered to our Pensacola, Florida site by barge and to our facility in Geismar, Louisiana via pipeline. Our maleic anhydride catalyst is toll-manufactured by BASF under a long-term contract according to our proprietary methods. These raw materials are available from multiple sources at competitive prices. 24 Table of Contents Competition In our performance specialties market, there are few competitors for many of our products due to the considerable customization of product formulations, the proprietary nature of many of our product applications and manufacturing processes and the relatively high research and development and technical costs involved. Some of our global competitors include BASF, Air Products, Dow, Tosoh, and Akzo. We compete primarily on the basis of product performance, new product innovation and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of price. There are numerous global producers of many of our performance intermediates products. Our main competitors include global companies such as Dow, Sasol, BASF, Petresa, Clariant, Shell, Cognis, Stepan and Kao, as well as various smaller or more local competitors. We compete on the basis of price with respect to the majority of our product offerings and, to a lesser degree, on the basis of product availability, performance and service with respect to certain of our more value-added products. In our maleic anhydride market, we compete primarily on the basis of price, customer service and plant location. Our competitors include Lanxess, Flint Hills Resources, Marathon, Polynt and BASF. We are the leading global producer of maleic anhydride catalyst. Competitors in our maleic anhydride catalyst market include Scientific Design and Polynt. In our maleic anhydride technology licensing market, our primary competitor is Scientific Design. We compete primarily on the basis of technological performance and service. The market in which our Performance Products segment operates is highly competitive. Among our competitors in this market are some of the world's largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources. Some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can. In addition, some of our competitors in this market have greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. If any of our current or future competitors in this market develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. Pigments General We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of titanium dioxide, which is a white pigment used to impart whiteness, brightness and opacity to products such as paints, plastics, paper, printing inks, fibers and ceramics. We operate seven titanium dioxide manufacturing facilities located in North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. The global titanium dioxide market is characterized by a small number of large, global producers and a growing compliment of smaller regional producers. We offer an extensive range of products, under the Tioxide® and Deltio® brand names, to approximately 1,500 customers in all major titanium dioxide end markets and geographic regions. The geographic diversity of our manufacturing facilities allows our Pigments segment to service local customers, as well as global customers that require delivery to more than one location. Our diverse customer base includes Ampacet, A. Schulman, Akzo Nobel, BASF, Cabot, Clariant, Jotun, PolyOne and PPG. Our pigments business has an aggregate annual nameplate capacity of approximately 560,000 tonnes at our seven production facilities. Four of our titanium dioxide manufacturing plants are located in Europe, one is in North America, one is in Asia, and one is in South Africa. Our North American operation consists of a 50% interest in a manufacturing joint venture with Kronos Worldwide, Inc. Our Pigments segment is focused on improving our competitive position and providing customers with innovative products and solutions. To further our competitive position we expanded our Greatham, U.K. chloride-based facility by 50% to 150,000 tonnes per annum capacity in 2008 and, during the first quarter of 2009, closed our Grimsby, U.K. sulphate-based facility. We continue to pursue other projects 25 Table of Contents to improve manufacturing costs at each of our facilities. We are also introducing a number of innovative new products to the market, including our Deltio® range of free-flowing pigments. Products and Markets Historically, global titanium dioxide demand growth rates tend to closely track global GDP growth rates. However, the demand growth rate and its relationship with the GDP growth rate varies by region. Developed markets such as the U.S. and Western Europe exhibit higher absolute consumption but lower demand growth rates, while emerging markets such as Asia exhibit much higher demand growth rates. The titanium dioxide industry experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting the high exposure to seasonal coatings end use markets. Coating sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year. There are two manufacturing processes for the production of titanium dioxide, the sulfate process and the chloride process. Most recent capacity additions by the five major producers have employed the chloride process technology while those by smaller producers have generally used the sulphate process technology. We currently believe that the chloride process accounts for approximately 60% of global production capacity. However, the global distribution of sulfate- and chloride-based titanium dioxide capacity varies by region, with the sulfate process being predominant in Europe, our primary market. The chloride process is the predominant process used in North America, and both processes are used in Asia. While most end-use applications can use pigments produced by either process, regional market preferences typically favor products that are locally available. We believe the chloride and sulfate manufacturing processes compete effectively in the marketplace. The titanium dioxide industry currently has five major producers and a large number of small regional or local producers. Titanium dioxide supply has historically kept pace with increases in demand as producers increased capacity through low cost incremental debottlenecks and efficiency improvements. During periods of low titanium dioxide demand, the industry experiences high stock levels and consequently reduces production to manage working capital. Pricing in the industry is driven primarily by supply/demand balance. Based upon current price levels and the long lead times for planning, governmental approvals and construction, we do not expect significant additional greenfield capacity in the near future. Sales and Marketing Approximately 85% of our titanium dioxide sales are made through our direct sales and technical services network, enabling us to cooperate more closely with our customers and to respond to our increasingly global customer base. Our concentrated sales effort and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve our leading market shares in a number of the countries where we manufacture titanium dioxide. In addition, we have focused on marketing products to higher growth industries. For example, we believe that our pigments business is well-positioned to benefit from the projected growth in the plastics sector which we expect to grow faster than the overall titanium dioxide market over the next several years. 26 Table of Contents Manufacturing and Operations Our pigments business has eight manufacturing sites in seven countries with a total capacity of approximately 560,000 tonnes per year. Approximately 72% of our titanium dioxide capacity is located in Western Europe. The following table presents information regarding our titanium dioxide facilities: Region Site Annual Capacity (tonnes) Process Western Europe Greatham, U.K. 150,000 Chloride Calais, France 95,000 Sulfate Huelva, Spain 80,000 Sulfate Scarlino, Italy 80,000 Sulfate North America Lake Charles, Louisiana(1) 70,000 Chloride Asia Teluk Kalung, Malaysia 60,000 Sulfate Southern Africa Umbogintwini, South Africa 25,000 Sulfate Total 560,000 (1)This facility is owned and operated by Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P., a manufacturing joint venture that is owned 50% by us and 50% by Kronos Worldwide. The capacity shown reflects our 50% interest in Louisiana Pigment Company L.P. In 2008, we completed the expansion of our Greatham, U.K. facility by 50,000 tonnes. We are also well positioned to selectively invest in new plant capacity based upon our ICON chloride technology. ICON technology allows for the construction of new capacity with world-scale economics at a minimum nameplate size of 65,000 tonnes. We believe competing chloride technologies typically require a minimum capacity of 100,000 tonnes to achieve comparable economics. Our chloride additions can be more easily absorbed into the market, which provides higher investment returns than larger capacity additions. During the first quarter of 2009, we closed our Grimsby, U.K. sulphate-based manufacturing facility. Joint Venture We own a 50% interest in Louisiana Pigment Company L.P., a manufacturing joint venture located in Lake Charles, Louisiana. The remaining 50% interest is held by our joint venture partner, Kronos Worldwide. We share production offtake and operating costs of the plant equally with Kronos Worldwide, though we market our share of the production independently. The operations of the joint venture are under the direction of a supervisory committee on which each partner has equal representation. Our investment in Louisiana Pigment Company L.P. is accounted for using the equity method. Raw Materials The primary raw materials used to produce titanium dioxide are titanium-bearing ores. We purchase the majority of our ore under long-term supply contracts with a number of ore suppliers. The majority of titanium-bearing ores are sourced from Australia, South Africa and Canada. Ore accounts for approximately 45% of pigment variable manufacturing costs, while utilities (electricity, gas and steam), sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account for approximately 30% of our variable manufacturing costs. 27 Table of Contents The world market for titanium bearing ores is characterized by a small number of large suppliers (Rio Tinto, Iluka and Exxaro) which account for approximately 60% of global supply and from which we purchase approximately 75% of our needs. However, the choice of producers has increased in recent years with a number of emerging suppliers based in India and Africa and we have broadened our supply base by purchasing increasing amounts of our ores from these suppliers. Over 80% of our ore purchases are made under agreements with terms of three or more years. Titanium dioxide producers extract titanium from ores and process it into pigmentary titanium dioxide using either the chloride or sulfate process. Once an intermediate titanium dioxide pigment has been produced, it is "finished" into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications. The finishing process is common to both the sulfate and chloride processes and is a major determinant of the final product's performance characteristics. The sulfate process generally uses less-refined ores that are cheaper to purchase but produce more co-product than the chloride process. Co-products from both processes require treatment prior to disposal in order to comply with environmental regulations. In order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase our cost competitiveness, we have developed and marketed the co-products of our pigments business. We sell over 50% of the co-products generated by our business. Competition The global markets in which our pigments business operates are highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on price. In addition, we also compete on the basis of product quality and service. The major global producers against whom we compete are DuPont, Tronox, Kronos and Cristal, each of which has a global presence and the ability to service all global markets. Some of our competitors may be able to produce products more economically than we can. In addition, some of our competitors in this market have greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. If any of our current or future competitors in this market develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. Moreover, the sulphate-based titanium dioxide technology used by our Pigments business is widely available. Accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we spent $145 million, $154 million and $145 million, respectively, on research and development. We support our business with a major commitment to research and development, technical services and process engineering improvement. Our research and development centers are located in The Woodlands, Texas, Everberg, Belgium, and Shanghai, China. Other regional development/technical service centers are located in Billingham, England (pigments); Auburn Hills, Michigan (polyurethanes for the automotive industry); Derry, New Hampshire, Shanghai, China, Deggendorf, Germany and Ternate, Italy (polyurethanes); Melbourne, Australia (surfactants); Port Neches, Texas (process engineering support); and Basel, Switzerland (textile effects). INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS Proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses, and other technology and inventions is important to our businesses. We own approximately 590 unexpired U.S. patents, approximately 175 patent applications (including provisionals) currently pending at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and approximately 3,850 foreign counterparts, including both issued patents and pending patent 28 Table of Contents applications. While a presumption of validity exists with respect to issued U.S. patents, we cannot assure that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Furthermore, we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application, or that if patents do issue, that these patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. Additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner. We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that confidentiality agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. In addition to our own patents and patent applications and proprietary trade secrets and know-how, we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to use trade secrets, know-how and related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities. We also have licensed or sub-licensed intellectual property rights to third parties. We have associated brand names with a number of our products, and we have approximately 175 U.S. trademark registrations (including applications for registration currently pending at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office), and approximately 5,100 foreign counterparts, including both registrations and applications for registration. However, there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted. Because of the breadth and nature of our intellectual property rights and our business, we do not believe that any single intellectual property right (other than certain trademarks for which we intend to maintain the applicable registrations) is material to our business. Moreover, we do not believe that the termination of intellectual property rights expected to occur over the next several years, either individually or in the aggregate, will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2009, we employed approximately 11,000 people in our operations around the world. Approximately 2,000 of these employees are located in the U.S., while approximately 9,000 are located in other countries. We believe our relations with our employees are good. ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS General We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, pollution, protection of the environment and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. Actual or alleged violations of safety laws, environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some environmental laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. 29 Table of Contents Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations. Accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. Environmental, Health and Safety Systems We are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety ("EHS") legal requirements, and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of EHS legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements, ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. Although EHS legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with, these EHS management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and minimizing overall risk to us. EHS Capital Expenditures We may incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under EHS laws, including costs to acquire, maintain and repair pollution control equipment. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our capital expenditures for EHS matters totaled $54 million, $58 million and $69 million, respectively. Since capital expenditures for these matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend, in part, on the timing, promulgation and enforcement of specific requirements, we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures will be indicative of future amounts required under EHS laws. Remediation Liabilities We have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. Similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of wastes that were disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses. Under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources. The extent of damage may not be fully known and the processes and cost of remediation may change as new information is obtained or technology for remediation is improved. Our process for estimating the expected cost for remediation considers the information available, technology that can be utilized and estimates of the extent of damage. Under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), and similar state laws, a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred, and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release. We have been notified by third parties of claims against us for cleanup liabilities at approximately 10 former facilities or third party sites, including, but not limited to, sites listed under CERCLA. Based on current information and past experiences at other CERCLA sites, we do not expect any of these third party claims to result in material liability to us. Outside the U.S., analogous contaminated property laws, such as those in effect in France and Australia, can hold past owners and/or operators liable for remediation at former facilities. In addition, under the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended ("RCRA"), and similar state laws, we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a condition to our hazardous waste permit. Some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use, including on-site waste disposal. We are aware of soil, groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites, and we 30 Table of Contents may find contamination at other sites in the future. For example, our Port Neches, Texas, and Geismar, Louisiana, facilities are the subject of ongoing remediation requirements under RCRA authority. Similar laws exist in a number of locations in which we currently operate manufacturing facilities, such as Australia, Switzerland, and Italy. In June of 2006, an agreement was reached between the local regulatory authorities and our Advanced Materials site in Pamplona, Spain to relocate our manufacturing operations in order to facilitate new urban development desired by the city. Subsequently, as required by the authorities, soil and groundwater sampling was performed and followed by a quantitative risk assessment. Although unresolved at this time, some level of remediation of site contamination may be required in the future, but the estimated cost is unknown because the remediation approach and timing has not been determined. By letter dated March 7, 2006, our Base Chemicals and Polymers facility in West Footscray, Australia, was issued a clean-up notice by the Australian (Victorian) EPA due to concerns about soil and groundwater contamination emanating from the site. The agency revoked the original clean-up notice on September 4, 2007 and issued a revised clean-up notice due to "the complexity of contamination issues" at the site. On March 31, 2009, we submitted the required Site Remediation Action Plan to the agency which proposed additional investigation and remediation method trials. We can provide no assurance that the EPA will agree with our proposed plan, will not seek to institute additional requirements for the site or that additional costs will not be associated with the clean up. Additionally, on September 8, 2009, we announced a decision to close this facility in early 2010. In the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a $30 million liability related to estimated environmental remediation costs at this site. In many cases, our potential liability arising from historical contamination is based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility. In these situations, we frequently obtained an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre-closing conditions. We have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites and, where applicable, mitigated our ultimate remediation liability. We cannot assure you; however, that all of such matters will be subject to indemnity, that the prior owner will honor its indemnity or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters. Based on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, if such indemnities are unavailable or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to such costs, and if such costs are material, then such expenditures may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. At the current time, we are unable to estimate the full cost, exclusive of indemnification benefits, to remediate any of the known contamination sites. Environmental Reserves We have accrued liabilities relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations, site reclamation and closure costs and known penalties. Liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our liability estimates are based upon requirements placed upon us by regulators, available facts, existing technology and past experience. The environmental liabilities do not include amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations. We had accrued $41 million and $7 million for environmental liabilities as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these amounts, $5 million and $4 million were classified as accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and 31 Table of Contents $36 million and $3 million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. In certain cases, our remediation liabilities may be payable over periods of up to 30 years. We may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued; however, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of such potential excess. Regulatory Developments In December 2006, the EU parliament and EU council approved a new EU regulatory framework for chemicals called "REACH" (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals). REACH took effect on June 1, 2007, and the program it establishes will be phased in over 11 years. Under the regulation, companies that manufacture in or import into the European Economic Area ("EEA") more than one metric tonne of a chemical substance per year will be required to register such chemical substances and isolated intermediates in a central database. Use authorizations will be granted for a specific chemical if the applicants can show that the risks in using the chemical are adequately controlled; and for chemicals where there are no suitable alternatives substances or technologies available and the applicant can demonstrate that the social and economic benefits of using the chemical outweigh the risks. In addition, specified uses of some hazardous substances may be restricted. Furthermore, all applicants will have to study the availability of alternative chemicals. If an alternative is available, an applicant will have to submit a "substitution" plan to the regulatory agency. The regulatory agency will only authorize persistent bio-accumulative and toxic substances if an alternative chemical is not available. The registration, evaluation and authorization phases of the program will require expenditures and resource commitments in order to, for example, participate in mandatory data-sharing forums; acquire, generate and evaluate data; prepare and submit dossiers for substance registration; obtain legal advice and reformulate products, if necessary. We have established a cross-business European REACH team that is working closely with our businesses to identify and list all substances we purchase or manufacture in, or import into, the EEA. Our pre-registration REACH compliance began on June 1, 2008, utilizing internal resources at nominal expense and we met all chemical pre-registration requirements by the November 30, 2008 regulatory deadline. We are currently proceeding with the registration of the high-volume and high-priority chemicals under the program, which must be registered no later than November 30, 2010. Although the total long-term cost for REACH compliance is not estimable at this time, we spent approximately $3 million, $2 million and $3 million during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, on REACH compliance. Greenhouse Gas Regulation In the EU and other jurisdictions committed to compliance with the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the "Kyoto Protocol"), there is an increasing likelihood that our manufacturing sites will be affected in some way over the next few years by regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions. For example, Australia recently proposed its Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which may impact our Australian operations, and program implementation is currently scheduled for 2011. In addition, although the U.S. is not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, several states are implementing their own GHG regulatory programs and a federal program in the U.S. is likely for the future. Draft U.S. federal legislation and the recent U.S. EPA Clean Air Act endangerment findings for carbon dioxide have focused corporate attention on the eventuality of measuring and reporting of GHG emissions for operations in the U.S. The U.S. EPA also recently mandated GHG reporting requirements for U.S. sources in excess of 25,000 tons beginning in 2010. Final details of a comprehensive U.S. GHG management approach is, as yet, uncertain. Nevertheless, we are already managing and reporting GHG emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to Kyoto Protocol obligations and/or EU emissions trading scheme requirements. Although these sites are subject to existing GHG legislation, few have 32 Table of Contents experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result, although it is likely that GHG emission restrictions will increase over time. Potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets used to meet GHG restriction and/or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. Currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites. Chemical Facility Anti-terrorism Rulemaking The Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") issued the final rule of their "Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard" in 2007. The initial phase of the rule required all chemical facilities in the U.S. to evaluate their facilities against the DHS Appendix A list of "Chemicals of Interest." Facilities which have specified chemicals in designated quantities on the Appendix A list were required to submit a "Top Screen" to DHS in 2008. A Top Screen is a questionnaire completed by a facility having Chemicals of Interest in designated threshold quantities. In early 2008, we submitted Top Screens for all of our covered facilities. After reviewing the Top Screens, DHS determined that some of our sites were "High Risk" facilities. As a result, we were required to perform security vulnerability assessments at the High Risk sites. The security vulnerability assessments were completed and sent to DHS during the fourth quarter of 2008. Based on their assessment of the security vulnerability assessments, we received notice from DHS that one of our sites was elevated to a higher security tier. The DHS determined the other three sites to be low security tiers. The three sites will be required to develop site security plans based on a list of 18 risk-based performance standards, but security improvements recommended from the site security plans are not anticipated to be material. We believe that security upgrades to the tier-elevated site will be required; however we do not know what these required updates will be and thus cannot reasonably estimate associated costs at this time, but they could be material. Additionally, on November 26, 2008, the Transportation Safety Administration of the DHS published a final rule regarding "rail security sensitive materials" that are received at or shipped from facilities. We have three sites that are subject to this new rule, but at this time do not anticipate that the costs to comply will be material. MTBE Developments We produce MTBE, an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline. Litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of MTBE in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability or materially adversely affect our sales and costs. Because MTBE has contaminated some water supplies, its use has become controversial in the U.S. and elsewhere, and its use has been effectively eliminated in the U.S. market. We currently market MTBE, either directly or through third parties, to gasoline additive customers located outside the U.S., although there are additional costs associated with such outside-U.S. sales, which may result in decreased profitability compared to historical sales in the U.S. We may also elect to use all or a portion of our precursor tertiary butyl alcohol to produce saleable products other than MTBE. If we opt to produce products other than MTBE, necessary modifications to our facilities will require significant capital expenditures and the sale of such other products may produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of MTBE. Numerous companies, including refiners, manufacturers and sellers of gasoline, as well as manufacturers of MTBE, have been named as defendants in more than 150 cases in U.S. courts that allege MTBE contamination in groundwater. Many of these cases were settled after the parties engaged in mediation supervised by a court-appointed special settlement master. Beginning in March 2007 and continuing through June 24, 2009, we have been named as a defendant in 18 of these lawsuits pending in New York state and federal courts. For more information, see "Item 3. Legal ProceedingsMTBE Litigation." The plaintiffs in the MTBE groundwater contamination cases generally seek compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, such as monitoring and abatement, and attorney fees. 33 Table of Contents While we currently have insufficient information to meaningfully assess our potential exposure in these cases, we have joined with a larger group of defendants in an effort to mediate the plaintiffs' claims. Mediation in late 2008 and early 2009 was unsuccessful. A further mediation session was held February 3, 2010 which resulted in a tentative settlement in each of the cases in which we have been named. Our allocated portion of the total settlement amount is not material and we have accrued a liability for the claims equal to our allocated portion of the settlement. It is possible that we could be named as a defendant in additional existing or future MTBE contamination cases. We cannot provide assurances that adverse results against us in existing or future MTBE contamination cases will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

RISK FACTORS Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Our industry is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with declining economic conditions. Our financial results are substantially dependent upon overall economic conditions in the United States, the European Union and Asia. Declining economic conditions in all or any of these locationsor negative perceptions about economic conditionscould result in a substantial decrease in demand for our products and could adversely affect our business. Indeed, as a result of the current economic downturn, we have experienced decreased demand for many of our products. Uncertain economic conditions and market instability make it difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to forecast demand trends. Renewed declines in demand would place additional pressure on our results of operations. The timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time. As a consequence, at present, we are unable to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on our financial condition or results of operations, and we can give no assurances as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future economic cycles impacting the chemical industry. Significant price volatility or interruptions in supply of our raw materials may result in increased costs that we may be unable to pass on to our customers, which could reduce our profitability. The prices of the raw materials that we purchase from third parties are cyclical and volatile. We purchase a substantial portion of these raw materials from third party suppliers, and, following the dispositions of our base chemicals and polymers businesses in 2007 and 2006, respectively, our purchases of certain products from third party suppliers have significantly increased. The cost of these raw materials represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses. The prices for a number of these raw materials generally follow price trends of, and vary with market conditions for, crude oil and natural gas feedstocks, which are highly volatile and cyclical. The feedstocks and other raw materials we consume are generally commodity products that are readily available at market prices. We frequently enter into supply agreements with particular suppliers, but disruptions of existing supply arrangements could substantially impact our profitability. If certain of our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products to recoup the higher raw materials costs. In addition, if any of the raw materials that we use become unavailable within the geographic area from which they are now sourced, then we may not be able to obtain suitable or cost effective substitutes. Any interruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our costs or decrease our revenues, which could reduce our cash flow. 35 Table of Contents Our supply agreements typically provide for market-based pricing and provide us only limited protection against price volatility. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding product price increases, we are not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all. Timing differences between raw material prices, which may change daily, and contract product prices, which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our cash flow. Any cost increase that we are not able to pass on to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Financial difficulties and related problems at our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners could have a material adverse effect on our business. The recent economic downturn has caused financial problems at some customers, vendors, suppliers and business partners. We rely on numerous vendors and suppliers and collaborations with other industry participants to provide us with chemicals, feedstocks and other raw materials, along with energy sources and, in certain cases, facilities, that we need to operate our business. If the economic downturn were to continue or worsen, some of these companies may be forced to reduce their output, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection. If this were to occur, it could materially adversely affect their ability to provide us with the raw materials, energy sources or facilities that we need, which could disrupt our operations, including the production of certain of our products. In addition, it could be difficult to find replacements for certain of our business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases. In addition, if the economic downturn were to continue or worsen, some of our customers may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, restructurings and liquidations, which could affect our business by reducing sales, increasing our risk in extending trade credit to customers and reducing our profitability. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer's financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer's receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our available cash and access to additional capital may be limited by our significant leverage, which could restrict our ability to grow our businesses. We have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding. As of December 31, 2009, we had total consolidated outstanding indebtedness of approximately $4,212 million (including the current portion of long-term debt) and a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 69%. This balance does not reflect approximately $254 million under our U.S. accounts receivable securitization program ("U.S. A/R Program") and our European accounts receivable securitization program ("EU A/R Program," and, collectively with the U.S. A/R Program, our "A/R Program" or "A/R Programs") at December 31, 2009. Our outstanding debt could have important consequences for our businesses, including the following: a high degree of debt makes us more vulnerable to the current downturn in our businesses, our industry and the economy in general, as a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations will be required to make payments on our indebtedness, making it more difficult to react to changes in our business and in market or industry conditions; a substantial portion of our future cash flow from operations may be required to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes, including the growth of our businesses; our ability to obtain additional financing may be constrained due to our existing level of debt, particularly in the current credit environment; and 36 Table of Contents part of our indebtedness is, and any future debt may be, subject to variable interest rates, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates. We require substantial capital to finance our operations and continued growth, and we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time for a variety of purposes, including acquiring additional businesses. However, our existing debt instruments contain restrictive covenants. Among other things, these covenants limit or prohibit our ability to incur more debt; make prepayments of other debt; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; issue capital stock; make investments; create liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate; and transfer or sell assets. Our debt instruments also require us to comply with certain financial covenants under certain circumstances. For example, after entering into a waiver on April 16, 2009, the leverage covenant applicable to our $650 million revolving facility (the "Revolving Facility") under our senior secured credit facilities (the "Senior Credit Facilities") requires us to maintain a maximum senior secured debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.00 to 1 when loans or letters of credit are outstanding under the Revolving Facility. We may consent to terminating the waiver in conjunction with a proposed amendment to the Revolving Facility that we are currently seeking. In that event, the required maximum senior secured debt to EBITDA ratio would return to 3.75 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the covenant. However, if we violate this covenant, it could lead to an event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities, which could require us to pay off the balance of the Senior Credit Facilities in full and result in a loss of such facilities. Given the current credit environment, it may not be possible for us to replace the Senior Credit Facilities with a substitute facility on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also must comply with certain financial covenants under our $250 million U.S. A/R Program and our €225 million (approximately $323 million) EU A/R Program. Failure to meet such covenants could lead to an event of default and could require us to cease use of such facilities, thus prohibiting us from borrowing against our receivables. A default under our A/R Programs would also constitute an event of default under our Senior Credit Facilities, which could require us to pay off the balance of the Senior Credit Facilities in full and result in a loss of such facilities. In summary, if debt under one or more of our facilities is accelerated, cross-default provisions in our debt instruments would likely be triggered, which would likely have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. Also, if we undergo a change of control, our debt instruments may require us to make an offer to purchase certain of our notes. Under these circumstances, we may also be required to repay indebtedness under our Senior Credit Facilities prior to our notes. In this event, we may not have the financial resources necessary to purchase such notes, which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing such notes. As of December 31, 2009, the current portion of our long term debt to affiliates totaled approximately $431 million. As of December 31, 2009, we had combined outstanding variable rate borrowings of approximately $2.2 billion. Assuming a 1% increase in interest rates, without giving effect to any interest rate hedges or our cash balances, our annual interest rate expense would increase by approximately $22 million. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain the funds required to meet payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of those instruments. In the event of a default, a holder of the indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed under those instruments to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest, the creditors under our Senior Credit Facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, and we or one or more of our subsidiaries could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 37 Table of Contents We may not be able to obtain funding because of the deterioration of the credit and capital markets. This may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs and from refinancing our existing indebtedness when it comes due. Global financial markets and economic conditions continue to be volatile, which has resulted in substantial deterioration in the credit and capital markets. These conditions, along with significant write-offs in the financial services sector and the re-pricing of credit risk, may make it difficult to obtain funding for our ongoing capital needs. In particular, the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets generally has diminished. Also, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at maturity on terms that are similar to existing debt, and reduced, or in some cases ceased, to provide funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that additional funding for our capital needs from credit and capital markets will be available if needed and, to the extent required, on acceptable terms. In addition, we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness when it comes due on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If we cannot meet our capital needs or refinance our existing indebtedness, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. A downgrade in the ratings of the securities of our Company or our subsidiaries could result in increased interest and other financial expenses related to future borrowings of our Company or our subsidiaries and could restrict our access to additional capital or trade credit. Standard and Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Service maintain credit ratings for our Company. Each of these ratings is currently below investment grade. Any decision by these or other ratings agencies to downgrade such ratings in the future could result in increased interest and other financial expenses relating to our future borrowings and could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms. In addition, any downgrade could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, trade credit extended by our suppliers of raw materials. The industries in which we compete are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors that have greater financial resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. Among our competitors are some of the world's largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources. Changes in the competitive landscape could make it difficult for us to retain our leadership position in various products and markets throughout the world. In addition, some of the companies with whom we compete may be able to produce products more economically than we can. Furthermore, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. While we are engaged in a range of research and development programs to develop new products and processes, to improve and refine existing products and processes, and to develop new applications for existing products, the failure to develop new products, processes or applications could make us less competitive. Moreover, if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. In addition, certain of our businesses use technology that is widely available. Accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low in certain product segments of our business, and 38 Table of Contents the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing. Further, petroleum-rich countries have become more significant participants in the petrochemical industry and may expand this role significantly in the future. Increased competition in any of our businesses could compel us to reduce the prices of our products, which could result in reduced profit margins and loss of market share and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Future acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures may require significant resources and/or result in unanticipated adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. In the future we may seek to grow by making acquisitions or entering into partnerships and joint ventures. Any future acquisition, partnership or joint venture may require that we make a significant cash investment, issue stock or incur substantial debt. In addition, acquisitions, partnerships or investments may require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted from our other operations. These capital, equity and managerial commitments may impair the operation of our businesses. Any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of additional risks, including: the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships; increased operating costs; exposure to unanticipated liabilities; and difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings. We have incurred indebtedness to finance past acquisitions. We may finance future acquisitions with additional indebtedness. We could face financial risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness, such as reducing our liquidity and access to financial markets and increasing the amount of cash flow required to service indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, legal restrictions and taxes. We conduct a majority of our business operations outside the U.S., and these operations are subject to risks normally associated with international operations. These risks include the need to convert currencies that may be received for our products into currencies in which we purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, we translate our local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Because we currently have significant operations located outside the U.S., we are exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in gains or losses on our financial statements. Other risks of international operations include trade barriers, tariffs, exchange controls, national and regional labor strikes, social and political risks, general economic risks and required compliance with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, including tax laws. Furthermore, in foreign jurisdictions where process of law may vary from country to country, we may experience difficulty in enforcing agreements. In jurisdictions where bankruptcy laws and practices may vary, we may experience difficulty collecting foreign receivables through foreign legal systems. The occurrence of these risks, among others, could 39 Table of Contents disrupt the businesses of our international subsidiaries, which could significantly affect their ability to make distributions to us. We operate in a significant number of jurisdictions, which contributes to the volatility of our effective tax rate. Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our effective tax rate. In addition, generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP" or "U.S. GAAP") has required us to place valuation allowances against our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in a significant number of tax jurisdictions. These valuation allowances result from a cumulative history of pre-tax operating losses in specific tax jurisdictions. Valuation allowances have resulted in material fluctuations in our effective tax rate. Economic conditions may dictate the continued imposition of the current valuation allowances and potentially the establishment of new valuation allowances. While significant valuation allowances remain, our effective tax rate will likely continue to experience significant fluctuations. The current administration has announced several proposals to reform U.S. tax laws, including a proposal to further limit foreign tax credits and a proposal to defer tax deductions allocable to non-U.S. earnings until earnings are repatriated. It is unclear whether these proposed changes will be enacted, or, if enacted, what the scope of the reforms will be. Depending on their content, such reforms, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Demand for many of our products is cyclical, and we may experience depressed market conditions for such products. Historically, the markets for many of our products have experienced alternating periods of tight supply, causing prices and profit margins to increase, followed by periods of capacity additions, resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins. The volatility these markets experience occurs as a result of changes in the supply and demand for products, changes in energy prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world. This cyclicality and volatility of our industry results in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over the business cycle. Natural or other disasters could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or in higher expenses. Any serious disruption at any of our facilities due to hurricane, fire, earthquake, flood, terrorist attack or any other natural or man-made disaster could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses. If there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of these facilities, it could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and negatively impact our operating results. In addition, many of our current and potential customers are concentrated in specific geographic areas. A disaster in one of these regions could have a material adverse impact on our operations, operating results and financial condition. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that could disrupt our business, we cannot provide assurances that our plans would fully protect us from all such disasters or events that might result due to climate change. In addition, insurance may not adequately compensate us from any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters. Furthermore, in areas prone to frequent natural or other disasters, insurance may become increasingly expensive or not at all available. Our operations involve risks that may increase our operating costs, which could reduce our profitability. Although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of differentiated and commodity chemical products. These hazards include: chemical spills, pipeline leaks 40 Table of Contents and ruptures, storage tank leaks, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other hazards incident to the manufacturing, processing, handling, transportation and storage of dangerous chemicals. We are also potentially subject to other hazards, including natural disasters and severe weather; explosions and fires; transportation problems, including interruptions, spills and leaks; mechanical failures; unscheduled downtimes; labor difficulties; remediation complications; and other risks. Many potential hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities. Furthermore, we are subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure, exposure of contractors on our premises as well as other persons located nearby, workers' compensation and other matters. We maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. We maintain property damage and business interruption insurance policies and products liability insurance policies, as well as insurance policies covering other types of risks, including pollution legal liability insurance. Each of these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions, deductibles and coverage limits, in accordance with industry standards and practices. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. We are a party to various pending lawsuits and proceedings. It is possible that judgments could be rendered against us in these cases or others in which we could be uninsured or not covered by indemnity and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. We are subject to many environmental and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability. We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment and human health, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. Actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some environmental laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. Continually increasing concerns regarding the safety of chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on the environment constitute a growing trend. Governmental, regulatory and societal demands for continuously increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection could result in continued pressure for more stringent regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry. In addition, these concerns could influence public perceptions, the viability of certain products, our reputation, the cost to comply with regulations, and the ability to attract and retain employees. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations. Accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability. We could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future environmental or safety laws. Capital expenditures and costs relating to environmental or safety matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations. Capital expenditures and costs 41 Table of Contents beyond those currently anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future environmental or safety laws. Furthermore, we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off-site locations where we disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre-dated our purchase of our businesses. We may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future environmental laws. Existing or future litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of MTBE in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability, materially reduce our sales and/or materially increase our costs. We produce MTBE, an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline. Litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of MTBE in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability or materially adversely affect our sales and costs. Because MTBE has contaminated some water supplies, its use has become controversial in the U.S. and elsewhere, and its use has been effectively eliminated in the U.S. market. We currently market MTBE, either directly or through third parties, to gasoline additive customers located outside the U.S., although there are additional costs associated with such outside-U.S. sales which may result in decreased profitability compared to historical sales in the U.S. We may also elect to use all or a portion of our precursor tertiary butyl alcohol to produce saleable products other than MTBE. If we opt to produce products other than MTBE, necessary modifications to our facilities will require significant capital expenditures and the sale of such other products may produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of MTBE. Numerous companies, including refiners, manufacturers and sellers of gasoline, as well as manufacturers of MTBE, have been named as defendants in more than 150 cases in U.S. courts that allege MTBE contamination in groundwater. Many of these cases were settled after the parties engaged in mediation supervised by a court-appointed special settlement master. Beginning in March 2007 and continuing through June 24, 2009, we have been named as a defendant in 18 of these lawsuits pending in New York state and federal courts. For more information, see "Item 3 Legal ProceedingsMTBE Litigation." The plaintiffs in the MTBE groundwater contamination cases generally seek compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, such as monitoring and abatement, and attorney fees. While we currently have insufficient information to meaningfully assess our potential exposure in these cases, we have joined with a larger group of defendants in an effort to mediate the plaintiffs' claims. Mediation in late 2008 and early 2009 was unsuccessful. A further mediation session was held February 3, 2010 which resulted in a tentative settlement in each of the cases in which we have been named. Our allocated portion of the total settlement amount is not material and we have accrued a liability for the claims equal to our allocated portion of the settlement. It is possible that we could be named as a defendant in additional existing or future MTBE contamination cases. We cannot provide assurances that adverse results against us in existing or future MTBE contamination cases will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Failure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations Information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, processing transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or our information, or damage to our reputation. While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. 42 Table of Contents Our business is dependent on our intellectual property. If our patents are declared invalid or our trade secrets become known to our competitors, our ability to compete may be adversely affected. Proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses and other technology is important to our business. Consequently, we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. While a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us in the U.S., there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Furthermore, if any pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent, or if patents are issued to us, but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our intellectual property, then our ability to compete may be adversely affected. Additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, these confidentiality agreements may be breached, may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and know-how. In addition, others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. The failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or proprietary know-how could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Loss of key members of our management could disrupt our business. We depend on the continued employment and performance of our senior executives and other key members of management. If any of these individuals resigns or becomes unable to continue in his or her present role and is not adequately replaced, our business operations and our ability to implement our growth strategies could be materially disrupted. We generally do not have employment agreements with, and we do not maintain any "key person" life insurance for, any of our executive officers. Conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks and general instability throughout the world, and in particular in certain energy-producing nations, along with increased security regulations related to our industry, could adversely affect our business. Conflicts, military actions and terrorist attacks have precipitated global economic instability and turmoil in world financial markets. Current regional tensions and conflicts in energy-producing nations, including continuing instability in Iran, ongoing military action in Iraq, and other conflicts have caused, and may cause further, increases in raw material costs, particularly natural gas and crude oil based feedstocks, which are used in our operations. The uncertainty surrounding the threat of further armed hostilities, military action or acts of terrorism may impact any or all of our physical facilities and operations, which are located in North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, South America and the Middle East, or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, the resulting economic disruption caused by such events may result in reduced demand from our customers for our products. A military action or terrorist attack that impacts any of our facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a number of governments have begun regulatory processes that could lead to new regulations impacting the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals, which could result in higher operating costs. These developments will subject our worldwide operations to increased risks and, 43 Table of Contents depending on their magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. If our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us, then we will not be able to make payment on our debts. Our debt is generally the exclusive obligation of Huntsman International and our guarantor subsidiaries. Because a significant portion of our operations are conducted by non-guarantor subsidiaries, our cash flow and our ability to service indebtedness, including our ability to pay the interest on our debt when due and principal of such debt at maturity, are dependent to a large extent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from such non-guarantor subsidiaries. Any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances by our non-guarantor subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. In addition, payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, except for our guarantor subsidiaries, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any funds available for those amounts, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, our debt. Any right that we have to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary, and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary. Climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could adversely impact our results of operations. In addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us, climate change mitigation programs and regulation could significantly increase our costs. Energy costs are a significant component of our overall costs, and climate change regulation may result in significant increases in energy costs. Specifically, our costs could increase if energy companies pass on increased costs to their customers, such as costs resulting from carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards. For specific details, see individual risk factors listed above. 44 Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND DEBT SECURITIES Our stock price has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations. We have experienced significant fluctuations in our stock price and share trading volume in the past and may continue to do so. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of issues, including broad market factors that may have a material adverse impact on our stock price, regardless of actual performance. The following factors could affect our stock price: periodic variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of our business or that of our competitors; downward revisions in securities analysts' estimates of our future operating results or of the future operating results of our competitors; material announcements by us or our competitors; public sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock; and adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends or in conditions or trends in the markets in which we operate. Shares available for future sale may cause our common stock price to decline, which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. Sales of substantial numbers of additional shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock to decline. We have the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to further dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities would result in dilution of then-existing stockholders' equity interests in us. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to establish one or more series of preferred stock and to determine, with respect to any series of preferred stock, the number of shares in that series and the terms, rights and limitations of that series. If we issue convertible notes or convertible preferred stock, a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common stockholders' interest. Our Board of Directors has no present intention of issuing any such convertible instruments, but reserves the right to do so in the future. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock under our equity incentive plans. Certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, limit your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value. Certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, such as a classified Board of Directors, limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings and certain provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our Company, even if some of our stockholders considered such a change of control to be beneficial. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. Therefore, our Board of Directors could elect to issue preferred stock that has special voting or other rights that could make it even more difficult for a third party to acquire us, which may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value. 45 Table of Contents The declaration of dividends by our Company is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and limitations under Delaware law, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends. Over the past three years we have paid quarterly dividends on our common stock. The declaration of dividends by our Company is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors takes into account such matters as general business conditions, our financial results, expected liquidity and capital expenditure requirements, contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends, the effect on our debt ratings and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant, and we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock. In addition, Delaware law contains certain restrictions on a company's ability to pay cash dividends and we can provide no assurance that those restrictions will not prevent us from paying a dividend in future periods. Jon M. Huntsman, through direct and indirect ownership of our common stock and through certain voting arrangements, may be deemed to control approximately 20% of our outstanding common stock, and he may have the ability to substantially impact the outcome of matters voted on by our stockholders. Jon M. Huntsman, through direct and indirect ownership of our common stock and through certain voting arrangements, may be deemed to control approximately 20% of our outstanding common stock. Through his interests, he may have the ability to substantially impact: the election of the members of the Board of Directors of our Company; the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including amendments to our certificate of incorporation, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets; and any potential change in control of our Company. We may purchase a portion of our debt securities. We may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem a portion of our debt securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Any such repurchases or redemptions and the timing and amount thereof would depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Such transactions could impact the market for our debt securities and negatively affect our liquidity. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS As of December 31, 2009, we did not have any unresolved comments from the staff of the SEC.
