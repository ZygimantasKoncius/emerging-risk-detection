BUSINESS Overview Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("we," "Tyco Electronics," or the "Company") is a leading global provider of engineered electronic components, network solutions, specialty products, and undersea telecommunication systems. We design, manufacture, and market products for customers in a broad array of industries including automotive; data communication systems and consumer electronics; telecommunications; aerospace, defense, and marine; medical; energy; and lighting. Our products are produced in nearly 100 manufacturing sites in approximately 25 countries. With approximately 7,000 engineers and worldwide manufacturing, sales, and customer service capabilities, Tyco Electronics' commitment is our customers' advantage. Tyco Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). For the period following its incorporation, Tyco Electronics Ltd. did not engage in any significant business activities and held minimal assets. Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of its shares of Tyco Electronics to its common shareholders (referred to in this report as the "separation"). Tyco Electronics Ltd. became an independent, publicly traded company owning the former electronics businesses of Tyco International Ltd. In connection with the separation, the equity interests in the entities that hold all of the assets and liabilities of Tyco International's electronics businesses were transferred to Tyco Electronics. Our business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions, from fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2002, of established electronics companies and divisions, including the acquisition of AMP Incorporated and Raychem Corporation in fiscal 1999 and the Electromechanical Components Division of Siemens and OEM Division of Thomas & Betts in fiscal 2000. These companies each have more than 50 years of history in engineering and innovation excellence. We operated as a segment of Tyco International prior to our separation. Effective June 25, 2009, we discontinued our existence as a Bermuda company as provided in Section 132G of The Companies Act of 1981 of Bermuda, as amended (the "Bermuda Companies Act"), and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law, continued our existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations. The rights of holders of our shares are now governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations. We operate through four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Specialty Products, and Undersea Telecommunications. In May 2009, we sold our Wireless Systems business which has been reclassified as discontinued operations. Prior to reclassification to held for sale and discontinued operations, this business was reported as our former Wireless Systems segment. Also, effective January 1, 2009, we established the Specialty Products Group from our existing businesses. The results of this new organization are reported as a separate reporting segment. This new segment is comprised of the Aerospace, Defense, and Marine; Touch Systems; Medical; and Circuit Protection businesses which were formerly reported in the Electronic Components segment. Prior period segment information has been revised to conform to the current segment reporting structure in all periods presented. See Notes 1 and 24 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments. 1 Table of Contents Our reporting segments manufacture and distribute our products and solutions to a number of end markets. The table below provides a summary of our reporting segments, the fiscal 2009 net sales contribution of each segment, and the key products and markets that we serve: Segment Electronic Components Network Solutions Specialty Products Undersea Telecommunications % of Fiscal 2009 Net Sales 58% 17% 14% 11% Key Products  Connector systems  Connector systems  Connector systems  Undersea  Relays  Heat shrink tubing  Touch screens telecommunication  Heat shrink tubing  Fiber optics  Circuit protection systems  Fiber optics  Wire and cable devices  Wire and cable  Racks and panels  Wire and cable  Application tooling  Intelligent building  Relays controls  Heat shrink  Network interface tubing devices Key Markets  Automotive  Energy  Aerospace, defense,  Communication  Computer  Communication and marine service providers  Communications service providers  Touch systems  Oil and gas  Appliance  Enterprise networks  Medical  Industrial  Circuit protection  Consumer electronics See Note 24 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for certain segment and geographic financial information relating to our business. Our Competitive Strengths We believe that we have the following competitive strengths: Global leader in passive components. With net sales of approximately $10.3 billion in fiscal 2009, we are significantly larger than many of our competitors. In the fragmented connector industry, which was estimated to be $34 billion in fiscal 2009, our net sales were approximately $6 billion. We have established a global leadership position in the connector industry with leading market positions in the following markets: Automotive#1 Industrial#1 Computers and peripherals#2 Telecom/data communications#3 Our scale provides us the opportunity to accelerate our sales growth by making larger investments in existing and new technologies in our core markets and to expand our presence in emerging markets.

We manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that this diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduces our exposure to particular end markets, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors. Balanced geographic sales mix. We have an established manufacturing presence in approximately 25 countries and our sales are global. Our global coverage positions us near our customers' locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile. In addition, our strategy is to continue to increase the percentage of production from lower-cost countries. Strong and experienced management team. We believe we have a management team that has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our Chief Executive Officer and segment leaders average more than 20 years of experience of which most is in the electronics industry. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team that is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry. Our Strategy Our goal is to be the world leader in providing custom-engineered electronic components and solutions for an increasingly connected world. We believe that in achieving this goal we will increase net sales and profitability across our segments in the markets that we serve. Our business strategy is based upon the following priorities: Leverage our market leadership position to increase our market share. We are a global leader in many of the markets that we serve. For example, within our Electronic Components segment, we are the leading global supplier of connectors and connector systems to the automotive and industrial markets. We believe that these and other markets are critical to our success and that we must continue to strengthen our leadership position in these markets. We plan to capitalize on the expected long-term growth in these markets by leveraging our significant scale in the industry, the breadth of our product portfolio, our established relationships and leading specification positions with our customers, and our extensive worldwide distribution channels. Achieve market leadership in attractive and under-penetrated industries.

These markets include: the alternate energy and lighting markets with respect to our Electronic Components segment; the energy, communication service providers, and enterprise networks markets with respect to our Network Solutions segment; and the aerospace, defense, and marine, touch systems, and medical markets with respect to our Specialty Products segment. We believe that we can further leverage 3 Table of Contents our customer service and our new product and technology capabilities in order to achieve a leading position in these markets. Extend our leadership in key emerging markets. We seek to improve our market leadership position in emerging geographic regions, including China, Eastern Europe, and India, which we expect will experience higher growth rates than those of more developed regions in the world. In fiscal 2009, we generated $1.4 billion of net sales in China, $0.7 billion of net sales in Eastern Europe, and $0.2 billion of net sales in each of India and Brazil. We believe that expansion in these regions will enable us to grow faster than the overall global market. Supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. We will evaluate and selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that strengthen our market position, enhance our existing product offering, enable us to enter attractive markets, expand our technological capabilities, and provide synergy opportunities. Improve operating margins. We intend to continue to increase our productivity and reduce our manufacturing costs. We plan to achieve this by developing best in class manufacturing, enhancing our purchasing strategy through design initiatives and sourcing of materials from suppliers in lower-cost regions, simplifying our distribution network, and further implementing best practice continuous improvement programs. We also plan to continue to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, both by migrating facilities from higher-cost to lower-cost countries and by consolidating within countries. With respect to our manufacturing rationalization plan, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $350 million through 2011 related to current as well as future restructuring actions. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry. Accelerate new product development through research and development excellence. We seek to continue to increase the percentage of our annual net sales from new products. In fiscal 2009, we derived approximately 31% of our net sales from new products launched within the previous three years. In order to accomplish this goal, we intend to focus our research, development, and engineering investment on next generation technologies and highly engineered products and platforms, and leverage innovation across our segments.

We own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks. While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is dependent on patent or trademark protection or that our operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. 10 Table of Contents Employees As of September 25, 2009, we employed approximately 78,000 people worldwide, of whom 20,000 were in the Americas region, 23,000 were in the Europe/Middle East/Africa region, and 35,000 were in the Asia-Pacific region. Of our total employees, approximately 46,000 were employed in manufacturing and 18,000 were represented by collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 60% of our employees were based in lower-cost countries, primarily China. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. Government Regulation and Supervision The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the United States and other countries. A small portion of our products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction. Environmental We are committed to complying with all applicable environmental, health, and safety laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards, staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues, periodic compliance auditing, training, and other measures. We have a program for compliance with the European Union ("EU") Restriction on Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronics Equipment Directives, the China RoHS law, and similar laws. We have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, current information and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $13 million to $26 million. As of September 25, 2009, we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately $16 million.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to risks that affect many other companies, such as general economic conditions, geopolitical events, competition, technological obsolescence, labor relations, and international operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Risks Relating to Our Business Current and future conditions in the global economy and global capital markets, and cyclical industry conditions, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. As a result of global economic trends, the credit market crisis, lower consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, and other challenges currently affecting the global economy, our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. Further, our vendors may be experiencing similar conditions, which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. If the global economic slowdown continues for significant periods or deteriorates significantly, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, we are heavily dependent on the end market industry dynamics for our products, and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand patterns of these markets. Our sales are dependent on certain end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets. For example, the automotive industry, which accounted for approximately 27% of our net sales in fiscal 2009, is experiencing a significant downturn described below. The telecommunications industry, which accounted for approximately 27% of our net sales in fiscal 2009, has historically experienced periods of robust capital expenditure followed by periods of retrenchment and consolidation, which reflects current market conditions. The aerospace and defense industry, which accounted for 6% of our net sales in fiscal 2009, has similarly undergone significant fluctuations in demand, depending on worldwide economic and political conditions. These periodic downturns in our customers' industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We are dependent on the automotive industry which is experiencing significant declines in the current economic environment. Approximately 27% of our net sales for fiscal 2009 were to customers in the automotive industry. Automotive manufacturers globally are experiencing significant declines in sales of vehicles from the current economic downturn and credit conditions. Additionally, the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers. As a supplier of automotive electronics products, our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by changes in the operations, products, business models, part-sourcing requirements, financial condition, and market share of automotive manufacturers, as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers. 12 Table of Contents We are dependent on the telecommunications, computer, and consumer electronics industries. Approximately 27% of our net sales for fiscal 2009 came from sales to the telecommunications industry. Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change and has been affected by declines in consumer and business spending due to global economic conditions. Additionally, these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in the telecommunications industry, and our failure to do so would materially impair our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Approximately 7% of our net sales for fiscal 2009 came from sales to the computer and consumer electronics industries. Demand for our computer and consumer electronics products depends primarily on underlying business and consumer demand for new computer and consumer electronics products, which has been affected by reduced spending due to global economic conditions. The amount of this demand and therefore our sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors, including the rate of technological change, degree of consumer acceptance of new products, and general economic conditions. We cannot assure you that existing levels of business and consumer demand for new computer and consumer electronics products will not decrease. Disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding. The global equity markets have been volatile and credit markets globally have been disrupted, which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit. If these conditions continue or worsen, we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business. Our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures. The extent of any impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity, the cost of financing, and other general economic and business conditions. We encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry. We operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components. The competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large, diversified manufacturers to small, highly specialized manufacturers. The electronic components industry has continued to become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years, and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. A number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price, and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products. We cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter our markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors. Recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill could negatively affect our results of operations. We test goodwill allocated to reporting units for impairment annually during the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances exist that indicate that a reporting unit's carrying value may exceed its fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no impairment existed. Significant judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including, among others, operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. There are inherent 13 Table of Contents uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, as a result of declines in sales and profitability of the Automotive and Communications and Industrial Solutions reporting units of the Electronic Components segment and the Circuit Protection reporting unit of the Specialty Products segment, we determined that an indicator of impairment had occurred and goodwill impairment testing of these reporting units was required. The testing for goodwill impairment is a two step process. In performing step I of impairment testing, we determined the fair value of the Automotive, Communications and Industrial Solutions, and Circuit Protection reporting units based on a discounted cash flows analysis incorporating our estimate of future operating performance. The results of the step I goodwill impairment tests indicated that the book value of each of the reporting units exceeded its fair value. The failure of the step I goodwill impairment tests triggered step II goodwill impairment tests in which we determined the implied fair value of the reporting units' goodwill by comparing the reporting units' fair value determined in step I to the fair value of the reporting units' net assets, including unrecognized intangible assets. The step II goodwill impairment tests resulted in a full impairment charge of $2,088 million for the Automotive reporting unit and partial impairment charges of $1,347 million and $112 million for the Communications and Industrial Solutions and Circuit Protection reporting units, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Should economic conditions deteriorate further or remain depressed for a prolonged period of time, estimates of future cash flows for our reporting units may be insufficient to support carrying value and the goodwill assigned to it, requiring us to perform additional tests for impairment. Further impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of operations and financial position. We are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue growth. The markets in which we operate are subject to rapid technological change. Our long-term operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands. Like other suppliers to the electronics industry, we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices. Over the past several years we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, pressure each year to lower our prices. In recent years, we have experienced price erosion averaging from 1% to 2%. In order to maintain our margins, we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts. We cannot assure you that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate. Many of the industries to which we sell our products, as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials, have become increasingly concentrated in recent years, including the automotive, telecommunications, computer, and aerospace and defense industries. Consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us. In addition, as our customers buy in larger volumes, their volume buying power has increased, and they have been able to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase. Our materials suppliers similarly have increased their 14 Table of Contents ability to negotiate favorable pricing. These trends may adversely affect the profit margins on our products, particularly for commodity components. Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost. We are a large buyer of resin, copper, gold, brass, steel, chemicals and additives, and zinc. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of regions around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, the price of many of these raw materials, including gold, has increased in recent years and continues to fluctuate. Over the last three years, we have only been able to partially offset these increases through higher selling prices. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are continued significant price increases for these raw materials. Any of these events could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials and, to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers, our margins may decline, materially affecting our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results. We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Approximately 50% of our net sales for fiscal 2009 were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, and we expect revenue from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue. Therefore, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the Euro, our U.S. Dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. Changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We manage this risk in part by entering into financial derivative contracts. In addition to the risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts, our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful. The life cycles of our products can be very short. The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to the development cycles. As a result, the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue, and, from time to time, we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. If we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected. A decline in the market value of our pension plans' investment portfolios could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Concerns about deterioration in the global economy, together with the current credit crisis, have caused significant volatility in interest rates and equity prices, which could decrease the value of our pension plans' investment portfolios. A decrease in the value of our pension plans' investment portfolios could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We may use components and products manufactured by third parties. We may rely on third-party suppliers for the components used in our products, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. We also have third-party arrangements for the manufacture of certain products, parts, and components. If 15 Table of Contents these third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts, and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel. Our success depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain key employees at our operations around the world. We depend on highly skilled technical personnel to design, manufacture, and support our wide range of electronic components. Additionally, we rely upon experienced managerial, marketing, and support personnel to manage our business effectively and to successfully promote our wide range of products. Any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the necessary global management, technical, human resource, and financial skills to achieve our objectives may have adverse affects on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. If any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws, our business may suffer. Our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in particular the United States and the European Union. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial, including distribution, agreements and practices with respect to the electrical components or other markets is found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We also may be subject to third party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce any of our commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Future acquisitions may not be successful. We regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings. We cannot assure you, however, that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. Nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity. If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. This acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures. We cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to undertake an acquisition by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares. 16 Table of Contents Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. While we have substantially completed the streamlining of our portfolio that we began over two years ago, we may in the future evaluate the performance of specific businesses and may continue to sell businesses or product lines. Any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, and the potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered. We are subject to global risks of political, economic, and military instability. Our workforce, manufacturing, administrative, and sales facilities, markets, customers, and suppliers are located throughout the world, and we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including: tariffs, trade barriers, and trade disputes; regulations related to customs and import/export matters; variations in lengths of payment cycles; tax issues, such as tax law changes, examinations by taxing authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country, and difficulties in repatriating in a tax-efficient manner cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions; challenges in collecting accounts receivable; employment regulations and local labor conditions; difficulties protecting intellectual property; instability in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts; and the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements. We have sizeable operations in China, including manufacturing operations, and in fiscal 2009, 14% of our net sales were made to customers in China. The legal system in China is still developing and is subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and orders for products in China could be adversely affected by changes to or interpretation of Chinese law. We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such 17 Table of Contents violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, and violations. We are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and non-U.S. environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things: the generation, storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites; and the health and safety of our employees. We may not have been, or we may not at all times be, in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Environmental laws outside of the United States are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens. Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigative, removal, and remedial costs under certain federal and state laws are retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup, and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites. While we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present, or future business activities. Our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material content, and recycling. The EU, China, and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws include the EU Restriction on Hazardous Substances, End of Life Vehicle and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives, the EU REACH (chemical registration) Directive, the China law on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution by Electronic Information Products, and various other laws. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. We cannot predict the extent to which these laws will proliferate in other jurisdictions or 18 Table of Contents expand to address other materials or other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale. These laws could make manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions. Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology. The electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry, companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement or that we will not pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the size and importance of the patent or trademark in question, an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant in litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, anti-competitive behavior, and product liability. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us. Our bank credit facility contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt (as defined in the credit facility) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined in the credit facility), and limits on subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens. Our outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens, sale and lease-back transactions, and our ability to consolidate, merge, and sell assets. Although we believe none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our ability to meet the financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures. Upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures, the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our bank credit facility. If the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness. Acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder. The indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the repurchase date, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures). We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to repurchase the notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event. 19 Table of Contents Risks Relating to Our Separation from Tyco International We are responsible for a portion of Tyco International's contingent and other corporate liabilities, including those relating to shareholder litigation. In connection with our separation from Tyco International on June 29, 2007, we, Tyco International, and its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien") entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement which governs the relationships among us, Tyco International, and Covidien subsequent to the separation and provided for the allocation among us, Tyco International, and Covidien of Tyco International's assets, liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to the separation. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, subject to certain exceptions contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement among the parties, we, Tyco International, and Covidien have agreed to assume and be responsible for 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain of Tyco International's contingent and other corporate liabilities. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate liabilities are shared equally among the parties. These contingent and other corporate liabilities primarily relate to consolidated securities litigation, any actions with respect to the separation or the distribution brought by any third party and tax liabilities for periods prior to and including the date of separation of June 29, 2007. For more information on the contingent tax liabilities, see "We share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date." Contingent and other corporate liabilities do not include liabilities that are specifically related to one of the three separated companies, which were allocated 100% to the relevant company. If any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment, when due, of any of these assumed obligations, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other non-defaulting party the amounts in default. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities, including associated costs and expenses. Prior to the announcement by Tyco International of the planned separation of Tyco Electronics and Covidien in January 2006, Tyco International and certain of its former directors and officers were named as defendants in over 40 purported securities class action lawsuits, most of which were part of a class action settlement of 32 lawsuits reached in 2007 and others of which have been settled subsequently, for which we were responsible for 31%. We are responsible for 31% of potential liabilities that may arise upon the resolution of the remaining pending litigation. Of the remaining securities cases, three remain outstanding, for which we have established a reserve. If the unresolved securities proceedings were to be determined adversely to Tyco International, our share of any additional potential losses under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which are not presently estimable, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Tyco International has the right to control the defense and settlement of outstanding securities litigation, subject to certain limitations. The timing, nature, and amount of any settlements of outstanding litigation may not be in our best interests. Furthermore, in the event of any future settlements, we may have limited notice before we would be required to pay our portion of the settlement amount. Moreover, Tyco International stipulated, pursuant to a court order, that we, Tyco International, and Covidien each will be primarily liable for a portion of the obligations arising from the Tyco International shareholder litigation. The stipulation also provides that if any party defaults on its obligations, the other parties are jointly and severally liable for the defaulting party's obligations. 20 Table of Contents We share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's and Covidien's income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns, certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments, and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. All the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses, including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from Tyco International, became our tax liabilities. Although we agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities. If Tyco International and Covidien default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities. If any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's tax liabilities. Our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. We are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that we have assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740 (Income Taxes) have been reflected as a liability on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. We recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International has the right to administer, control, and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. The timing, nature, and amount of any settlement agreed to by Tyco International may not be in our best interests. Moreover, the other parties to the Tax Sharing Agreement will be able to remove Tyco International as the controlling party only under limited circumstances, including a change of control or bankruptcy of Tyco International, or by a majority vote of the parties on or after the second anniversary of the 21 Table of Contents distribution. All other tax audits will be administered, controlled, and settled by the party that would be responsible for paying the tax. If the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Tyco International received private letter rulings from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the distribution of our common shares and Covidien common shares to the Tyco International shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution, except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of our common shares and the Covidien common shares, will qualify as tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). The private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the Code. In addition to obtaining the private letter rulings, Tyco International obtained opinions from the law firm of McDermott Will & Emery LLP confirming the tax-free status of the distribution and certain internal transactions. The private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings, from us, Tyco International, and Covidien regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution. If the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, Tyco International would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common shares and Covidien common shares distributed to Tyco International shareholders on the distribution date over Tyco International's tax basis in such common shares, but such gain, if recognized, generally would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, we would incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation should be treated as taxable transactions. In addition, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the distribution by us, Tyco International, or Covidien, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us, Tyco International, or Covidien as a result thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us, Tyco International, or Covidien, then we, Tyco International, or Covidien would be responsible for 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on us, Tyco International, or Covidien as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. In the event that any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting party's obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other party's taxes. Risks Relating to Our Swiss Jurisdiction of Incorporation Legislative and other proposals in Switzerland, the United States, and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate. Various U.S. and non-U.S. legislative proposals and other initiatives have been directed at companies incorporated in lower-tax jurisdictions. We believe that recently there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and other initiatives. If adopted, these proposed changes could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate. We believe that, since becoming a Swiss corporation in June 2009, we are less likely to be subject to such legislation and other initiatives 22 Table of Contents because Switzerland has both a generally imposed corporate income tax and comprehensive tax treaties with the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. However, we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation or initiative and we cannot assure you that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us. Legislation in the United States could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to U.S. companies that have moved to lower-tax jurisdictions. We expect the U.S. Congress to continue to consider implementation and/or expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that move their corporate locations abroad. We believe that we are less likely to be subject to such proposals since becoming a Swiss corporation in June 2009. However, we cannot predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business, or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. Therefore, we cannot assure you that any such legislative action will not apply to us. In addition, we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of our non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot assure you that the impact will not be materially adverse to us. As a Swiss corporation, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management. As a Swiss corporation, our board of directors may not declare and pay distributions or dividends on our shares without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements. Our articles of association authorize us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors, but this authorization is limited to (i) authorized share capital up to 50% of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years and (ii) conditional share capital of up to 50% of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital. Swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares, and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions, including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation, dividends, and/or voting. Moreover, under Swiss law, we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares. Any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders, which would delay the timing to execute such actions. Such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management. While we do not believe that Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management will have an adverse effect on us, we cannot assure you that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders. 23 Table of Contents Swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities. We are organized under the laws of Switzerland. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Some remedies available under the laws of United States jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as they are contrary to that nation's public policy. Swiss corporate law, which applies to us, differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers. Thus, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. Risks Relating to Our Shares The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely. The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including: our quarterly or annual earnings; changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by the global economic downturn and deterioration of credit conditions; changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates; changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; and the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies. We might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax. In order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of Swiss withholding tax, we anticipate making any future distributions to shareholders, prior to January 1, 2011, through a reduction of registered share capital or, after January 1, 2011, out of registered share capital or contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax purposes). Distributions to our shareholders in the form of a reduction of registered share capital are not subject to Swiss withholding tax. To date since we became a Swiss corporation, all distributions on our shares recommended by our board of directors for approval by our shareholders and approved by our shareholders have been distributions through reductions in our registered share capital. If we were to make future distributions to our shareholders through a dividend out of contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax purposes) rather than through a reduction of registered share capital prior to January 1, 2011, any dividends that we would 24 Table of Contents pay generally would be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%. The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or for a full refund if the shareholder is a qualified pension fund). A Swiss tax resident holder may apply any tax withheld for a full credit against Swiss income tax upon proper declaration of the related income in such Swiss resident holder's personal Swiss income tax return. There can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve distributions through reductions in our registered share capital in the future, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction of registered share capital, or that Swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future. In addition, over the long term, the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and the Swiss Franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax. Under Swiss corporate law, we are required to state our year-end unconsolidated Swiss statutory financial statements in Swiss Francs. Although distributions that are effected through a return of registered share capital or contributed surplus are expected to be paid in U.S. Dollars, shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions are required to be stated in Swiss Francs. If the U.S. Dollar were to increase in value relative to the Swiss Franc, the U.S. Dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without Swiss withholding tax will decrease. We have certain restrictions on our ability to repurchase our shares. The Swiss Code of Obligations limits a corporation's ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax purposes) are available. The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, only if the shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation. Registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings. Our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by Swiss law for Swiss companies like us that issue registered shares (as opposed to bearer shares). This provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights, holders of our shares must be registered in our share register (Aktienbuch) as shareholders with voting rights. Only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders' meetings, but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends, distributions, preemptive rights, advance subscription rights, and liquidation proceeds. The board of directors may, in its discretion, refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association. 25 Table of Contents Certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable. Our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered "anti-takeover" provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions, among others: shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent, and restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15% or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors, both of which provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of our issued voting shares, which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorably by our shareholders. Our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital (in either case, representing a maximum of 50% of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in the case of issuances from authorized capital, until June 22, 2011 unless re-authorized by shareholders for a subsequent two-year period) without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders' preemptive rights or advance subscription rights, for the purpose of the defense of an actual, threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid, in relation to which the board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial advisor, has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders. We note that Swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under Swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital. In addition, the New York Stock Exchange, on which our shares are listed, requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20% or more of the outstanding shares or voting power, with limited exceptions.
