Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 20-F. We caution you that our businesses and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. A. Operating Results We are one of the largest handset design and software solution providers based in China. Since our inception in 2002, we have been providing complete handset design services spanning the entire handset design cycle, which involves industrial design, hardware design, component selection and sourcing, prototype testing, pilot production and production support. While we design GSM-based mobile handsets based on major baseband technology platforms, we introduced our first 3G handset based on the WCDMA/GSM technology platform in the third quarter of 2005 and have re-allocated most of our GSM resources to focus on 3G handset design and development. We have also begun to develop smart phones. In June 2006, we and QUALCOMM formed TechSoft in China to develop software applications for wireless communication devices. We own 70% of TechSoft. From March 2006, we began to re-organize our business operations into three parts, which were (1) handset design, (2) sales of products and components, and (3) wireless software and applications. Products and components sold by us include feature phones, wireless modules and data cards, and smart phones that are in ODM model. The re-organization does not affect our financial reporting for prior fiscal years. The mobile handset industry is characterized by shortened product life cycles, increasing competition, margin pressure for wireless handset brand owners and a growing trend toward outsourcing. We expect our business to be primarily driven by the growing mobile handset markets and the industry trend to outsource the handset design function. We also expect our future revenue growth to be driven by our design contracts from new international customers and top Chinese customers and the expansion of our service offerings to cover handsets for sale internationally. Our gross margins have fluctuated since our inception and are expected to continue to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors. These factors include changes in the relative mix of our services and products and the terms at which we offer them. In order to maintain or improve our gross margin for our design services, we must reduce our unit cost through achieving greater economies of scale, particularly in the face of price pressures in a competitive market. We offer PCBs, wireless modules and other component products principally at cost, plus a margin. We also assist customers in procuring handset testing equipment. We offer these products and services principally for strategic purposes at a margin lower than that for our design services. For example, we sell PCBs as a means of determining our customers handset sales for calculating royalty payments under arrangements discussed in  Net Revenues below. Accordingly, to the extent the contribution of component sales to our net revenues increases, our blended gross margin will correspondingly decrease, in the absence of any other change. 25 Table of Contents Prior to 2006, we only designed but did not sell completed handsets. In response to customer demand, in 2006 we began selling completed smart phone handsets that we designed. We, however, did not manufacture smart phones ourselves, but outsourced the manufacturing to EMS providers. Sales of completed smart phones generate a lower gross margin than from design services only. In addition, as we believe demand for 3G handsets presents significant opportunity to us, we have re-allocated most of our GSM resources to focus on 3G programs beginning from the fourth quarter of 2005. As we halted two out of four GSM platforms, this impacted our revenues in 2006. We provide mobile handset design services to mobile handset brand owners. Our customers include leading Chinese mobile handset brand owners and international mobile handset brand owners. Although Chinese mobile handset customers fueled our initial growth, international brand owners have contributed to an increasing portion of our net revenues. We expect to increase the revenue contribution from international mobile handset customers by focusing our sales and marketing efforts to target international brand owners while retaining the top Chinese brand owners. Major Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations Net Revenues. We derive our revenues primarily from mobile handset design services, and sales of products and components, including handsets and smart phones designed by us and manufactured by EMS providers, printed circuit board assembles, or PCBAs, printed circuit boards, or PCBs, wireless modules and other electronics components for mobile handsets. Revenues from design services comprise design fees and royalty income. We recognize design fees as revenues only when a pre-agreed milestone has been reached. In general, three milestones are identified in our design contracts with customers. When the mobile handset design receives the approval verifying its conformity with applicable industry standards, in the case of GSM-based handsets, the full type approval, or FTA, for its conformity with GSM standards, we achieve the first milestone with respect to the design. When the mobile handset design receives regulatory approval for its use in the intended country, in the case of China, a China type approval, or CTA, we achieve the second milestone. When the customer accepts the mobile handset design and is ready to begin mass production of mobile handsets based on our design, we achieve the last milestone, which we refer to as shipping acceptance, or SA. In 2006, we began to expand our international customer base by developing handsets on new technology platforms. These international customers might not be subject to the PRC certification standards mentioned above, namely FTA and CTA. We have decided to use milestones agreed with these customers by contract, such as engineering prototype, semi-production and pilot production. Achievement of these milestones is independently verified by our customers before revenue is recognized. We generally charge a fixed price for our projects and recognize revenues based on percentage of completion of the project upon attaining pre-agreed milestones set forth in the agreement with the customer. We measure progress toward completion by reference to the total labor costs and direct project expenses incurred as of the time we reach a pre-agreed milestone, as compared to the total labor costs and direct project expenses we expect to incur for completing a design project through SA, the last milestone. We believe this measure of percentage of completion best reflects the value of the work completed as of the milestone. If actual labor costs and direct project expenses change after a milestone is reached, we adjust the cost of revenues for the period during which we know the facts that give rise to the change. If a milestone has not been reached, the associated cost is deferred and revenues are not recognized until the milestone has been achieved. We have entered into royalty arrangements with Chinese mobile handset brand owners and a limited number of international mobile handset brand owners, pursuant to which we charge a royalty in addition to the design fees described above. The royalty is calculated at a variable rate based on the volume of mobile handsets manufactured by a customer. In addition, beginning from the fourth quarter of 2004, some of our component suppliers and technology providers agreed to provide commissions to us for the use of their components and technology in our 26 Table of Contents designs, and we recognize such commissions as part of our royalty income when these component suppliers and technology providers confirm the amount of commissions. We recognize revenues from sales of products and components, including handsets and smart phones designed by us and manufactured by EMS providers, PCBAs, PCBs, wireless modules and other electronics components upon delivery of the products and components after all the risks and rights have passed to our customers. The customer orders the products and components from us. We then outsource the production of the products to outside manufacturers. We record the gross amounts billed to our customers as we are the primary obligor in these transactions as we have latitude in establishing prices, we are involved in the determination of the service specifications, we bear the credit risk, we bear the inventory risk and we have the right to select the suppliers. Normally, full payment is required before goods are shipped. We recognize revenue for goods shipped on credit only after collection is reasonably assured. Our net revenues from design fees and royalty income reflect deductions from our gross revenues for local business taxes incurred by our subsidiaries in China. Each of our subsidiaries in China is subject to a local business tax at an effective rate of 5% on revenues generated from services provided in China. We may, upon application to and approval from relevant tax authorities, be eligible for full refunds of the business taxes to the extent they related to the revenue generated under technology development agreements and/or technical marketing agreements. We have applied for and received refunds in connection with the revenues generated under several of our mobile handset design contracts. Our net revenues from sales of wireless modules, PCBs and other component products reflect deductions from our gross revenues for value-added taxes incurred by our subsidiaries in China. We are required to pay value added tax, or VAT, at a rate of 17% of the gross sales proceeds received by our PRC subsidiaries from such sales. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our design fees primarily consists of part of our engineers compensation and benefits for the period during which they are involved in any mobile handset design project, and, to a lesser extent, product warranty expenses, costs of materials used in making handset prototypes and depreciation and amortization of intangible assets including technology licenses and royalty rights used in connection with our design services. Cost of revenues for our royalty income normally is minimal. Cost of revenues from our sales of products, including smart phones, feature phones, PCBAs and wireless modules, consists primarily of the cost of acquiring the products from EMS factories, and to a lesser extent, compensation and benefits to our staff associated with the ODM business. Cost of revenues from sales of PCBs and other component products consists of the cost of acquiring PCBs and other component products from third parties, and cost incurred in connection with our assisting customers in installing testing equipment and lines for the testing of handsets before shipment. Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses consist of general and administrative, research and development and selling and marketing expenses and expenses related to impairment of acquired intangible assets. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits of administrative personnel, lease expenses for occupancy associated with administration, travel and other expenses for general and administrative purposes, as well as costs for professional services, including legal and accounting services. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of the portion of our engineers compensation and benefits not attributable to any mobile handset design project pursuant to a design contract, amortization of assets related to research and development, compensation and benefits to our engineers who are involved in the development of wireless modules, and lease expenses for occupancy associated with research and development. Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of expenses related to marketing and promotion activities, compensation and benefits for sales and marketing personnel and travel expenses of sales and marketing personnel. We expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute terms as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel and expand our selling and marketing network in Japan, Europe and North America to promote and sell our services. Income Taxes. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, where we are located, and the current laws of the British Virgin Islands, where our holding company and intermediate holding companies are located, we are not subject to tax on our income or capital gains. In addition, our payment of dividends is not subject to withholding tax in these jurisdictions. Under the current laws of China, the subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC are governed by the Income Tax Law of the PRC Concerning Foreign Investment Enterprises and Foreign Enterprises and various local income tax laws, or, collectively, the PRC Income Tax Laws. Pursuant to the PRC Income Tax Laws, the foreign investment 27 Table of Contents enterprises are subject to income tax on PRC taxable income at a statutory rate of 33% (comprising 30% for state income tax and 3% for local income tax) on PRC taxable income. However, preferential tax treatment as new and high technology companies has been agreed for Techfaith China, Techfaith Beijing, STEP Technologies and Techfaith Intelligent Handset Beijing with the relevant tax authorities and effective in 2003, 2003, 2004 and 2006 respectively. In accordance with the PRC Income Tax Laws, a new and high technology company is entitled to a preferential tax rate of 15% and are entitled to a three-year exemption from income tax, followed by a 50% reduction in tax rates for the succeeding three years. Techfaith Shanghai is qualified as productive enterprise and has been agreed with the relevant tax authorities for a two-year exemption from income tax, followed by a 50% reduction in tax rates for the succeeding three years effective 2005. The relevant tax authorities have agreed that Techfaith Shenzhen is also qualified as productive enterprise and is entitle to a two-year exemption from income tax, followed by a 50% reduction in tax rate for succeeding three years beginning from the first assessable profitable year. As a newly established company, the current income tax rate of Techfaith Wireless Communication Technology (Hangzhou) Limited, or Techfaith Hangzhou, is 26.4% as it is located in Hangzhou, which is a coastal city of open economy and enjoys certain tax incentives from the PRC government. As of December 31, 2006, TechSoft, a wholly owned subsidiary of Techsoft Holding is in the process of applying to the relevant tax authorities for the new and high technology status. Applicable laws and regulations in China specify certain financial and non-financial criteria for a company to be eligible for and maintain its status as a new and high technology enterprise. The status of our subsidiaries in China is re-assessed on a bi-annual basis. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our financial statements in conformity with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Significant accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements include revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, provision for inventory write-down, provision for warranty, useful lives and impairment for plant, machinery and equipment and intangible assets, share based compensation expense and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements as their application assists management in making their business decisions. Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are primarily derived from mobile handset design services and sales of products and components, which include the sales of smart phones, PCBAs, PCBs, wireless modules and other electronics components. We earn our revenue mainly through design fee, royalties, and sales of products. Design fee. Design fee is a fixed amount paid in installments according to pre-agreed milestones. In general, three milestones are identified in our design contracts with customers. When the mobile handset design receives the approval verifying its conformity with applicable industry standards, in the case of GSM-based handsets, the full type approval, or FTA, for its conformity with GSM standards, we achieve the first milestone with respect to the design. When the mobile handset design receives regulatory approval for its use in the intended country, in the case of China, a China type approval, or CTA, we achieve the second milestone. When the customer accepts the mobile handset design and is ready to begin mass production of mobile handsets based on our design, we achieve the last milestone, which we refer to as shipping acceptance, or SA. The handset design process normally includes hardware, software, mechanical engineering design, testing and quality assurance, pilot production, production support and other incidental support requested by customers. Because the software element of the handset has been deemed more than incidental for the handset design process taken as a whole, we recognize revenues in accordance with Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2. The handset design process requires significant production, development and customization of software, accordingly, as prescribed by SOP97-2 revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method in accordance with SOP81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Performance Type Contracts. We recognize revenue only upon achievement of each milestone (i.e. FTA, CTA and SA), which is consistent with the use of an output measure. The milestones can vary depending on the customers requirements. The percentage of completion designated for each milestone, however, is the percentage that would be obtained by using an input measure (i.e. labor hours and other relevant costs incurred). We believe that designating the percentage of completion for each milestone based on labor hours and other relevant costs incurred, as opposed to by reference to the amounts that become billable at the milestone, is more reflective of the progress completed through the date of the milestone. In the event that a milestone has not 28 Table of Contents been reached, the associated cost is deferred and revenue is not recognized until the milestone has been achieved and/or accepted by the customer. In 2006, we began to expand our international customer base by developing handsets on new technology platforms. These international customers might not subject to the PRC certification standards mentioned above, namely FTA and CTA, but the pre-agreed milestones stipulated by contract, such as engineering prototype or EP, semi-production or SP and pilot production or PP. Achievement of these milestones is independently verified by customers before revenue is recognized. Royalty. In addition to design fee, we also charge royalty to certain customers. The royalty is calculated at a variable rate based on the volume of mobile handsets manufactured or sold by a customer. Royalty income is recognized when the confirmation of manufacturing or selling volume is obtained from customers. Product and component sales. Revenue from sales of products and components, including handsets and smart phones designed by us and manufactured by EMS providers, PCBAs, PCBs, wireless modules and other electronics components is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured, and in the period in which delivery or performance has occurred. Results of Operations The following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated. Our business has evolved rapidly and significantly since we commenced operations in July 2002. Our limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results very difficult. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as being indicative of future performance. For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In thousands) Consolidated Statement of Operations Data Net revenues: Design fees $ 29,495 $ 63,020 $ 29,864 Royalty income 6,961 15,651 7,674 Component and product sales 10,104 11,439 43,266 Total net revenues $ 46,560 $ 90,110 $ 80,804 Cost of revenues: Design fees $ 10,951 $ 26,258 $ 19,998 Royalty income 725   Component and product sales 8,208 8,803 35,107 Total cost of revenues $ 19,884 $ 35,061 $ 55,105 Gross profit: Design fees $ 18,544 $ 36,762 $ 9,866 Royalty income 6,236 15,651 7,674 Component and product sales 1,896 2,636 8,159 Total gross profit $ 26,676 $ 55,049 $ 25,699 Operating expenses: General and administrative $ (4,771 ) $ (9,574 ) $ (15,110 ) Research and development (2,506 ) (3,447 ) (21,970 ) Selling and marketing (694 ) (1,269 ) (2,260 ) Leasehold improvement impairment   (1,388 ) Total operating expenses $ (7,971 ) $ (14,290 ) $ (40,728 ) Other operating income   180 Income (loss) from operations $ 18,705 $ 40,759 $ (14,849 ) Total other income (loss), net (484 ) 2,149 4,741 Income taxes  (54 ) (100 ) Minority interests 23 (1,469 ) 1,808 Equity in loss of an affiliate   (393 ) Net (loss) income $ 18,244 $ 41,385 $ (8,793 ) 29 Table of Contents Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2005 and the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net Revenues Our net revenues decreased by 10.3% from US$90.1 million in 2005 to US$80.8 million in 2006. The decrease was primarily attributable to a substantial decrease in net revenues from design fees and, to a much lesser extent, decreases in net revenues from royalty income, offset by an increase in net revenues from products sales. Design Fees. Our net revenues from design fees decreased substantially by 52.6% from US$63.0 million in 2005 to US$29.9 million in 2006 because of a significant decrease in our wireless handset design service revenues from our international customers in 2006 compared to 2005. Royalty Income. Our royalty income decreased by 51.0% from US$15.7 million in 2005 to US$7.7 million in 2006. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in our royalty revenues from our domestic customers in 2006 compared to 2005. Component and Product Sales. Revenues from our component and product sales increased by 278.2% from US$11.4 million in 2005 to US$43.3 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to the commencement of our sales of smart phone in 2006 and, to a lesser extend, the commencement of our sales of PCBAs in 2006. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues increased substantially by 57.2% from US$35.1 million in 2005 to US$55.1 million in 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in cost of revenues for products sales which had a lower margin, slightly offset by a decrease in cost of revenues for design fees. Design Fees. Cost of revenues for design fees decreased by 23.8% from US$26.3 million in 2005 to US$20.0 million in 2006, primarily as a result of the substantial decrease in revenues from design fee. Royalty Income. We did not incur any cost of revenues for royalty income in both 2006 and 2005. Component and Product Sales. Cost of revenues for component and product sales increased substantially from US$8.8 million in 2005 to US$35.1 million in 2006. The increase was due primarily to the substantial increases in products sales from 2005 to 2006. Gross Profit Our gross profit was US$25.7 million in 2006, compared to US$55.0 million in 2005, representing gross margins of 31.8% and 61.1%, respectively. Design Fees. Our gross profit for design fees was US$9.9 million in 2006, compared to US$36.8 million in 2005, representing gross margins of 33.0% and 58.3%, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of a decrease in the average design fee per project and the decrease in the number of projects in 2006 as compared to 2005. Royalty Income. Our gross profit for royalty income was US$7.7 million in 2006, compared to US$15.7 million in 2005, representing gross margins of 100% and 100%, respectively. Component and Product Sales. Our gross profit from component and product Sales was US$8.2 million in 2006, compared to US$2.6 million in 2005, representing gross margins of 18.9% and 23.0%, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of lower margin contribution from selling smart phones and CDMA-based wireless modules. Operating Expenses Operating expenses increased substantially from US$14.3 million in 2005 to US$40.7 million in 2006. The increase was due primarily to an increase in research and development and, to a lesser extent, increases in general and administrative expenses and selling and marketing expenses. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased from US$9.6 million in 2005 to US$15.1 million in 2006. The increase was due primarily to recording allowance for doubtful account and exchange loss due to the depreciation of U.S. Dollar. 30 Table of Contents Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased substantially from US$3.4 million in 2005 to US$22.0 million in 2006. The increase was due primarily to our continuous investment in emerging technologies and development in smart phone products. Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 78.1% from US$1.3 million in 2005 to US$2.3 million in 2006. The increase was due primarily to the increase in our selling and marketing staff and activities as we expanded our efforts to market and sell our services. Leasehold Improvement Impairment. Leasehold improvement impairment was US$1.4 million in 2006, compared to nil in 2005. The impairment was due to the moving of our offices from premises that we leases to premises that we acquired. Other Operating Income We recorded an other operating income of US$0.2 million in 2006 as compared to nil in 2005. The other operating income was due to subsidy granted by government. Other Income (Loss), Net We recorded other income, net of US$4.8 million in 2006 as compared to other income, net of US$2.1 million in 2005, primarily due to an increase in interest income and decrease in expenses related to change in the fair value of put and call option. Net Income As a result of the cumulative effect of the foregoing factors, we incurred a net loss of US$8.8 million in 2006, while we recorded a net income of US$41.4 million in 2005. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2004 and the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Revenues Our net revenues increased substantially by 93.5% to US$90.1 million in 2005 from US$46.6 million in 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in net revenues from design fees and, to a much lesser extent, increases in net revenues from component products and royalty income. Design Fees. Our net revenues from design fees increased substantially to US$63.0 million in 2005 from US$29.5 million in 2004 because of a significant growth of our wireless handset design service business. In 2005, a total of 123 designs contributed to our design fee revenues, 77 of our mobile handset designs achieved the FTA milestone, 72 of our mobile handset designs achieved the CTA milestone, and 80 of our mobile handset designs achieved the SA milestone. In contrast, in 2004, a total of 58 handset designs contributed to our design fee revenues, 69 mobile handsets designed by us reached the FTA milestone, 62 mobile handsets designed by us achieved the CTA milestone and 55 mobile handsets designed by us achieved the SA milestone. Royalty Income. Our royalty income increased substantially by 124.8% to US$15.7 million in 2005 from US$7.0 million in 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the continuous completion of handset design projects throughout 2005. Component Products. Revenues from sales of our component products increased by 13.2% to US$11.4 million in 2005 from US$10.1 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to our recent entrance into the CDMA wireless modules market. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues increased substantially by 76.3% to US$35.1 million in 2005 from US$19.9 million in 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in cost of revenues for design fees due to the increased number of projects completed during the period and, to a much lesser extent, a small increase in cost of revenues for component products. Design Fees. Cost of revenues for design fees increased substantially to US$26.3 million in 2005 from US$11.0 million in 2004, primarily as a result of increased compensation and benefits allocated to engineers who worked on design projects in 2005. Royalty Income. We did not incur any cost of revenues for royalty income in 2005. 31 Table of Contents Component Products. Cost of revenues for component products increased slightly by 7.3% to US$8.8 million in 2005 from US$8.2 million in 2004. The increase was due primarily to the increases in sales of component products in 2005. Gross Profit Our gross profit was US$55.0 million in 2005, compared to US$26.7 million in 2004, representing gross margins of 61.1% and 57.3%, respectively. Design Fees. Our gross profit for design fees was US$36.8 million in 2005, compared to US$18.5 million in 2004, representing gross margins of 58.3% and 62.9%, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of a decrease in the average design fee per project in 2005 as compared to 2004. Royalty Income. Our gross profit for royalty income was US$15.7 million in 2005, compared to US$6.2 million in 2004, representing gross margins of 100% and 89.6%, respectively. The increase in gross margin was because we did not incur any cost of revenues for royalty income in 2005. Component Products. Our gross profit from the sale of component products was US$2.6 million in 2005, compared to US$1.9 million in 2004, representing gross margins of 23.0% and 18.8%, respectively. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of higher margin contribution from selling CDMA-based wireless modules. Operating Expenses Operating expenses increased by 79.3% to US$14.3 million in 2005 from US$8.0 million in 2004. The increase was due to increases in general and administrative expenses and selling and marketing expenses and, to a lesser extent, an increase in research and development. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased to US$9.6 million in 2005 from US$4.8 million in 2004. The increase was due primarily to a substantial increase in our administrative personnel as we continued to grow our business, increase in professional service fees as a newly listed company, and to a lesser extent, an increase in rental costs as we leased new office space for administrative use. The increase was also attributable to recording allowance for doubtful account. Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased by 37.6% to US$3.4 million in 2005 from US$2.5 million in 2004. The increase was due primarily to our continuous investment in emerging technologies. Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 82.9% to US$1.3 million in 2005 from US$0.7 million in 2004. The increase was due primarily to the increase in our selling and marketing staff and activities as we expanded our efforts to market and sell our services. Total Other Income (Loss), Net We recorded a total other net income of US$2.1 million in 2005 as compared to total other net loss of US$0.5 million in 2004, primarily due to an increase in interest income and partially offset by a negative change in fair value of call option. Net Income Our net income increased to US$41.4 million in 2005 from US$18.2 million in 2004 as a result of the cumulative effect of the foregoing factors. B. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 25,809 $ 16,950 $ 5,434 Net cash used in investing activities (8,112 ) (5,529 ) (30,212 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 9,700 89,259 (1,953 ) Effect of exchange rate changes (10 ) 1,441 2,696 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 27,387 102,121 (24,035 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 7,699 35,086 137,207 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 35,086 $ 137,207 $ 113,172 32 Table of Contents We have financed our operations through cash generated from our operating activities and securities issuances, including our initial public offering in May 2005. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we had US$113.2 million and US$137.2 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand and bank deposits with terms of three months or less. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next twelve months. We may, however, require additional cash resources beyond the next twelve months due to higher than expected growth in our business or other changing business conditions or future developments, including any possible investments or acquisitions. If our existing cash resources are insufficient to meet our requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity securities, debt securities or borrow from banks. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The sale of additional securities, including convertible debt securities, would result in additional dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. If we are unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing as required, our business, operations and prospects may suffer. The ability of our subsidiaries in China to convert RMB into U.S. dollars and make payments to us is subject to PRC foreign exchange regulations. Under these regulations, RMB is convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, security investment and repatriation of investment, however, is still subject to the approval of relevant PRC government authorities. TechFaith is a holding company and has no present plan to pay any cash dividends on its ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. See Item 8.A. of this annual report on Form 20-F, Financial Information ¾ Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information ¾ Dividend Policy. Nor does TechFaith have any loans or any other outstanding debts. Each of our operating subsidiaries in China fulfils its own cash obligations. Accordingly, we believe that the impact of PRC foreign exchange regulations on Techfaiths ability to meet its cash obligations is minimal. Operating Activities. Net cash provided from operating activities decreased substantially from US$17.0 million in 2005 to US$5.4 million in 2006, due to the decrease in revenue, the increase in cost of revenues and operating expenses. Net cash provided from operating activities decreased substantially to US$17.0 million in 2005 from US$25.8 million in 2004. The decrease was due primarily to a substantial increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in advance from customers in 2005. In connection with our design services, our customers typically pay us a portion of design fees immediately after the design contract is executed. We account such fees as deferred revenue only until a pre-agreed milestone has been reached. Deferred revenue increased fromUS$1.8 million in 2005 to US$5.4million in 2006. The increase was mainly due to the upfront design fees paid by one international customer. Due to the increasing competition among mobile handset design houses, the percentage of the upfront design fees to the total design fees paid to us by our customers in connection with a mobile handset design project was smaller in 2005 as compared to 2004. As a result, the amount of deferred revenue decreased by 87.9% to US$1.8 million in 2005 from US$15.2 million in 2004 even though design fee revenues increased by 113.7% during the same period. In connection with sales of products and components, our customers typically pay us a portion of the selling price before the products and components are delivered. We account for such prepayment as advance from customers until all the risks and rights associated with the products and the components have been passed to our customers. Advance from customers increased fromUS$0.4 million in 2005 to US$5.2million in 2006. The increase was due primarily to the increase in sales of products in 2006. Our accounts receivable amounted to US$7.8 million, US$34.1 million and US$37.2 million as of December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Our inventories amounted to US$5.0 million, US$5.0 million and US$8.5 million as of December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities substantially increased from US$5.5 million in 2005 to US$30.2 million in 2006. The substantial increase in our investing activities in 2006 was due primarily to investment in an affiliate and purchase of fixed assets. Net cash used in investing activities decreased to US$5.5 million in 2005 from US$8.1 million in 2004. Our investing activities in 2005 primarily consist of the purchase of plant, machinery and equipment and intangible assets. Our investing activities in 2004 primarily consist of the purchase of plant, machinery and equipment and the purchase of intangible assets for our mobile handset design business. 33 Table of Contents Financing Activities. Net cash used by financing activities was US$2.0 million in 2006 while net cash provided by financing activities was US$89.3 million in 2005. This change in 2006 was primarily due to US$3.0 million capital contribution provided by Qualcomm and US$4.6 million used in repurchasing our ordinary shares from the open market. Net cash provided by financing activities increased significantly to US$89.3 million in 2005 from US$9.7 million in 2004. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2005 primarily consisted of net proceeds received from our initial public offering in May 2005. Net cash provided by financing activities was US$9.7 million in 2004, primarily consisting of US$10.0 million from net issuance of interest-free convertible notes to three strategic investors in April 2004. Our capital expenditures amounted to US$6.2 million, US$9.4 million and US$23.8 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Our historical capital expenditure consisted principally of purchases of software, machinery, equipment and other items related to our mobile handset design services. We incurred capital expenditures totaling approximately US$23.8 million in 2006, which primarily consisted of plant and machinery, leasehold improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment. Our capital expenditure plans for 2007 have not yet been fixed, but we expect to spend approximately RMB149.0 million (US$19.1 million), primarily for acquiring premises in Beijing and Hangzhou. On March 23, 2006, we entered into contracts to purchase six floors in a commercial building in Beijing for an aggregate consideration of approximately RMB89.8 million (US$11.5 million). Under these contracts, we are required to pay the seller of the property RMB50 million (US$6.4 million) by July 30, 2006 and the remainder by January 10, 2007. On February 11, 2007, we have entered into a contract to construct a building in Hangzhou for a provisional consideration of approximately RMB80.0 million (US$10.2 million). Under this contract, we have paid RMB40 million (US$5.1 million) in the first quarter of 2007 and will pay the remainder according to the progress of the construction. C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc. See Item 4.B. Information on the Company ¾ Business Overview. D. Trend Information Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events for the period from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006 that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that caused the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions. E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any outstanding off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency forward contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. F. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: Payment Due by Period Less Than 1 1-3 3-5 More Than 5 Contractual Obligations Total Year Years Years Years (In thousands of $) Operating lease obligations 1,195 740 455   Purchase obligations (1) 1,700 1,197 503   Total 2,895 1,937 958   (1) Purchase obligations relating to the purchase of plant, machinery and equipment. Other than the contractual obligations set forth above, we do not have any long-term commitments. 34 Table of Contents G. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. Our risk exposure from changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest income generated by excess cash invested in short term bank deposits. Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. We have not been nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk. Substantially all of our revenues and substantially all our cost of revenues are denominated in RMB, with an immaterial portion of our cost of revenues denominated in the U.S. dollar, for which we have not incurred any material foreign exchange gains or losses. In 2006, we invested US$39 million in Techfaith Hangzhou and TechSoft in China. As of December 31, 2006, we had U.S currency deposit of US$39 million in China. Our exchange losses were US$1.2 million in 2006 due to the U.S currency deposited in China. We believe that we currently have significant direct foreign exchange risk. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy has resulted in a greater fluctuation range between Renminbi and the U.S. dollar. For example, the daily fluctuation range between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar reached 160 basis points, or 0.16%, on September 15, 2006. From July 21, 2005 to June 25, 2007, the Renminbi cumulatively appreciated approximately 8.0% over the U.S. dollar. While the international reaction to the RMB revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. Any significant revaluation of RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings and financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our ADS in U.S. dollars. For example, an appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar would make any new RMB denominated investments or expenditures more costly to us, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for such purposes. H. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the companys choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first 120 days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of Statement 157. We are currently evaluating whether the adoption of SFAS 159 will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In September 2006, the Financial accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. This standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. The standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 12, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS157 will have a material effect on its results of operations and financial conditions. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with early adoption permitted. We adopted FIN48 in the first quarter of 2007 and it did not have any material effect on our results of operations and financial conditions. 35 Table of Contents Item 6.

A total of 40,000,000 ordinary shares have been reserved for issuance under the 2005 plan, under which 131,636 options and 578,272 restricted shares were issued as of June 25, 2007. Our future grants of share incentives will be made pursuant to the 2005 plan. The following table summarizes, as of June 25, 2007, the outstanding options granted under our 2005 Plan to our directors and senior executive officer named below since our board of directors adopted the 2005 Plan.

The following paragraphs describe the principal terms of the 2005 plan. Types of Awards. We may grant the following types of awards under our 2005 plan: § our ordinary shares; § options to purchase our ordinary shares; § restricted shares, which are non-transferable ordinary shares, subject to forfeiture upon termination of a grantees employment or service; § restricted share units, which represent the right to receive our ordinary shares at a specified date in the future, subject to forfeiture upon termination of a grantees employment or service; § share appreciation rights, which provide for the payment to the grantee based upon increases in the price of our ordinary shares over a set base price; and § dividend equivalent rights, which represent the value of the dividends per share that we pay. Awards may be designated in the form of ADSs instead of ordinary shares. If we designate an award in the form of ADSs, the number of shares issuable under the 2005 plan will be adjusted to reflect that one ADS represents 15 ordinary shares. Plan Administration. Our board of directors, or a committee designated by our board or directors, will administer the 2005 plan. The committee or the full board of directors, as appropriate, will determine the provisions and terms and conditions of each award grant. Award Agreement. Awards granted under our 2005 option plan are evidenced by an award agreement that sets forth the terms, conditions and limitations for each award. In addition, in the case of options, the award agreement also specifies whether the option constitutes an incentive stock option, or ISO, or a non-qualifying stock option. 39 Table of Contents Eligibility. We may grant awards to employees, directors and consultants of our company or any of our related entities, which include our subsidiaries or any entities in which we hold a substantial ownership interest. However, we may grant options that are intended to qualify as ISOs only to our employees. Acceleration of Awards upon Corporate Transactions. The outstanding awards will accelerate upon occurrence of a change-of-control corporate transaction where the successor entity does not assume our outstanding awards under the 2005 plan. In such event, each outstanding award will become fully vested and immediately exercisable, and the transfer restrictions on the awards will be released and the repurchase or forfeiture rights will terminate immediately before the date of the change-of-control transaction. If the successor entity assumes our outstanding awards and later terminates the grantees service without cause within 12 months of the change-of-control transaction, the outstanding awards will automatically become fully vested and exercisable. Terms of Awards. In general, the plan administrator determines the exercise price of an option or the purchase price of the restricted shares and sets forth the price in the award agreement. The exercise price may be a fixed or variable price related to the fair market value of our ordinary shares. If we grant an ISO to an employee, who, at the time of that grant, owns shares representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of our share capital, the exercise price cannot be less than 110% of the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the date of that grant. The term of each award shall be stated in the award agreement. The term of an award shall not exceed 10 years from the date of the grant. Vesting Schedule. In general, the plan administrator determines, or the award agreement specifies, the vesting schedule. Amendment and Termination. Our board of directors may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the 2005 plan. Amendments to the 2005 plan are subject to shareholder approval to the extent required by law, or stock exchange rules or regulations. Additionally, shareholder approval is specifically required to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the 2005 plan or to extend the term of an option beyond 10 years. Unless terminated earlier, the 2005 plan will expire and no further awards may be granted after the tenth anniversary of the shareholder approval of the 2005 plan. C. Board Practices In 2006, our directors held meetings or passed resolutions by unanimous written consent four times. Each director participated in all the meetings of our board and its committees on which he served after becoming a member of our board. No director is entitled to any severance benefits upon termination of his directorship with us. As of the date of this report, a majority of our directors meet the independence definition under The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. Marketplace Rules, or the Nasdaq Rules. Due to Mr. Peter Clarkes resignation in August 2006, we received a Nasdaq Staff Deficiency Letter on August 18, 2006 indicating that we failed to comply with the majority independent board and three-member audit committee requirements set forth in Marketplace Rules 4350(c) and 4350(d)(2) during the short interim period between Mr. Clarkes resignation and August 18, 2006. The same letter also states that we have regained compliance with Marketplace Rules as a result of the subsequent appointment of Dr. Lu later in August 2006. Committees of the Board of Directors Audit Committee . Our audit committee reports to the board regarding the appointment of our independent auditors, the scope of the annual audits, the fees paid to our independent auditors, the results of our annual audits, compliance with our accounting and financial policies and managements procedures, policies relatively to the adequacy of our internal accounting controls, and pre-approval of non-audit services to us rendered by our independent auditors. In 2006, our audit committee held four meetings. Our audit committee currently consists of Messrs. Ken Lu and Robert Chen and Ms. Ying Han, all of whom meet the audit committee independence standard under Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act. Each of them also meets the independence definition under Rule 4200 of the Nasdaq Rules. Mr. Ken Lu and Ms. Ying Han are financial experts as defined under the Nasdaq Rules. Compensation Committee . Our compensation committee reviews and evaluates and, if necessary, revises the compensation policies adopted by the management. Our compensation committee also determines all forms of compensation to be provided to our three most senior executive officers. In addition, the compensation committee reviews all annual bonuses, long-term incentive compensation, share options, employee pension and welfare benefit plans. Our Chief Executive Officer may not be present at any committee meeting during which his compensation is deliberated. 40 Table of Contents Our compensation committee currently consists of Messrs. Hui (Tom) Zhang and Hung Hsin (Robert) Chen, both of whom meet the independence definition under The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. Marketplace Rules. In 2006, our compensation committee held four meetings. Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee . Our corporate governance and nominating committee assists our board of directors in identifying individuals qualified to become our directors and in determining the composition of the board and its committees. The corporate governance and nominating committee monitor compliance with the code of business conduct and ethics and applicable laws and practice of corporate governance. Our corporate governance and nominating committee currently consists of Messrs. Hui (Tom) Zhang and Hung Hsin (Robert) Chen, both of whom meet the independence definition under the Nasdaq Rules. In 2006, our corporate governance and nominating committee held three meetings. Duties of Directors Under Cayman Islands laws, our directors have a statutory duty to act honestly in good faith with a view to our best interests. Our directors also have a duty to exercise the skill they actually possess and such care and diligence that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. In fulfilling their duty of care to us, our directors must ensure compliance with our memorandum and articles of association. A shareholder has the right to seek damages if a duty owed by our directors is breached. Terms of Directors and Officers All directors hold office until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. A director may only be removed by our shareholders. Officers are elected by and serve at the discretion of the board of directors. D. Employees As of December 31, 2006, we had 2,324 employees, including 2,128 in research and development and supportive function, 73 in selling and marketing and 123 in management and administration. The number of our employees was subsequently reduced to 1,504 by May 2007 due to an organizational restructuring. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. E. Share Ownership As of both December 31, 2006 and June 25, 2007, 649,692,954 ordinary shares of our company were outstanding, excluding shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options. Our shareholders are entitled to vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to shareholders vote. No shareholder has different voting rights from other shareholders. We are not aware of any arrangement that may, at a subsequent date, result in a change of control of our company.

Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions A. Major Shareholders Please refer to Item 6.E. Directors, Senior Management and Employees  Share Ownership. B. Related Party Transactions 42 Table of Contents Issuance and Sale of Convertible Notes In April 2004, TechFaith BVI issued interest-free notes in the aggregate principal amount of US$14 million to HTF 7 Limited, QUALCOMM, SeaBright China Special Opportunities (I) Limited and Intel Capital Corporation, pursuant to a Note Subscription and Rights Agreement, or Subscription Agreement. The notes were convertible into our ordinary shares at any time with the initial conversion price of approximately US$0.21 per share, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement. Upon completion of our initial public offering on May 11, 2005, the notes were automatically converted into our ordinary shares pursuant to the then effective conversion price. We have granted the original holders of the notes customary registration rights, including demand and piggyback registration rights and Form F-3 registration rights. Set forth below are more detailed description of the registration rights. Demand Registration Rights . At any time commencing six months after our companys initial public offering, holders of a majority of the registrable securities have the right to demand that we file a registration statement covering the offer and sale of their securities, except other than pursuant to a registration statement on Form F-4 or S-8, so long as the aggregate amount of securities to be sold under the registration statement exceeds $5.0 million. However, we are not obligated to effect any such demand registration if we have within the six month period preceding the demand already effected a registration or if such holders had an opportunity to be included in a registration pursuant to their piggyback registration rights. We have the ability to delay or withdraw the filing of a registration statement for up to ninety days if our board of directors determines there is a valid business reason to delay such filing. We are not obligated to effect such demand registrations on more than two occasions. Form F-3 Registration Rights . Upon our company becoming eligible for use of Form F-3, holders of a majority of the registrable securities have the right to request we file a registration statement under Form F-3. Such requests for registrations are not counted as demand registrations. Piggyback Registration Rights . If, at any time after our companys initial public offering, we propose to file a registration statement with respect to an offering for our own account, then we must offer each holder of the registrable securities the opportunity to include their shares in the registration statement, other than pursuant to a registration statement on Form F-4 or S-8. We must use our reasonable best efforts to cause the underwriters in any underwritten offering to permit any such shareholder who so requests to include their shares on the same terms and conditions as the securities of our company. Expenses of Registration . We will pay all expenses relating to any demand or piggyback registration, whether or not such registrations become effective; except, shareholders shall bear the expense of any brokers commission or underwriters discount or commission relating to registration and sale of their securities, and shall bear the fees and expenses of their own counsel. Transactions with QUALCOMM In December 2003, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with QUALCOMM to confirm mutual intentions and understandings regarding the establishment of a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company to engage solely in CDMA-related business. Pursuant to this memorandum of understanding, we established TechFaith Shanghai in March 2004 and entered into several license agreements with QUALCOMM for the development of CDMA 1X mobile phones. Under these license agreements, we have obtained a non-exclusive license to manufacture, use and sell CDMA cards and components using certain intellectual property of QUALCOMM. In addition, we have obtained QUALCOMMs technical support for certain particular process technologies and design platforms. 43 Table of Contents In March 2006, QUALCOMM and we entered into a joint venture by incorporating a Cayman Islands holding company named TechFaith Software (China) Holding Limited. QUALCOMM and we hold 30% and 70%, respectively, of this holding companys shares. In June 2006, TechFaith Software (China) Holding Limited formed a company, TechSoft, in China to develop application software for wireless devices. Pursuant to an agreement entered into on March 22, 2006 in relation to this joint venture with QUALCOMM, TechSoft will receive a total of US$35 million in funding by QUALCOMM and us. The US$35 million will comprise US$20 million in cash and US$15 million in non-cash in-kind contributions. TechSoft will be based in Beijing and Hangzhou, China. We became QUALCOMMs first independent handset design house partner in China, following an investment announced in April 2004. Initially focusing on 3G CDMA mobile handsets, TechSoft will operate as an independent entity. Transactions with NEC On September 26, 2003, we entered into a joint venture agreement with NEC for the establishment of STEP Technologies, which was formed in November 2003. We contributed US$4.2 million and NEC contributed US$1.8 million as the registered capital of STEP Technologies, in return for a 70% and 30%, respectively, equity interest in STEP Technologies. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement, NECs consent is required for certain matters of STEP Technologies, including amendment of the articles of association, profit distribution or loss treatment, sale or transfer of intangible assets, and investment in any other entity. On March 30, 2007, Techfaith BVI entered into a share transfer agreement with NEC to purchase the 30% equity interest in STEP Technologies held by NEC. After the acquisition, STEP Technologies has become our wholly-owned subsidiary. Since March 2003, we have entered into several business contracts with Wuhan NEC, a PRC subsidiary of NEC, pursuant to which we have provided mobile handset design services to Wuhan NEC. In 2003, 2004 and 2005, we derived net revenue of approximately US$4.1 million, US$14.9 million and US$40.6 million, respectively, from these business contracts. We entered into additional business contracts with NEC and its subsidiaries after completion of our initial public offering. In June 2004, we entered into a written agreement with Wuhan NEC, with respect to a mobile handset model we designed for and accepted by Wuhan NEC in December 2003. Under the agreement, we were required to pay Wuhan NEC US$1.5 million by October 29, 2004 to compensate its losses allegedly arising from the delay in the design schedule, certain software quality problems and changes of the initial design in the design process. At the time of execution of the agreement, it was the mutual understanding of both parties that Wuhan NEC would terminate the agreement and all of our obligations thereunder if the sales of the two new models of mobile handsets designed by us were satisfactory to Wuhan NEC. The sales of the two new models in September and October 2004 were satisfactory to Wuhan NEC and accordingly, Wuhan NEC orally agreed to terminate the agreement and all of our obligations thereunder in October 2004. We and Wuhan NEC entered into a new written agreement in December 2004 to affirm our previous oral agreements, clarify that the design quality issues were attributable to the components supplied by a third party and declare the June 2004 agreement to be void and ineffective from the date thereof. Transactions with SEF Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Defu Dong, co-founded Beijing Sino-Electronics Future Telecommunication R&D, Ltd., or SEF, a mobile handset design house, in February 2001. He was a director, shareholder and the Chief Executive Officer of SEF from its inception until July 2002. Mr. Wensheng Tan is, and was at all relevant times, a shareholder of both our company and SEF. On September 18, 2003, Lenovo, SEF and TechFaith China entered into an agreement pursuant to which SEF assigned to TechFaith China and TechFaith China assumed without payment all the rights and obligations under three product technology development cooperation agreements entered into between Lenovo and SEF. Under the assignment and novation agreement, SEF agreed to act as a guarantor of the obligations of TechFaith China and continue to observe certain restrictions. On October 20, 2003, TechFaith China and SEF entered into five transfer agreements pursuant to which SEF agreed to transfer to TechFaith China without consideration three patents and two patent applications that were principally developed by some employees of SEF who subsequently joined TechFaith China. On January 18, 2004, SEF, TechFaith China and Skyworks Solutions entered into an agreement pursuant to which SEF assigned to TechFaith China all the rights under an April 2002 development and license agreement between SEF and Skyworks Solutions in return for TechFaith Chinas payment of US$0.3 million to SEF. The 44 Table of Contents consideration was determined based on the remaining pro rata share of the total license fee previously paid by SEF to Skyworks Solutions for the five year license period. We entered into a lease agreement dated July 31, 2003 with SEF with respect to part of our premises in Beijing. Our lease with SEF expired in December 2005 when the ownership of the property was transferred to another company. During the term of our lease, we were required to pay SEF a quarterly rent of US$34,177. In 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, we reimbursed SEF an aggregate amount of US$0.55 million, US$nil million, US$nil million and US$nil, respectively, for certain staff remuneration that SEF paid on behalf of our company before we established our statutory employee welfare reserve system under PRC law. Transactions with Beijing Qidi Transfer of Mobile Handset Design Contracts. We previously owned a 49% interest in Beijing Qidi, a company formed in September 2002 to provide wireless solutions to wireless manufacturers and brand owners in China. We sold our equity interest in Beijing Qidi to another shareholder of Beijing Qidi unrelated to us for US$1.2 million in September 2003. On December 5, 2003, Guangzhou Rowa Communication Company Limited, or Rowa, Beijing Qidi and TechFaith China entered into an agreement pursuant to which Beijing Qidi assigned and novated to TechFaith China, effective from January 1, 2004, all the rights and obligations under a mobile handset project cooperation agreement dated June 20, 2003 entered into between Rowa and Beijing Qidi, whereby Rowa engaged Beijing Qidi to design mobile handsets and agreed to pay Beijing Qidi design fees and royalties for its design services.

TechFaith China did not make any payment to Beijing Qidi in connection with this assignment. Settlement with CECW. In September 2003, CECW, one of our competitors, sued Beijing Qidi, a former affiliate, and 18 individuals, including our director Baozhuang Huo, a former hardware design manager at CECW, in the Beijing First Intermediate Peoples Court, claiming that Beijing Qidi and the individuals had engaged in unfair competition. In December 2003, CECW also initiated arbitration proceedings against four individuals, including Mr. Huo, claiming that these individuals had violated the non-competition restrictions set forth in their respective employment agreements with CECW. In January 2004, we settled these claims with CECW on behalf of Beijing Qidi, Mr. Huo and the other individuals involved. In connection with the settlement, Beijing Qidi assigned three mobile handset project cooperation agreements to us. CECW subsequently withdrew all of its claims, and the litigation and arbitration were dismissed. Mr. Huo and several other individuals involved in the litigation joined our company in January 2004. The settlement was recorded as cost for the acquisition of intangible assets in our financial statements in 2004 at its cost, which estimated the fair market value of the intangible assets acquired in exchange for the settlement of this claim. Transactions with an Employee In 2005, we sold component products to a corporate customer, in which 30% of shareholding is owned by an employee of the Group. Total net revenues from this corporate customer amounted to US$1,622 and nil for 2005 and 2006, respectively, and the related accounts receivable as of December 31, 2005 and 2006 was US$1,622 and nil, respectively.

In the future, these companies could engage in business with us.
