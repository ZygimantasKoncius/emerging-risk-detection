D. Risk Factors The securities of Quartz are highly speculative and subject to a number of risks. A prospective investor or other person reviewing Quartz for a prospective investor should not consider an investment in Quartz unless the investor is capable of sustaining an economic loss of the entire investment. No assurance that a prospective property of merit will be identified. The Company does not currently have an active exploration project, but is searching for a new acquisition. There is no assurance that a prospective property of merit will be identified, will be available if identified or that the Company will be able to enter into a property option or acquisition agreement. The mineral property underlying the Company's net smelter return royalty interest contains no known ore. The Company holds a 1% net smelter return ("NSR") royalty interest on the Quartz Mountain Property (recently renamed "Angel's Camp"), an exploration stage prospect in Oregon. The Company's interest in the property will be limited to any future NSR that would be forthcoming only if or when any mining commences on the property. There is currently no known body of ore on the property. Extensive additional exploration work will be required to ascertain if any mineralization may be economic. Exploration for minerals is a speculative venture necessarily involving substantial risk. There is no certainty that the expenditures to be made by the Company on any mineral properties will result in discoveries of commercial quantities of ore. As the Company does not have revenues, the Company will be dependent upon future financings to continue the Company's plan of operation. The Company has not generated any revenues since inception. The Company's plan of operations involves the identification of a prospective property of merit. There is no assurance that these activities will result in the establishment of commercially exploitable mineral deposits. Further, any acquisition will most likely be subject to the Company obtaining additional financing, of which there is no assurance. If a property is acquired, further financing will be required to fund exploration efforts, and, even if commercially exploitable mineral deposits are discovered, the Company will require substantial additional financing before the Company is able to achieve revenues from sales of any mineral resources that the Company is able to extract. The loss of management or other key personnel could harm the Company's business. The Company's success depends on its management and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. The Company's ability to execute its plan of operations, and hence its success, will depend in large part on the efforts of these individuals. The Company cannot be certain that it will be able to retain such personnel or attract a high caliber of personnel in the future. The Company has a history of losses and no foreseeable earnings. Quartz has a history of losses and expects to incur losses in the future, and there can be no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. The Company anticipates that it will retain any future earnings and other cash resources for the future operation and development of the Company's business. The Company has not paid dividends since incorporation and the Company does not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors after taking into account many factors including the Company's operating results, financial conditions and anticipated cash needs. 7 Going concern assumption. The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue on a going concern basis. However, unless additional funding is obtained, this assumption will have to change. The Company has incurred losses since inception. Failure to continue as a going concern would require that Quartz's assets and liabilities be restated on a liquidation basis, which could differ significantly from the going concern basis. General mining risks. The mining industry in general is intensely competitive. Even if the Company is successful in identifying and acquiring a prospective property of merit, and commercial quantities of ore are discovered, there is no assurance that a profitable market will ever exist for the sale of any minerals produced by the Company. Factors beyond the control of the Company may affect the marketability of any minerals that are discovered. Mineral prices have fluctuated widely in recent years. Other factors that may affect marketability include government regulations relating to price, royalties, and allowable production, and importing and exporting of minerals. The operations of the Company may require licenses and permits from various governmental authorities. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain all necessary licences and permits that may be required to carry out exploration, development and eventually operations at its projects. The mineral industry is intensely competitive in all its phases. The Company competes with many companies possessing far greater financial resources and technical facilities than itself for the acquisition of mineral concessions, claims, leases and other mineral interests as well as for the recruitment and retention of qualified employees. The industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively with other companies. The mineral exploration and mining business is competitive in all of its phases. The Company competes with numerous other companies and individuals, including competitors with greater financial, technical and other resources, in the search for and the acquisition of attractive mineral properties. The Company's ability to acquire properties in the future will depend not only on the Company's ability to develop its present properties, but also on the Company's ability to select and acquire suitable producing properties or prospects for mineral exploration. There is no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to compete successfully with its competitors in acquiring such properties or prospects. The Company's share price is volatile. The market price of a publicly traded stock, especially a junior resource issuer like the Company, is affected by many variables not directly related to the exploration success of the Company, including the market in which it is traded, the strength of the economy generally, the availability and attractiveness of alternative investments, and the breadth of the public market for the stock. On February 17, 2005, the Company transferred its listing from Tier 2 of the TSX Venture Exchange to NEX. NEX is a separate board of the TSX Venture Exchange, established in August 2003 to provide a new trading forum for listed companies that have fallen below the TSX Venture Exchange's ongoing listing standards due to low levels of business activity. The effect of these and other factors on the market price of the common shares on the NEX suggests that the Company's shares will continue to be volatile. The ability of the Company to reactivate itself as a Tier 2 Issuer on the TSX Venture Exchange is dependent on its ability to acquire a mineral project for active exploration. The Company's Directors and Officers are part-time and serve as directors and officers of other companies. All of the directors and officers of the Company serve as officers and/or directors of other resource exploration companies and are engaged in and will continue to be engaged in the search for additional resource opportunities on their own behalf and on behalf of other companies. Situations may arise where these directors and officers may be in direct competition with the Company. Such conflicts, if any, will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant provisions of British Columbia corporate and common law. In order to avoid the possible conflict of interest which may arise between the directors' duties to the Company and their duties to the other companies on whose boards they serve, the directors and officers of the Company expect that participation in exploration prospects offered to the directors will be allocated between the various companies that they serve on the basis of prudent business judgement and on the relative financial abilities and needs of the companies to participate. The success of the Company and its ability to continue to carry on operations is dependent upon its ability to retain the services of certain key employees and members of its Board of Directors. If the Company raises additional funding through equity financings, then the Company's current shareholders will suffer dilution. The Company currently has enough money to fund expected administrative costs and mineral property investigations for the next twelve months. However, additional working capital will be required to fund any significant mineral property acquisitions. Management anticipates that the Company will have to sell additional equity securities including, but not limited to, its common stock, share purchase warrants or some form of convertible security, in order to raise this additional working capital. The effect of additional issuances of equity securities will result in the dilution of existing shareholders' percentage ownership interests. 8 Likely PFIC status has consequences for United States investors. Potential investors who are U.S. taxpayers should be aware that the Company expects to be classified for U.S. tax purposes as a passive foreign investment company ("PFIC") for the current fiscal year, and may also have been a PFIC in prior years and may also be a PFIC in future years. If the Company is a PFIC for any year during a U.S. taxpayer's holding period, then such U.S. taxpayer generally will be required to treat any so-called "excess distribution" on its common shares, or any gain realized upon a disposition of common shares, as ordinary income which would be taxed at the shareholder's highest marginal rates and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such distribution or gain, unless the taxpayer has made a timely qualified electing fund ("QEF") election or a mark-to-market election with respect to the shares of the Company. In certain circumstances, the sum of the tax and the interest charge may exceed the amount of the excess distribution received, or the amount of proceeds of disposition realized, by the taxpayer. A U.S. taxpayer who makes a QEF election generally must report on a current basis its share of the Company's net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which the Company is a PFIC, whether or not the Company distributes any amounts to its shareholders. A U.S. taxpayer who makes the mark-to-market election generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of the common shares over the taxpayer's tax basis therein. See also Item 10E  "Passive Foreign Investment Company". Potential investors should also note that recently enacted legislation may require U.S. shareholders to report their interest in a PFIC on an annual basis. US shareholders of the Company should consult their tax advisors as to these reporting requirements as well as the consequences of investing in the Company Penny stock classification could affect the marketability of the Company's common stock and shareholders could find it difficult to sell their stock. The penny stock rules in the United States require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. Further, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from such rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These additional broker-dealer practice and disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the Company's common shares in the U.S., and shareholders may find it more difficult to sell their shares.
