Oplink provides customers with the flexible, worldwide shipment of assembled product. Our Strategy Oplink provides highly integrated optical sub-systems, design services and custom solutions to telecommunications equipment makers. By leveraging our well-established core competencies in optical design and packaging, we are able to serve not only telecommunications equipment makers, but also module and component makers in need of a manufacturing partner. The core elements of our strategy are: Continuous focus on our cost structure. Oplink maintains vertically integrated photonic manufacturing facilities in low-cost overseas locations. Our low cost manufacturing facilities allows us to do full design work in-house which enables us to supply cutting edge products at the lowest possible cost in the industry. In an industry characterized by intense price competition and at times price erosion, our low cost structure is a source of sustainable competitive advantage. The source of this sustainability comes from the fact that we believe our design and manufacturing facilities are difficult and expensive to replicate by other firms. Despite our existing streamlined cost structure, we continuously identify and implement cost-saving programs across our organization. The increase in the world-wide demand for broadband increases the demand for our products. With our vertically integrated cost structure, increasing world-wide demand leads to greater capacity utilization and therefore greater operating leverage as fixed costs are spread over a greater number of manufactured units, resulting in improved gross margins. 4 Table of Contents One-Stop-Shop. Oplink offers a one-stop-shop approach or turn-key solutions in its OMS service that provide customized solutions to our customers specific needs. One-stop-shopping is being increasingly demanded by our customers, the telecommunications network vendors. Our customers are increasingly requiring optical component suppliers to take advantage of developments in product integration to provide solutions incorporating multiple optical components on a single subsystem or module, thereby reducing the need for component assembly and additional testing. Therefore, we believe that suppliers like Oplink who are able to offer a more integrated manufacturing solutions to customers will have an advantage over suppliers who can only offer discrete optical components. The vertical integration of our design and manufacturing capability enables us to consistently deliver the highest quality, lowest cost products to our customers as well as to respond rapidly to design or specification changes which would shorten our customers time-to-market. We believe that offering broad solutions increases our penetration of existing customers. Selectively pursuing acquisitions. From time to time Oplink engages in strategic discussions with other companies. In an industry characterized with excess capacity and intense price competition, we believe there are merits in continued industry consolidation. We intend to play an active part in the consolidation of the industry and will consider using acquisitions as a vehicle to broaden our product portfolio, obtain critical technologies, strengthen our relationships with existing customers and to add new customers. Products and Technologies We provide a broad line of fiber optic subsystems and components designed to satisfy the needs of communications equipment suppliers. We categorize our products by the functionalities provided within a network, namely, bandwidth creation and bandwidth management. Some of our products have attributes that combine both of these functions. Some of our bandwidth creation and bandwidth management products utilize telecommunication interfaces to provide local or remote, reporting and control to enhance their function in an optical network. Excluding sales from OCPs product portfolio, sales of our bandwidth creation products accounted for 45%, 69% and 65% of our revenues in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Bandwidth Creation Products Communications equipment suppliers use our bandwidth creation products to expand the capacity and/or extend the coverage of their customers networks. Other bandwidth creation products enable optical signals to travel along more complex network architectures such as mesh networks and metro networks, or enable optical signals to travel greater distances over traditional long haul networks. Wavelength Expansion Products. In fiber optic communications, different signals are transmitted over multiple wavelengths. With increases in the number of wavelengths and data rates, spacing between the wavelengths narrows and it becomes increasingly difficult to separate and direct them. We offer wavelength expansion products that are designed to enable the combination and separation of a particular wavelength in all parts of the network including emerging access and metro networks and traditional long haul networks. Wavelength expansion products include wavelength multiplexing (combining), de-multiplexing (separating), and wavelength interleaving, which combines light signals from two or more simultaneous sources over a single fiber. We offer the following products to handle these tasks:  Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexers. A dense wavelength division multiplexer, or DWDM, is a solution for scalable, reliable, protocol independent bandwidth creation. A DWDM multiplexer is an integrated optical module or subsystem that combines two or more wavelengths for transmission over a single fiber (multiplexing) or separates these wavelengths (demultiplexing) at the receiving end. Our DWDM module and subsystem solutions are derived from an array of high performance technologies including thin film filters and arrayed wave guides, or AWGs. Our solutions are available in a variety of channel spacings.  Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexers. A coarse wavelength division multiplexer, or CWDM, is a solution for cost-effective bandwidth creation in the access, cable TV and metro environments. A CWDM 5 Table of Contents multiplexer is an integrated optical module or subsystem that combines two or more wavelengths, at a channel spacing that is many times wider than for standard DWDM channel spacing for multiplexing or demultiplexing.  Band Wavelength Division Multiplexers. Band wavelength division multiplexer, or BWDM, products help manage multiple International Telecommunication Union, or ITU, channels within multiplexer/demultiplexer (Mux/Demux) or optical add/drop applications. Our BWDMs pass a band of channels while isolating the channels adjacent to the band of channels sent. BWDM products facilitate the design of flexible (pay as you grow) low loss architectures as well as enable the design of complex mesh and ring networks. We offer a variety of BWDM products at 50, 100 and 200 GHz spacing.  DWDM Interleavers. A DWDM interleaver is an optical component that combines light signals from two simultaneous sources over a single fiber, which effectively doubles the capacity of the optical network system, or separates a single light source into multiple signals. Optical Amplification Products. Optical fiber amplifiers are widely deployed in optical communications networks to enhance the optical signal power. Optical signals typically lose power and eventually are lost after traveling a long distance along an optical fiber in traditional long haul networks. In emerging access or metro networks, optical signals lose power at add/drop nodes, which are those locations in a network where wavelength channels enter or exit the node. This power loss is referred to as attenuation. Through recent advances in technology, the optical signal can be amplified with Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers, or EDFAs, or with Raman amplifiers, neither of which require opto-electrical conversion. The amplifiers are arranged along fiber cable lines at regular intervals in long haul networks or at selected nodes in access and metro networks to enable the optical signal to reach its destination clearly. While amplifiers range in complexity, a typical amplifier consists of a fiber and a number of fiber optic components. We offer both EDFA and Raman amplification products including EDFA fiber amplifiers and the components used in EDFA and Raman amplifier designs. Our optical amplification products include the following:  Gain Blocks. Gain blocks are integrated optical subsystem building blocks consisting of fiber and fiber optic components used in fiber optic amplifiers to boost the amplitude of an incoming optical signal.  EDFAs. Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers are optical subsystems that employ gain blocks, advanced electronics, firmware and software to control the optical gain of an incoming optical signal.  WDM Pump/Signal Combiners. Micro-optic WDM pump/signal combiners are components that provide power for the optical amplifier. They are used to efficiently combine light signals with pump laser sources. Pump lasers are active optical components used in optical amplifiers such as EDFAs to amplify or regenerate light signals that naturally suffer loss while traveling over distance within an optical network.  Integrated Hybrid Components. Optical amplifier systems can combine optical components, including isolators, tap couplers and WDM pump/signal combiners. The main advantage of hybrid components is that they minimize the amplifier package size, increase reliability and reduce manufacturing cost.  WDM Pump Combiners. WDM pump combiners are used to increase the power of an optical amplifier by combining multiple pump lasers into one common pump source for amplification.  Polarization Beam Combiners. Polarization beam combiners are optical components that combine two of the same or different wavelengths with opposing polarization to increase the power output of the optical amplifier.  Gain Flattening Filters. Gain flattening filters are used to ensure signals are amplified by equal amounts. Our thin film filter technology, or the technology in which layers of thin film separate optical signals, employs multiple layers of optical materials on glass to adjust optical output at different wavelengths to meet the needs of next-generation high power amplifiers.  Isolators. Isolators are fiber optic devices that transmit light in only one direction, thus preventing a reflected light signal from returning to its laser source. Reflected light can interfere with a lasers process and create noise, which can impair system performance in optical networks. 6 Table of Contents  Tap Couplers. Tap couplers transfer optical signals between fibers. They are widely used for system monitoring purposes and have very low insertion loss, or the power loss incurred when adding additional components to a fiber cable. Bandwidth Management Products Communications equipment suppliers use our bandwidth management products to add intelligence to their systems, which allows communications service providers to monitor the performance, control the direction, and condition the amplitude of light signals throughout the optical network. Wavelength Performance Monitoring and Protection Products. The ability to monitor wavelengths within an optical network enables service providers to maintain quality of service even in the event of an interruption in the signal path, such as a cut in the fiber. It is significantly more difficult to monitor signal flow in optical systems as compared to electrical systems. Monitoring requires that optical signals be extracted from the fiber without interfering with the optical signal traveling through the same fiber. We offer the following products that enable service providers to monitor network performance and make necessary decisions for traffic flow and network efficiency:  Supervisory Channel WDM. Our supervisory channel WDM is an integrated component that separates the network supervisory channel from the signal channel that is used in monitoring the network performance.  Integrated WDM Monitor Arrays. Our integrated WDM monitor arrays convert optical signals into electrical signals for network selective wavelength power monitoring. This module combines multiple network performance monitoring functions in a single module and integrates WDM filters and third-party photo detectors, a device supplied by other optical component manufacturers that receives a light signal in an optical network and converts it into an electrical signal. These integrated modules allow communications service providers to monitor whether or not wavelengths are being transmitted properly through the network.  Integrated Tap Monitor Arrays. Our integrated tap monitor arrays convert optical signals into electrical signals for network signal power monitoring. This module integrates a tap coupler, a device that splits the light power, and third-party photo detectors, a device supplied by other optical component manufacturers that receives a light signal in an optical network and converts it into an electrical signal. These integrated modules allow communications service providers to monitor whether or not optical signals are being transmitted properly through the network.  Wavelength Protection Subsystems. Our multi-channel wavelength protection subsystems are integrated solutions that combine tap couplers, splitters, switches, electronics, firmware, software and third-party photo detectors. These subsystems integrate network switching protection functions and monitor optical signal quality such as optical power in response to unexpected disruption in the optical network. They provide redundant path protection with fast routing and switching with network fault management and diagnostic capability. Optical Switching and Routing Products. As optical networks become more complex, there is an increasing demand to provide switching and routing capability to direct optical signals across multiple points in the network. We supply optical fiber switching and routing products that provide all-optical signal switching between fibers with up to eight different end destinations. Our optical switching and routing products include the following:  Switches. Optical switches are devices that can direct optical signals to different end destinations.  Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers. Optical add/drop multiplexers, or OADMs, are used when part of the information from an optical signal carried on the network is demultiplexed, or dropped, at an intermediate point and different information is multiplexed, or added, for subsequent transmission. The remaining traffic passes through the multiplexer without additional processing. The OADM is typically used for rerouting a number of specific optical wavelengths with different end destinations. OADMs can also include other optical components such as optical conditioning products or optical monitoring products for increased functionality. 7 Table of Contents  Reconfigurable OADMs (ROADMs). ROADMs combine OADM functionality, optical wavelength selective switching, or WSS, and conditioning products, electronic circuitry, integrated firmware and software to add remote configuration and provisioning flexibility to the network by allowing the dynamic add/drop of variable optical wavelengths having different amplitudes with different end destinations.  Circulators. Circulators consist of sophisticated micro-optic components that are used to direct optical signals between different fibers. Circulators are also used in optical amplifying applications and used in DWDM fiber grating based wavelength expansion products. Wavelength Conditioning Products. For reliable fiber optic communication systems, the light signal intensity needs to be controlled. For example, excess input power can overload the receivers and an optical attenuator is used to reduce the input signal to the level required by the receiver. Wavelength conditioning products are used in optical networks along with DWDM multiplexers and demultiplexers, optical amplifiers, and re-configurable optical add drop multiplexers to provide the power control functions. Our wavelength conditioning products include the following:  Variable Optical Attenuators. Variable optical attenuators, or VOAs, are optical devices that reduce the power of the optical signal in DWDM networks to ensure that all optical signals within a network have equal power. The amount of power reduction of a particular optical signal can be adjusted to match the power of other optical signals in the network thereby enhancing network performance and service quality.  Variable Multiplexers. Variable Multiplexers combine multiple ITU channel signals along with the function of adjusting the power level. The subsystems attenuate the power level of individual ITU signal to achieve equalization of the spectrum or blocking specific channel.  Dynamic Band Equalization Products. Dynamic band equalization products monitor and adjust power levels of multiple bands of ITU channels. These subsystems separate multiple ITU channels into bands of channels, and then monitor and control the power levels of these bands through standard telecommunication interfaces such as RS232 and then multiplex these multiple bands onto a single fiber. They are used for power equalization in various parts of the network including metro and long haul. OCPs Product Portfolio The recent acquisition of OCP is expected to broaden Oplinks portfolio of offerings and significantly expand its addressable market. OCP offers a comprehensive line of high-performance fiber optic modules, including fiber optic transmitters, receivers, transceivers, and transponders, primarily for use in MAN, LAN, and FTTH applications. Fiber optic modules are pre-assembled components that are used to build network equipment. OCPs products convert electronic signals into optical signals and back into electronic signals, thereby facilitating the transmission of information over fiber optic communication networks. OCPs fiber optic products integrate advanced optical devices with mixed analog/digital integrated circuits. These circuits allow continuously varying signals and digital data to be designed in the same circuit rather than separate circuits. OCPs products provide subsystem/module functionality over a wide variety of connectivity speeds, distances, standards and operating temperature ranges. OCPs products are engineered with varying levels of integration to suit OCPs customers. The lowest level of integration involves separate transmitter and receiver modules, which provides our customers the greatest flexibility in product design by allowing them to place the transmitters and the receivers according to their design specifications. Transceivers provide the next level of integration. Transceivers place both the transmitter and receiver in the same package with a dual fiber or connector interface. Transmitters and Receivers  Transmitters convert an electronic digital input signal into an optical output signal for transmission over a fiber optic network. Receivers detect optical signals from a fiber optic network and convert them into an electronic signal in standard digital/logic format for further signal processing. OCP offers separate transmitter and receiver modules that provide our customers with the greatest flexibility in product design by allowing them to place transmitters and receivers separately according to design specifications. 8 Table of Contents OCPs optical transmitter and receiver products support the SONET/SDH, Fast Ethernet, and Gigabit Ethernet transmission standards and are offered in a wide range of data rates, transmission distances and packaging options. Transceivers  Optical transceivers are products that contain both a transmitter and a receiver in a single package and serve as high data rate interconnects between network devices, such as routers, switches, servers and access elements. OCPs optical transceivers are available in a wide variety of fiber optic interfaces, or form factors, and support a wide range of data rates, wavelengths, modes and transmission distances. OCPs transceivers support the SONET/SDH, ATM, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet Passive Optical Network (GePON), Gigbabit Passive Optical Network (GPON), ESCON and Fiber Channel transmission standards. SFP Transceivers  Small form-factor pluggable, or SFP, transceivers are hot-pluggable optical transceivers that can be removed or inserted into the equipment without turning off the power of the system. This feature allows OCPs customers to readily reconfigure their systems without interrupting their network services, thereby, eliminating system downtime during upgrades and maintenance. OCPs cam latches are color coded to provide the end-user with an easy way to identify module types in an installed system. OCPs SFP transceiver is available in a variety of distances and speeds and uses the popular small form factor LC fiber optic connector interface, allowing fiber optic equipment makers to increase their port density. They are also offered in speeds from 155 Mb/s up to 2.5Gb/s including multimode LED and 850nm VCSEL light sources as well as single mode 1310nm and 1550nm lasers. OCP provides commercial and industrial temperature ranges for many of OCPs SFP transceiver models. CWDM Transceivers  Coarse wavelength division multiplexing, or CWDM, transceivers, allow the mixing of optical signals by utilizing different wavelengths. The CWDM transceivers use lasers with wide channel wavelength spacing, typically 20 nm, which allows the equipment to achieve a lower overall system cost. This lower cost is the result of a lower transmitter cost since no temperature and wavelength control is needed, as well as a lower optical MUX/DMUX cost due to wider tolerance on the wavelength stability and bandwidth. OCPs CWDM transceivers are available in all the common industry standard transceiver footprints of 1x9, 2x9, GBIC, SFF and SFP, and provide eight wavelength channels at nominally 1471 nm, 1491 nm, 1511 nm, 1531 nm, 1551 nm, 1571 nm, 1591 nm, and 1611 nm. They are available in a multi-rate format that allows operation at all speeds from 100 Mb/s Fast Ethernet up to 2.5Gb/s SONET/SDH. OCPs Gigabit Ethernet CWDM product family is available in an industrial operating temperature option (−40 to +85 degrees Celsius). Bi-Directional Transceivers  Bi-Directional transceivers allow full duplex transmission utilizing a single fiber. These transceivers incorporate lasers, receivers and optical filters, allowing simultaneous transmission and reception from a single port or a single fiber. The advantage of Bi-Directional transceiver modules is lower material cost, lower installation cost and lower operational cost for fiber installations, as a result of having to purchase, install, maintain, and administer fewer fibers. OCPs Bi-Directional transceivers are available in industry standard pluggable modules (SFP) and are compliant to the industry standard known as EFM (Ethernet for First Mile). The data transmission rates are 1250Mb/s and 125Mb/s, which are the Gigabit Ethernet and Fast Ethernet standard rates, respectively. Our Gigabit Ethernet and Fast Ethernet Bi-Directional product families are available in an industrial operating temperature option (−40 to +85 degree Celsius). DWDM Transceivers  Dense wavelength division multiplexing, or DWDM, transceivers, allow the mixing of optical signals by utilizing different wavelengths. The DWDM transceivers use lasers with narrow channel wavelength spacing, typically 0.8 nm or 100GHz. DWDM transceivers enable an optical transport system to increase the transmission capacity over a single fiber. OCPs DWDM transceivers are available in the SFP package, and provide 44 wavelength channels. They are available in a multi-rate format that allows operation at all speeds from 125Mb/s up to 2.67Gb/s and accommodate reaches up to 200km. GePON products  OCPs GePON product offering supports ONU (optical network unit) and OLT (optical line terminal) applications. The GePON modules transmit a duplex 1.25Gb/s optical signal over a single fiber 9 Table of Contents between the OLT and ONU modules. The OLT module transmits via a 1490 nm FP laser source and the ONU unit transmits via a 1310 nm FP laser source. Customers We sell our products worldwide to telecommunications, data communications and cable TV equipment manufacturers around the globe. In certain cases, we sell our products to our competitors or other component manufacturers for their resale or integration into their own products. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we sold our products to over 381 companies worldwide, including sales from OCP products. Our top five customers, including sales from OCP products, although not the same five customers for each period, together accounted for 64%, 52% and 63% of our revenues in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Tellabs Operations, Inc. (Tellabs) and Hua Wei Technologies Co. Ltd. (Huawei) accounted for greater than 10% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Flextronics Canada, Inc. (Flextronics) and Huawei each accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. For fiscal 2006, primarily all of our shipments to Flextronics, a contract manufacturer, were to fulfill purchase orders placed by Nortel Networks Corporation (Nortel). Through Flextronics and through direct sales, Nortel accounted for greater than 10% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Nortel, Flextronics and Huawei each also accounted for greater than 10% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. We expect that the majority of our revenues will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers, although potentially not the same customers period to period. In addition, some of our customers are companies with which we presently compete or in the future may compete. See Concentration of Credit Risk under Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As the acquisition of OCP was consummated towards the end of fiscal 2007, the revenue derived from OCP products has not been significant for fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2008, we expect that a small number of end customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue as there is a large degree of customer overlap between Oplink and OCP. Backlog We are substantially dependent upon orders we receive and fill on a short-term basis. We do not have contracts with our customers that provide any assurance of future sales, and sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders, often with extremely short lead times, and which are frequently subject to revision or cancellation. Because of the possibility of changes in delivery or acceptance schedules, cancellations of orders, returns or price reductions, we do not believe that backlog is a reliable indicator of our future revenues. Marketing, Sales and Customer Support We market and sell our products through both direct sales and distribution channels, including seven international sales representatives and distributors. Our sales representatives and distributors are independent organizations within North America, Europe and Asia. As of June 30, 2007, Oplink employed 29 people in sales, marketing and customer service and support in the U.S. and 22 people in sales and marketing in Asia, who manage key customer accounts and support our direct sales force, sales representatives and distributors. OCP employed 19, 7 and 4 people in those functions in the US, Asia and UK, respectively. Our marketing team promotes our products within the communications industry as well as gathers and analyzes market research. Our intent is to become a market driven supplier that provides cost-effective, value-add solutions to our customer base. Our marketing professionals help us to identify and define next-generation products by working closely with our customers and our research and development engineers. They also coordinate our participation in trade shows and design and implement our advertising effort. Our web site provides customers with a comprehensive listing of our broad product portfolio. We provide extensive technical support to our customers during their design and qualification process as well as ongoing post-sales support. OCP primarily sells its products through a worldwide direct sales force supported by independent manufacturers representatives and distributors. OCP maintains regional sales offices in Northern and Southern California, Texas, New Hampshire, Canada, the United Kingdom, Taiwan and Japan. In addition, OCP has direct sales 10 Table of Contents personnel located on the East Coast of the United States, working from home offices. OCPs customer service department is based in Woodland Hills, California and provides day-to-day updates on orders and deliveries to customers. OCP also has a satellite customer service operation in the United Kingdom. Product Development As of June 30, 2007, Oplink had 217 engineers involved in research and development of its products. Oplinks engineering team has extensive design, packaging, processing, electrical, mechanical, firmware and software experience in the fields of fiber optic components, integrated optic interfaces and systems. Our primary component and subsystem development center is located in Zhuhai, China and our access market system development center is located in Shanghai, China. Our research and development expense, including non-cash compensation expense, was $7.4 million, $6.7 million and $7.2 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We spend a significant portion of our financial resources on our research and development budget and staff to enhance our current fiber optic subsystems and components and to develop new technologies and products to serve the current and next-generation communication markets. We believe that some of our competitors are developing products similar to those that we have under development. While we are currently developing products in all of the areas described above, we may choose to prioritize or redirect our development efforts in response to market demands. Therefore, it is not certain that we will introduce products for any or all of the categories listed above. Manufacturing We currently manufacture substantially all of our subsystems and components at our manufacturing facilities in China. We maintain a pilot line at our headquarters in Fremont, California. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, we completed the transfer of manufacturing processes and assembly operations to our facility in the Zhuhai Free Trade Zone, China from the United States. Our facility in the Zhuhai Free Trade Zone maintains complete in-house manufacturing capabilities including component and module design, integration, production and testing. We plan to continue to invest resources in manufacturing management, engineering and quality control. We also plan to continue to develop automated manufacturing systems to provide higher throughput, improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs. We own our facility in the Zhuhai Free Trade Zone totaling approximately 667,000 square feet. Our facility in the Zhuhai Free Trade Zone is used for administration, manufacturing, research and development and employee living quarters. We currently lease 58,000 square feet of our facility in the Zhuhai Free Trade Zone to third parties and will attempt to lease to third parties the remaining areas that are in excess of our current requirements. We lease two facilities located in Shanghai, China, which are used for administration, manufacturing and research and development. Our Shanghai facilities total approximately 65,000 square feet. The leases for these two facilities expire in July 2008. A number of critical raw materials used in manufacturing our products are acquired from single or limited source suppliers. The inability to obtain sufficient quantities of those materials may result in delays, increased costs and reductions in our product shipments. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the storage, use, discharge and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous or regulated chemicals or materials used in our manufacturing processes. To date, such laws and regulations have not materially affected our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for the foreseeable future. OCP, our majority-owned subsidiary, is in the process of transitioning its manufacturing operations to a third party contract manufacturer. Historically OCP assembled, burned in and tested all of its products in its facilities in Woodland Hills, California and in Hsinchu, Taiwan. OCP conducted all of its manufacturing engineering, quality assurance and documentation control at these facilities. In November 2006, OCP announced an agreement with SAE Magnetics (H.K.) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TDK Corporation to manufacture certain of their 11 Table of Contents product lines in China commencing in July 2007. OCP intends to sell part of its existing manufacturing facilities in Woodland Hills, California and will reduce its workforces once manufacturing at SAE begins. Quality We have established a quality management system to assure that the products we provide to our customers meet or exceed industry standards. Oplinks products undergo rigid qualification tests and studies and are conducted according to Telcordia standards. Oplinks ongoing reliability testing builds upon industry standards to establish continuous reliability improvements through intensive tests and performance measures. These systems are based on the international standard ISO 9001. Our U.S. headquarters have been modeled after the ISO 9001-1994 quality standard in research and manufacturing since July 1998. Our manufacturing operations at Zhuhai and Shanghai, China are both third-party certified to the ISO 9001-2000 standard. In addition, our Zhuhai facility has recently been third-party recertified to TL 9000 Telecommunications quality standard and ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 environmental management standard. Competition The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. Our overall competitive position depends upon a number of factors, including:  competitive pricing;  the quality of our manufacturing processes and products;  the breadth of our product line;  availability, performance and reliability of our products;  our ability to participate in the growth of emerging technologies;  the ability to win designs through prototyping;  established relationships with key customers;  ability to provide technical design support;  the compatibility of our products with existing communications networks;  manufacturing capacity and capability; and  our financial strength. We believe that our principal competitors are the major manufacturers of optical subsystems and components, including both vendors selling to third parties and business divisions within communications equipment suppliers. Our primary competitors include Avago Technologies, Avanex Corporation, DiCon Fiberoptics, ExceLight Communications and its parent corporation, Sumitomo Electric, FDK Corporation, Finisar, Furukawa, MRV Communications, NEL Hitachi Cable, OpNext, Optium, Santec Corporation, JDS Uniphase Corporation and numerous optical component manufacturers in China. We believe that we primarily compete with diversified suppliers, such as JDS Uniphase, Santec Corporation and FDK Corporation, for the majority of our product line and to a lesser extent with niche players that offer a more limited product line. We also believe that JDS Uniphase has the greatest market share for fiber optic components and subsystems. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, engineering and manufacturing resources as well as greater name recognition and stronger customer relationships. Competitors in any portion of our business also may rapidly become competitors in other portions of our business. In addition, our industry has recently experienced significant consolidation, and we anticipate that further consolidation will occur. This consolidation has increased, and will likely continue to increase competition. 12 Table of Contents Intellectual Property As of June 30, 2007, and excluding patents from OCPs product portfolio, we have been granted 104 issued patents and have 4 patent applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for various technologies and products, including DWDM interleavers, DWDM subsystems, multi-channel optic filter arrays, high reliability fused couplers, circulators, compact optical switches and polarization beam combiners. The terms of our patents are computed in accordance with United States federal patent statutes. In general, this means that a patent will have a term expiring twenty years from its filing date. In addition, we currently have 17 issued patents and 20 pending patent applications in the Peoples Republic of China, 31 of which are counterparts to U.S. patents or patent applications. While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law and restrictions on disclosure to protect our technology, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. We cannot assure you that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology. Protecting our intellectual property is critical to the success of our business. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, various unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries, including China, do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the optical communications industry. We expect that fiber optic subsystems and components may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. In addition, we believe that many of our competitors in the optical communications industry have filed or intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology on which they may claim our technology infringes. We cannot make any assurances that other third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to our technology. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. A successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could seriously harm our financial condition. On June 7, 2007 the Company initiated legal action against several parties by filing a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Before any defendant named in the complaint filed an answer, the Company, on August 24, 2007, filed in the same court a First Amended Complaint for Patent Infringement, Trade Secret Misappropriation, Breach of the Duty of Loyalty, Unfair Competition, Breach of Contract and Intentional Interference With Contractual Relations against O-Net Communications (ShenZhen), Ltd., Multiwave Digital Solutions, Inc., and Chunmeng Wu. The amended complaint requests an order enjoining O-Net Communications (ShenZhen), Ltd. and Multiwave Digital Solutions, Inc. from making, using or selling devices covered by the Companys patents, an order enjoining Multiwave Digital Solutions, Inc. and Wu from Misappropriating the Companys trade secrets, monetary damages, attorneys fees and costs. On August 1, 2007 O-Net Communications (ShenZhen), Ltd. and Multiwave Digital Solutions, Inc. filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California a complaint for Declaratory Judgment Of Non-Infringement and Invalidity of Patents against the Company. The complaint seeks a judgment against the Company declaring that O-Net Communications (ShenZhen), Ltd. and Multiwave Digital Solutions, Inc. have not infringed on the Companys patents, a judgment declaring that four patents held by the Company are invalid, and an award of attorneys fees and costs. Pursuant to a stipulation between the litigants, the U.S. District Court on August 29, 2007 ordered that the Companys Amended Complaint be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. O-Net Communications (ShenZhen), Ltd. and Multiwave Digital Solutions, Inc. agreed to dismiss their complaint 13 Table of Contents for Declaratory Judgment filed in Northern District but reserved the right to include the same declaratory relief causes of action as counterclaims in the legal proceeding initiated by the Company. On April 12, 2002, OCP entered into a five-year license agreement with Stratos Lightwave, Inc. covering Stratos portfolio of optoelectronic transceiver patents. In addition, OCP acquired two licenses related to VCSEL technology resulting from OCPs acquisition of certain assets of Cielo Communications. With the exception of these three licenses, OCP currently does not license to or from any other third parties the technology used in the manufacture of its fiber optic modules. In addition, no technology is transferred or licensed in connection with its supply relationship with Furukawa. Accordingly, Furukawa owns the technology relating to the manufacture of its laser and other products OCP purchases from Furukawa for incorporation into OCPs products and may license or sell this technology to other parties. Employees As of June 30, 2007, Oplink had 78 full-time employees located in the United States, and 1,961 full-time employees located in Asia . None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. All of our employees in Zhuhai are represented by a labor union formed on November 6, 2001, pursuant to the requirements of the Chinas Labor Union Law. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. As of June 30, 2007, OCP had 334 full-time employees located in the United States and 302 full-time employees located in Asia and Europe. OCPs employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements and OCP has never experienced a work stoppage.

Item 1A  Risk Factors We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves many risks, some of which are beyond our control. The following is a discussion that highlights some of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, operations or financial results. We have incurred significant losses in the past, and if we are unable to continue to increase our revenues while controlling our costs and operating expenses, we may be unable to sustain our profitability. Although we were profitable in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 with net income of $13.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, we did incur significant losses of $2.6 million, $6.4 million and $36.8 million in fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We will need to continue to increase our revenues while controlling costs and operating expenses to sustain profitability. Our revenues may not grow sufficiently in future quarters to sustain profitability. The acquisition of approximately 58% of the outstanding shares of common stock in Optical Communication Products (OCP) on June 5, 2007 may adversely impact our profitability and lead to future net losses. As of June 30, 2007, we had an accumulated deficit of $212.0 million. We depend upon a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues, and any decrease in revenues from, or loss of, these customers without a corresponding increase in revenues from other customers would harm our operating results. We depend upon a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues. Our dependence on orders from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each customer critical to our business. Our top five customers, although not the same five customers for each period, together accounted for 64%, 52%, and 63% of our revenues for the years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition one customer accounted for 33% of our revenue for the year ended June 30, 2007. We expect that the majority of our revenues will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers, although potentially not the same customers period to period. Our revenues generated from these customers, individually or in the aggregate, may not reach or exceed historic levels in any future period. We may not be the sole source of supply to our customers, and they may choose to purchase products from other vendors. Furthermore, the businesses of some of our existing customers are currently experiencing slow growth following a protracted downturn, which is resulting, in some instances, in significantly decreased sales to these customers and harming our results of operations. The loss of one or more of our significant customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or future price reductions could cause our revenue to decline significantly. Our dependence on a small number of customers may increase if the fiber optic components and subsystems industry and our other target markets continue to consolidate. We do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. Instead, sales to our customers are made on the basis of individual purchase orders that our customers may cancel or defer on short notice without significant penalty. In the past, some of our major customers canceled, delayed or significantly accelerated orders in response to changes in the manufacturing schedules for their systems, and they are likely to do so in the future. The reduction, cancellation or delay of individual customer purchase orders would cause our revenue to decline. Moreover, these 17 Table of Contents uncertainties complicate our ability to accurately plan our manufacturing schedule. Additionally, if any of our customers cancel or defer orders, our operating expenses may increase as a percentage of revenue. In the past, our customers have sought price reductions from us, and they are likely to continue to do so in the future. In addition, some of our customers may shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors. Our ROADM Optical Switching and Routing product is a new product that has accounted for a significant proportion of our recent revenue growth. A decline in the price of, or demand for, our ROADM product, our failure to achieve broader market acceptance, or the introduction of competing products by competitors, could harm our revenues and operating results. Further, even if revenue from our ROADM product remains strong, our overall gross margins will continue to be negatively affected by sales of our ROADM product. Our ROADM product accounted for 33% and 3% of our revenues for the years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, and for 69% and 8% of the revenue growth for such periods, respectively. Any decline in the price of, or demand for, our ROADM product, or our failure to achieve broader market acceptance, or the introduction of competing products by competitors, could harm our revenues and operating results. There is intense competition in the industry to supply ROADM products to our customers. Currently, our ROADM product is sold to one customer, who in turn sells the product primarily to one end-user customer. Because our ROADM customer is the sole-source supplier of such product for the end-user customer, there is a risk that the end-user customer will seek alternative sources of supply, and reduce orders from our customer, which would reduce our revenues. Further, because the primary components of our ROADM product are available from third party vendors, our competitors may be able to introduce competing ROADM products without significant expenditures of resources and without long delays to market. There is also a risk that the vendor that provides the primary and critical component to our ROADM product may be acquired by another company in our industry, and that as a result, we would lose all of our current ROADM business. Even if revenues from our ROADM product are not diminished by price declines, lack of broad market acceptance, reductions in demand or the introduction of competing ROADM products or an acquisition of the vendor that provides the primary and critical component to our ROADM product by another company, and sales of our ROADM product continue to be strong, our overall gross margins will continue to be negatively affected by sales of our ROADM product. Gross profit margins for this product are significantly below the average margins of our other products. In the year ended June 30, 2007, the ROADM product revenues increased significantly faster than the revenues for our other products. The result of the lower margins for the ROADM product and faster revenue growth has been a decline in our gross profit margins. Should the ROADM product revenues grow faster than the revenues of our other products, our gross profit margins will decline further. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses or technologies, our operating results may be harmed. The recent acquisition of a 58% stake in OCP is our largest ever acquisition and may substantially challenge Oplinks management infrastructure The communications industry is evolving rapidly and is highly competitive. Accordingly, we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of businesses and technologies, or the establishment of joint venture arrangements, that could expand our business. The negotiation of potential acquisitions or joint ventures, as well as the integration of an acquired or jointly developed business or technology, could cause diversion of managements time and other resources or disrupt our operations. Future acquisitions could result in:  additional operating expenses without additional revenues;  potential dilutive issuances of equity securities;  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities;  amortization of other intangibles;  research and development write-offs; and  other acquisition-related expenses. 18 Table of Contents On June 5, 2007, Oplink consummated its acquisition from The Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd. (Furukawa) of Furukawas 58% ownership interest in OCP. On June 19, 2007, Oplink and OCP entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which Oplink would acquire the remaining 42% of OCPs outstanding common stock, subject to the approval of holders of two-thirds of the outstanding OCP shares not currently held by Oplink. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in acquiring the remaining outstanding shares of OCP. If we are not successful in acquiring all of the remaining shares of OCP, then our ability to realize the expected benefits of the transaction may be limited, because, among other reasons, we would not be able to fully integrate the businesses of Oplink and OCP or realize any anticipated synergies. Further, even if we are successful in acquiring all of the shares of OCP, the acquisition may prove unfavorable to us and our stockholders, because we may not realize expected benefits or synergies, we may not be able to successfully integrate OCPs business with our own, the price paid for OCP and the expenses incurred in the transaction may be higher than the actual value of the acquired business, or consolidating OCPs operating results with our own may impair our consolidated operating results, due to OCPs lower gross margins, higher operating expenses, and lack of profitability. Our acquisition of businesses or technologies will require significant commitment of resources. We may be required to pay for any acquisition with cash, but we cannot be certain that additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. We have little experience in acquiring other businesses and technologies. Potential acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including:  problems assimilating the purchased operations, technologies or products;  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;  diversion of managements attention from our core business;  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and  potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or joint ventures with our operations. Specifically, the unsuccessful integration of the OCP, F3, Inc. and Fibercom Optics Communication, Inc. acquisitions may impact the value of our technology and subsequently the carrying value of our purchased intangible assets and goodwill. As a result, we may incur an impairment charge of up to the full book value of Oplinks goodwill and intangible assets. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we recorded an impairment charge of $322,000 based on the amounts by which the carrying value of purchased intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of Gigabit Optics Corporation and Accumux Technologies, Inc. exceeded their fair value. This charge negatively affected our operating results for fiscal 2005, and any of the factors listed above could harm our operating results in future periods. Our wavelength expansion products have accounted for a significant proportion of our revenues, and our revenues could be harmed if the price of, or demand for these products further declines or if these products fail to achieve broader market acceptance. We believe that our future growth and a significant portion of our future revenues will depend on the commercial success of our wavelength expansion products. Customers that have purchased wavelength expansion products may not continue to purchase these products from us. Although we currently offer a broad spectrum of products, sales of our wavelength expansion products accounted for a significant proportion of our revenues in the years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005. These products include, among others, wavelength division multiplexers. These products accounted for 31%, 51% and 44% of our revenues in the years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During fiscal 2007, we have experienced a slight downward trend in revenues on wavelength division multiplexers. Any decline in the price of, or demand for, our wavelength expansion products, or their failure to achieve broader market acceptance, could harm our revenues. 19 Table of Contents The optical networking component industry is experiencing declining average selling prices, which could cause our gross margins to decline and harm our operating results. The optical networking component industry is experiencing declining average selling prices (ASPs) as a result of increasing competition, price pressures from significant customers, greater manufacturing efficiencies achieved through increased automation in the manufacturing process and declining market demand. We anticipate that such ASPs will continue to decrease in the future in response to product and new technology introductions by competitors. Therefore, we must continue to develop and introduce new products that can be sold at higher prices on a timely basis to maintain our overall average selling prices. Failure to do so could cause our revenue and gross margins to decline. These declining ASPs have contributed and may continue to contribute to a decline in our gross margins, which could harm our results of operations. Because none of our customers are obligated to purchase our products, they may cancel or defer their purchases at any time and on short notice, which could harm our operating results. We are substantially dependent on orders we receive and fill on a short-term basis. We do not have contracts with our customers that provide any assurance of future sales, and sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders, often with extremely short lead times. Accordingly, our customers:  may stop purchasing our products or defer their purchases at any time without penalty;  are free to purchase products from our competitors;  are not required to make minimum purchases; and  may cancel orders that they place with us. As a result, we cannot rely on orders in backlog as a reliable and consistent source of future revenue. Sales to any single customer may and do vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Our customers generally do not place purchase orders far in advance. In addition, our customers purchase orders have varied significantly from quarter to quarter. This means that customers who account for a significant portion of our revenues in one quarter may not and often do not place orders at the same level as the current quarter in the succeeding quarter, which makes it difficult to forecast our revenues in future periods. Moreover, our expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future revenue, and we may be unable to adjust costs in a timely manner in response to further revenue shortfalls. This can result in significant quarterly fluctuations in our operating results. Our markets are highly competitive, some of our customers are also our competitors, and our other customers may choose to purchase our competitors products rather than our products or develop internal capabilities to produce their own fiber optic modules. The market for fiber optic modules is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Our primary competitors include Avago Technologies, Avanex Corporation, DiCon Fiberoptics, ExceLight Communications and its parent corporation, Sumitomo Electric, FDK Corporation, Finisar, Furukawa, MRV Communications, NEL Hitachi Cable, OpNext, Optium, Santec Corporation, JDS Uniphase Corporation and numerous optical component manufacturers in China. We also face indirect competition from public and private companies providing non-fiber optic networking products that address the same networking needs that our products address. The development of alternative solutions to fiber optic transmission needs by our competitors, particularly systems companies that also manufacture modules, such as JDS Uniphase, could significantly limit our growth and harm our competitive position. Many of our current competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do. As a result, these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. In addition, those of our competitors that have large market capitalization or cash reserves are in a much better position to acquire other companies in order to gain new technologies or products that may displace our products. Any of these potential acquisitions could give our competitors a strategic advantage. In addition, many of our competitors have much 20 Table of Contents greater brand name recognition, more extensive customer bases, more developed distribution channels and broader product offerings than we do. These companies can use their broader customer bases and product offerings and adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share. In addition, existing and potential customers, especially in Japan and other international markets, may also become competitors. These customers have the internal capabilities to integrate their operations by producing their own optical modules or by acquiring our competitors or the rights to produce competitive products or technologies, which may allow them to reduce their purchases or cease purchasing from us. We expect our competitors to introduce new and improved products with lower prices, and we will need to do the same to remain competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully against either current or future competitors with respect to new products. We believe that competitive pressures may result in price reductions, reduced margins, additional write down of inventory and our loss of market share. If we are unable to generate adequate additional revenue as a result of the expansion of our sales operations, our competitive position may be harmed and our revenue or margins may decline. Historically, we have relied primarily on a limited direct sales force, supported by third party manufacturers representatives and distributors, to sell our products. Our sales strategy focuses primarily on developing and expanding our direct sales force, manufacturers representatives and distributors. We have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs related to the expansion of our sales operations. If the expansion of our sales operations does not generate adequate additional revenue, our operating margins may decline. To the extent we are unsuccessful in developing our direct sales force, we will likely be unable to compete successfully against the significantly larger and well-funded sales and marketing operations of many of our current or potential competitors. In addition, if we fail to develop relationships with significant manufacturers representatives or distributors, or if these representatives or distributors are not successful in their sales or marketing efforts, sales of our products may decrease and our competitive position would be harmed. Our representatives or distributors may not market our products effectively or may not continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales, marketing and technical support. Our inability to effectively manage our domestic and foreign sales and support staff or maintain existing or establish new relationships with manufacturer representatives and distributors would harm our revenue and result in declining margins. If our customers do not approve our manufacturing processes and qualify our products, we will lose significant customer sales and opportunities. Customers generally will not purchase any of our products before they qualify them and approve our manufacturing processes and quality control system. Our customers may require us to register under international quality standards, such as ISO 9001. We are currently registered under ISO 9001:2000. Delays in product qualification or loss of ISO 9001 certification may cause a product to be dropped from a long-term supply program and result in a significant lost revenue opportunity. If particular customers do not approve of our manufacturing processes, we will lose the sales opportunities with those customers. Our customers typically expend significant efforts in evaluating and qualifying our products and manufacturing process prior to placing an order. This evaluation and qualification process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle, typically ranging from nine to twelve months and sometimes longer. During this time, customers may perform or require us to perform extensive evaluation and qualification testing of our products. Generally, they consider a wide range of issues before purchasing our products, including interoperation with other components, product performance and reliability. During the period that our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur substantial sales, marketing and research and development expenses, expend significant management efforts, and increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead-time supplies. Even after this evaluation process, it is possible that a potential customer will not purchase our products. In addition, our customers product purchases are frequently subject to unplanned processing and other delays, particularly with respect to larger customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their overall purchase activity. If sales forecasts to specific customers are not realized, our revenue and results of 21 Table of Contents operations may be negatively impacted. Long sales cycles may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter, which could cause volatility in our stock price. Our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and, therefore, may vary from public market analysts or investors expectations, which could cause our stock price to drop. It is difficult to forecast our revenues accurately. Moreover, our revenues, gross margins, expenses and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. The factors, many of which are more fully discussed in the other risk factors below, that are likely to cause these variations include, among others:  the availability of raw materials used in our products, increases in the price of these raw materials or to the extent a greater degree of the raw material content of our product is from third parties, which most likely would cause our gross profit margin to decline;  impact on our sales and margins as a result of our customers continued migration to contract manufacturers and the extent to which we engage in contract manufacturing activities, which most likely would cause our gross profit margin to decline;  fluctuation in the mix of products sold towards products with lower margins such as ROADMs;  fluctuations in demand for, and sales of, our products;  changes in customer, geographic or product mix and the average selling prices of our products;  economic conditions specific to the communications and related industries and the development and size of the markets for our products;  our inability to cut costs quickly in the event of market or demand downturns, due to the fact that a high percentage of our expenses, including those related to manufacturing, engineering, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative functions, is fixed in the short term;  cancellations or delays of orders or shipment rescheduling by our customers;  the lingering effects of the recent economic downturn and resulting uncertainty of the fiber optic industry;  the ability of our manufacturing operations in China to timely produce and deliver products in the quantity and of the quality our customers require;  our ability to successfully improve our manufacturing capabilities and achieve acceptable production yields in our facilities in China;  the tendency of communications equipment suppliers to sporadically place large orders with short lead times;  competitive factors in the fiber optic components and subsystems market, including introductions of new products, new technologies and product enhancements by competitors, consolidation of competitors, customers and service provider end users and pricing pressures;  our ability to develop, introduce, manufacture and ship new and enhanced optical networking products in a timely manner and in production quantities without defects or other quality issues;  with respect to new products, a mismatching of research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses that are incurred in one quarter with revenues that are not recognized, if at all, until a subsequent quarter when the new products are introduced and commercially accepted; and  costs associated with, and the outcomes of, any intellectual property or other litigation to which we are, or may become, a party. 22 Table of Contents If we fail to effectively manage our manufacturing capability, produce products that meet our customers quality requirements and achieve acceptable production yields in China, we may not be able to deliver sufficient quantities of products that meet all of our customers order requirements in a timely manner, which would harm our operating results. We manufacture substantially all of our products in our facilities in Zhuhai and Shanghai, China. The quality of our products and our ability to ship products on a timely basis may suffer if we cannot effectively maintain the necessary expertise and resources to effectively manage our manufacturing activities in China. The acquisition of approximately 58% of OCP will add to the complexity in effectively managing our manufacturing capability and meeting customers order requirements in a timely manner. We have in the past received unexpectedly large numbers of product returns due to manufacturing defects in our products. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we experienced greater than anticipated manufacturing defects in our subsystem products and, as a result, increased our warranty reserves. We have identified and believe we have remedied these problems. However, if we cannot prevent these problems from reoccurring, we may lose customers and revenue, and our operating results will be severely harmed. Because manufacturing our products involves complex and precise processes and the majority of our manufacturing costs are relatively fixed, manufacturing yields are critical to our results of operations. Factors that affect our manufacturing yields include the quality of raw materials used to make our products, the quality of workmanship and our manufacturing processes. Our or our suppliers inadvertent use of defective materials could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields. Furthermore, because of the large labor component in, and complexity of, our manufacturing processes, quality of workmanship is critical to achieving acceptable yields. We cannot assure you that we will be able to hire and train a sufficient number of qualified personnel to produce our products cost-effectively with the quality and in the quantities required by our customers. Changes in our manufacturing processes or those of our suppliers could also impact our yields. In some cases, existing manufacturing techniques, which involve substantial manual labor, may not allow us to meet our manufacturing yield goals cost-effectively so that we maintain acceptable gross margins while meeting the cost targets of our customers. We will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques that will involve higher levels of automation in order to increase our gross margins and help achieve the targeted cost levels of our customers. We may not achieve manufacturing cost levels that will allow us to achieve acceptable gross margins or fully satisfy customer demands. Additionally, our competitors are automating their manufacturing processes. If we are unable to achieve higher levels of automation and our competitors are successful, it will harm our gross margins. Additional risks associated with managing our manufacturing processes and capability in China include:  our ability to procure the necessary raw materials and equipment on a timely basis;  a potential lack of availability of qualified management and manufacturing personnel;  our ability to maintain quality;  our ability to effectively manage headcount, particularly if we undertake to expand our manufacturing operations;  vulnerability of telecommunications networks in East Asia to natural disasters, such as the recent earthquake that damaged several undersea fiber-optic cables responsible for Internet and telephone connections with parts of China; and  our ability to quickly and efficiently implement an adequate set of financial controls to effectively track and control inventory levels and inventory mix and to accurately predict inventory requirements. Communications equipment suppliers typically require that their vendors commit in advance to provide specified quantities of products over a given period of time. We may not be able to pursue many large orders from these suppliers if we do not have sufficient manufacturing capabilities to enable us to commit to provide them with their specified quantities of products. If we are unable to commit to deliver sufficient quantities of our products to satisfy a customers anticipated needs, we likely will lose the order and the opportunity for significant sales to that 23 Table of Contents customer for a lengthy period of time. Furthermore, if we fail to fulfill orders to which we have committed, we will lose revenue opportunities and our customer relationships may be harmed. If we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately, we could incur additional carrying costs and have excess and obsolete inventory or we could experience manufacturing delays, which could cause us to lose orders or customers. We currently use historical data, a backlog of orders and estimates of future requirements to determine our demand for components and materials. We must accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead-time required to obtain the necessary components and materials. Lead times for components and materials vary significantly depending on factors such as the specific supplier, the size of the order, contract terms and demand for each component at a given time. As a result, we generally maintain high levels of inventories that periodically cause us to have excess and obsolete inventory. However, if we were to underestimate our purchasing requirements, manufacturing could be interrupted, resulting in delays in shipments, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. If we do not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields in a cost-effective manner, or if we are required to develop new manufacturing processes to improve our yields, our operating results would be impaired. The manufacture of our products involves complex and precise processes. As a result, it may be difficult to cost-effectively meet our production goals. In addition, changes in our manufacturing processes or those of our suppliers, or our suppliers inadvertent use of defective materials, could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields, increase our costs and reduce our product shipments. To increase our gross margin, while offering products at prices acceptable to customers, we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques that will involve higher levels of automation and costs to meet these goals that could impair our operating results. OCPs transition of manufacturing operations from California and Taiwan to SAE in China is subject to risks and uncertainties. OCP has entered into an agreement with SAE to manufacture certain product lines in China, which began in July 2007. This agreement will allow OCP to move into high-volume production in China to augment its capabilities in short-run, specialized applications. If OCPs customers do not qualify the manufacturing lines of SAE for volume shipments, its operating results and customer relationships may suffer. OCP may experience delays, disruption or quality problems in the manufacturing operations of SAE, especially during the initial startup of manufacturing with them. As a result, OCP may incur additional costs that would adversely affect its gross margins, and product shipments to its customers could be delayed beyond requested shipment schedules, which could adversely affect its revenues, competitive position and reputation. In addition, in connection with the transition, a reduction in OCPs workforce is expected in both the U.S. and Taiwan with anticipated transitional costs for contract manufacturing. These transitional charges are primarily estimated severance and retention payments. These workforce reductions were initiated during the three months ended June 30, 2007 and are expected to continue through fiscal 2008. Should OCP lose a significant portion of the workforce to attrition prior to the move, its operations may be significantly impacted beyond the anticipated transitional charges estimated. There is a risk that, during this period of manufacturing transition, management will not sufficiently coordinate the role of its workforce to ensure that all areas of their operations receive appropriate attention. If OCP is unable to manage its workforce, manufacturing capacity and scope of operations effectively, the cost and quality of its products may suffer. Our products may have defects that are not detected until full deployment of a customers equipment, which could result in a loss of customers, damage to our reputation and substantial costs. Our products are deployed in large and complex optical networks and must be compatible with other system components. Our products can only be fully tested for reliability when deployed in these networks for long periods of time. Our customers may discover errors, defects or incompatibilities in our products after they have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. Our products may also have errors, defects or incompatibilities 24 Table of Contents that are not found until after a system upgrade is installed. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we experienced greater than anticipated defects in our subsystem products and, as a result, increased our warranty reserves. Errors, defects, incompatibilities or other problems with our products could result in:  loss of customers;  loss of or delay in revenues;  loss of market share;  damage to our brand and reputation;  inability to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;  diversion of development resources;  increased service and warranty costs;  legal actions by our customers; and  increased insurance costs. If any of these occur, our operating results could be harmed. We depend on the growth and success of the communications industry, which is subject to severe fluctuations in economic activity and is also experiencing consolidation and realignment, as well as a trend towards outsourced manufacturing. We depend on the continued growth and success of the communications industry, which depends, in part, on the continuing growth of the Internet, wireless, optical and cable services as a widely-used medium for commerce and communication and the continuing demand for increased bandwidth over communications networks. As a result of the effects of the severe downturn in the optical and communications industry following the year 2000, our ability to acquire new customers or to obtain additional orders from existing customers has been impeded. While several service providers, including AT&T and Verizon, have announced current and planned investment which we believe could increase traffic demand, it is too early to predict the outcome of these potential FTTH roll-outs. Because visibility in the industry remains limited, we cannot provide any assurance as to the timing or extent of any increased business that we may receive as a result of these or other industry developments. Furthermore, the rate at which communications service providers and other fiber optic network users have built new fiber optic networks or installed new systems in their existing fiber optic networks has fluctuated in the past and these fluctuations may continue in the future. These fluctuations may result in reduced demand from historical rates for new or upgraded fiber optic systems that utilize our products and, therefore, may result in reduced demand for our products. The communications industry is also experiencing rapid consolidation and realignment, as industry participants seek to capitalize on the rapidly changing competitive landscape developing around the Internet and new communications technologies such as fiber optic and wireless communications networks. As the communications industry consolidates and realigns to accommodate technological and other developments, our customers and service provider end users may consolidate or align with other entities in a manner that may delay orders and harms our business. Our customers continued outsourcing might result in their utilizing large well-established contract manufacturers to provide final system assembly, rather than utilizing us for final system assembly. We may therefore be required to provide lower level components to these contractor manufacturers rather than final system assembly to our current customers, potentially resulting in reduced revenues and lower gross margins and profits. Furthermore, these contract manufacturers may seek other source of components, which could harm our operating results. Additionally, to remain competitive we may need to provide a contract manufacturing service, which could harm our gross margins. With the acquisition of OCP, many of our fiber optic modules are used primarily in metropolitan area network (MAN), local area network (LAN) and fiber to the home (FTTH) applications. These markets are rapidly 25 Table of Contents evolving, and it is difficult to predict their potential size or future growth rate. In addition, we are uncertain as to the extent to which fiber optic technologies will be used in these markets. Our success in generating revenue will depend on the growth of these markets and their adoption of fiber optic technologies. As demand for bandwidth grows, service providers are likely to require increasingly sophisticated systems able to support and meet the requirements of MAN, LAN and FTTH applications and networks, such as cost-effectiveness and reliability in harsh environmental conditions. The projected demand for such networking equipment has led to the expansion of production by existing optical component manufacturers, as well as the creation of new companies in Asia offering cost-effective fiber optic components. This increased competition and resulting lower component cost structure has accelerated price and margin erosion in this market, resulting in reduced revenues and write-down of certain inventory to net realizable value. Competition within the telecommunication industry for this growing FTTH segment is likely to intensify and certain of our competitors may be able to more quickly and effectively respond to newer technology or industry standards, devote more resources to development, production, promotion and sale of their products and deliver those products at lower prices. Based on these and other factors, customers may reduce orders for our products and, as a result, our revenue in future periods may decline. In addition, our ability to meet financial expectations for future periods may be harmed. Because we depend on third parties to supply some of our raw materials and equipment, we may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials and equipment, or these materials may become unavailable due to technological changes, which could limit our ability to fill customer orders and harm our operating results. Difficulties in obtaining raw materials in the future may delay or limit our product shipments, which could result in lost orders, increase our costs, reduce our control over quality and delivery schedules and require us to redesign our products. We depend on third parties to supply the raw materials and equipment we use to manufacture our products. To be competitive, we must obtain from our suppliers, on a timely basis, sufficient quantities of raw materials at acceptable prices. We obtain most of our critical raw materials from a single or limited number of suppliers and generally do not have long-term supply contracts with them. As a result, our suppliers could terminate the supply of a particular material at any time without penalty. Due to the effects of the severe downturn in the optical and communications industries, manufacturers and vendors that we rely upon for raw materials may scale back their operations or cease to do business entirely as a result of financial hardship or other reasons. In addition, our suppliers could terminate the supply of a particular material due to technological changes, which would require us to redesign our products, identify and qualify acceptable replacement suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that we could obtain qualifications for such replacements from our customers. Furthermore, some of our suppliers are competitors who may chose not to supply raw materials to us in the future, or who may sell their capability to parties that may be adverse to our goals. In addition, some of the equipment we use is relatively complex and, in periods of high market demand, the lead times from order to delivery of this equipment could be as long as six months. To the extent a greater degree of the raw material content of our product is from third parties, which may be necessary to provide our customers with the latest technology, our financial results may be negatively impacted. Our ROADM product accounted for 33% and 3% of our revenues in the years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The primary and majority of the components in the ROADM product are obtained from third party vendors. A delay, reduction or termination of the supply of any of these components from any of the third party vendors could materially impact our revenues and operating results. OCP purchases the majority of its lasers from Furukawa under a Master Purchase Agreement. OCP does not have long-term supply contracts with any other key suppliers and the agreement with Furukawa is only for one year. OCPs dependence on a small number of suppliers and its lack of longer term supply contracts exposes it to several risks, including its potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of quality components, the discontinuance of key components from our suppliers, price increases and late deliveries. In the last three years, OCP has negotiated price reductions for the lasers it purchases from Furukawa. However, the laser price reductions that OCP has been able to obtain from Furukawa have been less than the price 26 Table of Contents reductions for the associated products that it has given its customers resulting in lower and lower gross margins. The erosion in gross margins may continue with respect to products that incorporate parts purchased from Furukawa. While OCP will continue to negotiate with Furukawa with respect to the pricing of the lasers it purchases from them, OCP cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful in addressing this negative impact on its gross margins. On June 5, 2007, Furukawa sold all of its majority interest in OCPs outstanding capital stock to Oplink. We are unable to predict the impact of the consummation of Oplinks purchase of Furukawas interest in OCP on OCPs supply relationship with Furukawa. We cannot assure you that Furukawa will renew the Master Purchase Agreement upon its expiration on September 30, 2007 or that it will continue to provide services and components to OCP, and if not, whether or on what terms we could find adequate alternative sources for these services and components. We compete in a highly competitive industry, and if we are unable to compete successfully or develop new products and product enhancements that achieve market acceptance, our revenues could decline, which would harm our operating results. The market for fiber optic components and subsystems is intensely competitive. We believe that our principal competitors are the major manufacturers of optical components and subsystems, including vendors selling to third parties and business divisions within communications equipment suppliers. Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, purchasing, manufacturing and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and to changes in customer requirements, to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, or to deliver competitive products at lower prices. Competitors in any portion of our business may also rapidly become competitors in other portions of our business. In addition, our industry has recently experienced significant consolidation, and we anticipate that further consolidation will occur. This consolidation has further increased competition. The ability for optical companies to go public and raise capital has also improved. These new public companies could potentially create additional competition in the markets we participate in. Several companies are capable of producing ROADM products, which accounted for 33% and 3% of our revenues in the years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Should these companies successfully compete with us at our customer or sell ROADM products directly to our customers customer then our revenue and operating results could be materially impacted. There is significant interest and competition in the ROADM product market. Several of our existing and potential customers are also current and potential competitors of ours. These companies may develop or acquire additional competitive products or technologies in the future and thereby reduce or cease their purchases from us. In light of the consolidation in the optical networking industry, we also believe that the size of the optical component and subsystem suppliers will become increasingly important to our current and potential customers in the future. Our current and potential suppliers may also consolidate with our competitors and thereby reduce or cease providing materials and equipment to us. Also, we expect to pursue optical contract manufacturing opportunities in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors, and the competitive pressures we face may result in lower prices for our products, loss of market share, the unavailability of materials and equipment used in our products, or reduced gross margins, any of which could harm our business. The communications industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. As a result, the introduction of new products incorporating new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing products obsolete. For example, new technologies are being developed in the design of wavelength division multiplexers that compete with the thin film filters that we incorporate in our products. These technologies include arrayed waveguide grating and planar lightwave circuits. Additionally, a new technology is being developed in the design of equalization and switching, known as microelectro-mechanical systems, which will compete with the bulk micro-optics that we incorporate into our product. Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate market needs and to develop products that address those needs. Our failure to predict market needs accurately or to develop or obtain through acquisition new products or product enhancements in a timely manner will harm market acceptance and sales of our products. In this regard, we are currently developing bandwidth creation products as well as bandwidth management products. If the 27 Table of Contents development of these products or any other future products takes longer than we anticipate, or if we are unable to develop and introduce these products to market, our revenues could suffer and we may not gain market share. Even if we are able to develop and commercially introduce these new products, the new products may not achieve widespread market acceptance. Furthermore, we have implemented, and may continue to implement in the future, significant cost-cutting measures such as reductions in our workforce, including reductions in research and development and manufacturing personnel, that may weaken our research and development efforts or cause us to have difficulty responding to sudden increases in customer orders. In addition, we recently expanded our operations to include optical manufacturing services. We cannot, however, assure you that we will be able to successfully manage our manufacturing capabilities to produce quality products in a cost-effective manner or gain market acceptance with respect to any optical manufacturing service offerings. In addition, because profit margins with respect to optical contract manufacturing services may be smaller than the margins applicable to our current and past product offerings, our gross margins may decline and our financial results may be harmed as a result of our provision of such services. Also, to the extent a greater degree of the raw material content of our product is from third parties, which may be necessary to provide our customers with the latest technology, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we do not respond to the changes in a timely manner, our products likely will not achieve market acceptance. The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change, new and improved product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. Our future success will depend to a substantial extent on our ability to develop, introduce and support cost-effective new products and technology on a timely basis. The development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. Because the costs for research and development of new products and technology are expensed as incurred, such costs will have a negative impact on our reported net operating results until such time, if ever, that we generate revenue from products or technology resulting from such research and development. If we fail to develop and deploy new cost-effective products and technologies or enhancements of existing products on a timely basis, or if we experience delays in the development, introduction or enhancement of our products and technologies, our products may no longer be competitive, our revenue will decline and we may have inventory that may become obsolete or in excess of future customer demand. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors, technological changes or emerging industry standards. Our failure to respond to product announcements, technological changes or industry changes in standards would likely prevent our products from gaining market acceptance and harm our competitive position. Rapid technological change in the industry may have an adverse impact on the value of our acquired intangible assets and goodwill from the OCP, F3, Inc. and Fibercom Optics Communication, Inc. acquisitions. This may impact the carrying value of our purchased intangible assets and goodwill. If our liability for U.S. and foreign taxes is greater than we have anticipated and reserved for, our operating results may suffer. We are subject to tax in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. We believe that we have adequately estimated and reserved for our tax liability. However, our business operations, including our transfer pricing for transactions among our various business entities operating in different tax jurisdictions, may be audited at any time by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities. Any such audits may result in tax liabilities in excess of those we have estimated. In November 2005, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service commenced an audit of our U.S. federal tax returns for our 2003 fiscal year. The audit for the tax year 2003 has been completed and no additional tax liabilities were assessed. In addition, we have estimated our U.S. tax liability assuming the benefit of substantial net operating loss carryforwards. The use of our net operating loss carryforwards prior to 1999 are subject to certain limitations due to 28 Table of Contents certain changes in our ownership in 1999 and 1998. If the use of our net operating loss carryforwards is limited to a further extent than we anticipate, our operating results may suffer. Disruption to commercial activities in the United States or in other countries, particularly in China and Taiwan, may adversely impact our results of operations, our ability to raise capital or our future growth. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside the United States and substantial portions of our operations are located in China and Taiwan. Our international operations expose us to a number of additional risks associated with international operations, including, without limitation:  disruptions to commercial activities or damage to our facilities as a result of natural disasters, political unrest, war, terrorism, labor strikes, and work stoppages;  disruptions of telecommunications networks due to natural disasters, such as the recent earthquake that damaged several undersea fiber-optic cables responsible for Internet and telephone connections with parts of China;  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations with personnel who have expertise in optical network technology;  unexpected changes in regulatory or certification requirements for optical systems or networks;  disruptions in the transportation of our products and other risks related to the infrastructure of foreign countries;  economic instability;  any future outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza and other epidemics or illnesses; and  power shortages at our manufacturing facilities in China, which may lead to production delays. To the extent that such disruptions interfere with our commercial activities, our results of operations could be harmed. After the outsourcing of OCPs manufacturing capability to China, substantially all of Oplinks and OCPs manufacturing operations will be located in China and are subject to the laws and regulations of China. Our operations in China may be adversely affected by changes in the laws and regulations of China, such as those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. Chinas central or local governments may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations, which would require additional expenditures. Chinese leaders noted concerns regarding Chinas recent economic growth since April 2004 and indicated, without providing specific details, that they may take very forceful measures to bring the economy under control. On April 27, 2006, the Peoples Bank of China announced that it would raise the minimum rate banks charge on one-year loans in local currency 0.27 percentage points to 5.85 percent effective April 28, 2006. Furthermore, on August 18, 2006, the Peoples Bank of China, Chinas central bank, announced that it would raise both lending and deposit interest rates 0.27 percentage points effective August 19, 2006. Chinas economy differs from the economies of many countries in terms of structure, government involvement, specificity and enforcement of governmental regulations, level of development, growth rate, capital reinvestment, allocation of resources, self-sufficiency and rate of inflation, among others. Our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed by changes in the political, economic or social conditions in China. In addition, events in Taiwan and especially China over which we have no control, such as political unrest, terrorism, war, labor strikes and work stoppages, could disrupt our operations. There is currently political tension between the United States and North Korea and the United States and China, which could, in either case, result in hostilities or deterioration in relations that would impact our trade relations with China. There is also significant tension between China and Taiwan, which could result in hostilities or lead to a breakdown in trade relations between China and the United States. Additionally, China continues its condemnation of the United States pledge of military support to Taiwan, which could lead to hostilities. Moreover, anti-Japanese sentiment in China may lead 29 Table of Contents to business disruptions. If hostilities or other events cause a disruption in our operations, it would be difficult for us to establish manufacturing operations at an alternative location on comparable terms. We are exposed to currency rate fluctuations and exchange controls that could adversely impact our operating results. Significant portions of our operations are conducted in currencies other than the United States dollar, particularly in Chinese Renminbi and with the recent acquisition of a majority ownership in OCP, portions of our operations will now be conducted in the new Taiwan dollar. Our operating results are therefore subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, in July 2005, China uncoupled Renminbi from the dollar and will let it float in a narrow band against a basket of foreign currencies. The move revalued Renminbi by 2.1% against the U.S. dollar. It is possible that the Chinese government could adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in more significant fluctuation of Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. The Renminbi-U.S. dollar exchange rate could float, and the Renminbi could appreciate relative to the U.S. dollar. While the international reaction to the Renminbi revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the government of China to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. Any significant revaluation of the Renminbi may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, operating results and financial position. To reduce our gains and losses associated with converting foreign currencies into United States dollars, we may elect in the future to enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure. However, we cannot be certain that any such hedging activities will be effective, or available to us at commercially reasonable rates. As a result, we will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses. Moreover, Chinas government imposes controls on the convertibility of Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Any shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of our Chinese subsidiaries to obtain and remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends to us or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations, such as payments to us for components, which we export to them and for technology licensing fees. Such shortages may also cause us to experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit needed foreign currency. Under the current foreign exchange control system, sufficient foreign currency is presently available for our Chinese subsidiaries to purchase imported components or to repatriate profits to us, but as demands on Chinas foreign currency reserves increase over time to meet its commitments, sufficient foreign currency may not be available to satisfy Chinas currency needs. Our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to convert and remit our sales received in Renminbi into U.S. dollars. Under existing foreign exchange laws, Renminbi held by our Chinese subsidiaries can be converted into foreign currencies and remitted out of China to pay current account items such as payments to suppliers for imports, labor services, payment of interest on foreign exchange loans and distributions of dividends so long as our subsidiaries have adequate amounts of Renminbi to purchase the foreign currency. Expenses of a capital nature such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies, however, require approval from appropriate governmental authorities before Renminbi can be used to purchase foreign currency for remittance out of China. This system could be changed at any time by executive decision of the State Council to impose limits on current account convertibility of the Renminbi or other similar restrictions. Moreover, even though the Renminbi is intended to be freely convertible on current accounts, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which is responsible for administering Chinas foreign currency market, has a significant degree of administrative discretion in interpreting and implementing foreign exchange control regulations. From time to time, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange has used this discretion in ways that effectively limit the convertibility of current account payments and restrict remittances out of China. Furthermore, in many circumstances the State Administration of Foreign Exchange must approve foreign currency conversions and remittances. Under the current foreign exchange control system, sufficient foreign currency may not always be available in the future at a given exchange rate to satisfy our currency demands. 30 Table of Contents If tax benefits available to our subsidiaries located in China are reduced or repealed or our China subsidiaries fail to meet the requirements for utilizing such tax benefits, our financial condition and operating results could suffer. Our subsidiaries located in China enjoy tax benefits in the form of tax holidays in China that are generally available to foreign investment enterprises, including full exemption from national enterprise income tax for two years starting from the first year when accumulated earnings have turned positive and a 50% reduction in the national income tax rate for the following three years. In addition, local enterprise income tax is often waived or reduced during this tax holiday/incentive period. Furthermore, under current regulations in China, foreign investment enterprises that have been accredited as technologically advanced enterprises are entitled to an additional three-year reduction in national income tax by 50%, with a provision that the income tax rate as so reduced may not be lower than 10%. The Chinese government recently announced that preferential tax treatment for foreign enterprises has been repealed. Under the new tax law, unused tax holidays for existing foreign-invested enterprises will be grandfathered until they expire. However, if we do not generate taxable income by January 1, 2008, under the new tax law, the tax holiday is deemed to begin on January 1, 2008 and we may lose a portion or all of the benefits of the tax holiday. In addition, in order to qualify for such benefits, a foreign investment enterprise must be operated continuously for ten years. In the past our subsidiaries in China have qualified for preferential tax treatment and have not been obligated to pay income tax. However, if our subsidiaries fail to meet the operation requirement due to events outside of their control, they may be required to pay for income tax on past profits. If China further elects to repeal or reduce the tax benefits available to us in the future or we fail to continue to qualify for the tax benefits, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to protect our proprietary technology, our ability to succeed will be harmed. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we have taken may not prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries, such as China, where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Many U.S. companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in some foreign countries. If we are unable to protect our proprietary technology, our ability to succeed will be harmed. We may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights. These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of the attention of our technical and management personnel. We may be involved in intellectual property disputes in the future, which will divert managements attention and could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology. Participants in the communications and fiber optic components and subsystems markets in which we sell our products have experienced frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Numerous patents in these industries are held by others, including our competitors and academic institutions. In addition, from time to time, we have become aware of the possibility or have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merit, responding to such claims could be time consuming, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. We have no means of knowing that a patent application has been filed in the United States until the patent is issued. Optical component suppliers may seek to gain a competitive advantage or other third parties may seek an economic return on their intellectual property portfolios by making infringement claims against us. From time to time we may be involved in lawsuits as a result of alleged infringement of others intellectual property. For example, in December 2001, Oz Optics Limited, OZ Optics, Inc. and Bitmath, Inc. (collectively, OZ) filed a lawsuit against us and four individuals, including our former Vice President of Product Line Management, alleging trade secret misappropriation and other related claims. Under the complaint, the plaintiffs sought damages against the four individuals in the amounts of approximately $17,550,000, and against us in the amount of approximately $1,500,000, as well as enhanced damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorney fees, and 31 Table of Contents other relief. We settled the lawsuit against us in August 2004 and OZ agreed to dismiss the case against us with prejudice. On June 7, 2007, Oplink initiated legal action against several parties by filing a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Before any defendant named in the complaint filed an answer, Oplink on August 24, 2007, filed in the same court a First Amended Complaint for Patent Infringement, Trade Secret Misappropriation, Breach of the Duty of Loyalty, Unfair Competition, Breach of Contract and Intentional Interference With Contractual Relations against O-Net Communications (ShenZhen), Ltd., Multiwave Digital Solutions, Inc., and Chunmeng Wu. The amended complaint requests an order enjoining O-Net Communications (ShenZhen), Ltd. and Multiwave Digital Solutions, Inc. from making, using or selling devices covered by Oplinks patents, an order enjoining Multiwave Digital Solutions, Inc. and Chunmeng Wu from misappropriating Oplinks trade secrets, monetary damages, attorneys fees and costs. On August 1, 2007 O-Net Communications (ShenZhen), Ltd. and Multiwave Digital Solutions, Inc. filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California a complaint for Declaratory Judgment Of Non-Infringement and Invalidity of Patents against Oplink. The complaint seeks a judgment against Oplink declaring that O-Net Communications (ShenZhen), Ltd. and Multiwave Digital Solutions, Inc. have not infringed on Oplinks patents, a judgment declaring that four patents held by Oplink are invalid, and an award of attorneys fees and costs. Pursuant to a stipulation between the litigants, the U.S. District Court on August 29, 2007 ordered that Oplinks Amended Complaint be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. O-Net Communications (ShenZhen), Ltd. and Multiwave Digital Solutions, Inc. agreed to dismiss their complaint for Declaratory Judgment filed in the Northern District but reserved the right to re-file the complaint as a cross-action in the legal proceeding initiated by Oplink. Both prosecuting and defending lawsuits involving our intellectual property may be costly and time consuming and may also divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Intellectual property litigation is often highly complex and can extend for a protracted period of time, which can substantially increase the cost of litigation. Accordingly, the expenses and diversion of resources associated with intellectual property litigation to which we may become a party could seriously harm our business and financial condition. In the process of asserting our intellectual property rights, these rights could be found to be invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Failure to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could result in our inability to prevent our competitors from utilizing our proprietary rights. Any intellectual property litigation also could invalidate our proprietary rights and force us to do one or more of the following:  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;  stop selling, incorporating or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property;  pay substantial money damages; or  redesign the products that use the technology. Any of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period of time. We may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights. These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel. We are the target of a securities class action complaint and are at risk of securities class action litigation, which could result in costs and divert management attention and resources. In November 2001, Oplink and certain of its officers and directors were named as defendants in a class action shareholder complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, now captioned In re Oplink Communications, Inc. Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, Case No. 01-CV-9904. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege that Oplink, certain of Oplinks officers and directors and the underwriters of Oplinks initial public offering (IPO) violated Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 based on allegations that 32 Table of Contents Oplinks registration statement and prospectus failed to disclose material facts regarding the compensation to be received by, and the stock allocation practices of, the IPO underwriters. The complaint also contains a claim for violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegations that this omission constituted a deceit on investors. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. Similar complaints were filed by plaintiffs (the Plaintiffs) against hundreds of other public companies (the Issuers) that went public in the late 1990s and early 2000s (collectively, the IPO Lawsuits). On August 8, 2001, the IPO Lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial purposes before United States Judge Shira Scheindlin of the Southern District of New York. On July 15, 2002, Oplink joined in a global motion filed by all of the Issuers (among others) to dismiss the IPO Lawsuits. On October 9, 2002, the court entered an order dismissing Oplinks named officers and directors from the IPO Lawsuits without prejudice, pursuant to an agreement tolling the statute of limitations with respect to these officers and directors until September 30, 2003. On February 19, 2003, the court issued a decision denying the motion to dismiss the Section 11 claims against Oplink and almost all of the Issuers, and granting the motion to dismiss the Section 10(b) claim against Oplink without leave to amend. In June 2003, the Issuers and Plaintiffs reached a tentative settlement agreement and entered into a memorandum of understanding, providing for, among other things, a dismissal with prejudice and full release of the Issuers and their officers and directors from all liability resulting from Plaintiffs claims, and the assignment to Plaintiffs of certain potential claims that the Issuers may have against the underwriters. In addition, the tentative settlement guarantees that, in the event that the Plaintiffs recover less than $1 billion in settlement or judgment against the underwriter defendants in the IPO Lawsuits, the Plaintiffs would be entitled to payment by each participating Issuers insurer of a pro rata share of any shortfall in the Plaintiffs guaranteed recovery. In such event, Oplinks obligation would be limited to the amount remaining under the deductible of $1.0 million of Oplinks insurance policy. In September 2003, in connection with the tentative settlement, Oplinks officers and directors who had entered tolling agreements with the Plaintiffs (described above) agreed to extend those agreements so that they would not expire prior to any settlement being finalized. In June 2005, Oplink executed a formal settlement agreement with the Plaintiffs. On February 15, 2006, the Court issued a decision certifying a class action for settlement purposes and granting preliminary approval of the settlement subject to modification of certain bar orders contemplated by the settlement. On April 24, 2006, the Court held a hearing to consider whether the settlement should finally be approved, and took the matter of final approval under submission. In addition, the settlement is still subject to statutory notice requirements as well as final judicial approval. Pending final approval of the settlement, Oplink continues to believe that the action against Oplink is without merit and intends to defend against it vigorously. However, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, Oplink cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation. Any unfavorable outcome of the litigation could have an adverse impact on Oplinks business, financial condition and results of operations. In December 2006, the Second Circuit Court of Appeal determined the cases could not be certified as class actions and should be dismissed. As a result of this decision, the plaintiffs are now attempting to take a number of steps to avoid dismissal of all IPO cases. Specifically, the plaintiffs have filed amended complaints to the Master Allegations. Plaintiffs amendments were focused on narrowing the class definition to comply with the Second Circuits Miles decision. There has been no court ruling yet on the amended complaints. We depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire additional personnel, our ability to sell our products could be harmed. Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering, finance, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support personnel. In addition, we depend substantially upon the continued services of key management personnel at our Chinese subsidiaries. None of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term, and these personnel may terminate their employment at any time. In addition, we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees. Our loss of any key employee, the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or the inability of our officers and key employees to expand, train and manage our employee base may prevent us from executing our growth strategy. 33 Table of Contents Our ability to continue to attract and retain highly-skilled personnel will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future. Competition for highly-skilled personnel is intense. We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. In addition, our management team has experienced significant personnel changes over the past and may continue to experience changes in the future. In June 2007, our then Chief Financial Officer resigned after several years of being with Oplink. If our management team experiences further changes and does not work effectively together, it could substantially harm our business. The June 5, 2007 acquisition of a majority stake in OCP may cause disruptions to our operations which may increase employee turnover especially at OCP. Although Oplink has retention agreements with key OCP employees to facilitate a smooth and timely integration, key OCP employees may nevertheless experience uncertainty about their future role with OCP which may increase employee turnover. We may have difficulty attracting replacement employees especially in key management, sales, marketing and technical support personnel, which could further affect our operating results. Because some of our third-party sales representatives and distributors carry products of one or more of our competitors, they may not recommend our products over competitors products. Our sales representatives and distributors are independent organizations that generally have exclusive geographic territories and generally are compensated on a commission basis. We are currently migrating some of our larger customers to direct sales. We expect that we will continue to rely on our independent sales representatives and distributors to market, sell and support many of our products for a substantial portion of our revenues. Some of our third-party sales representatives and distributors carry products of one or more of our competitors. As a result, these sales representatives and distributors may not recommend our products over competitors products, which could decrease our sales and harm our business. Our failure to comply with governmental regulations could subject us to liability. Our failure to comply with a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States, China and Taiwan could subject us to criminal, civil and administrative penalties. Our products are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations that regulate the export of products and disclosure of technical information to foreign countries and citizens. In some instances, these laws and regulations may require licenses for the export of products to, and disclosure of technology in, some countries, including China and Taiwan, and disclosure of technology to foreign citizens. With the exception of two commodity classifications we obtained from the Department of Commerce in 2001 with respect to some of our current products, we have generally relied on self-classification in determining whether an export license is required and have determined that export licenses are not required. As we develop and commercialize new products and technologies, the list of products and technologies subject to U.S. export controls changes, or in the event that the relevant export authorities disagree with the outcome of our self-classification, we may be required to obtain export licenses or other approvals with respect to those products and technologies and may possibly be subject to penalties under applicable laws. We cannot predict whether these licenses and approvals will be required and, if so, whether they will be granted. The failure to obtain any required license or approval could harm our business. We ship inventory and other materials to and from our facilities in China and Taiwan and, as a result, are subject to various Chinese, Taiwanese and U.S. customs-related laws. Given the geographic distance and changing regulations and governmental standards, it can be difficult to monitor and enforce compliance with customs laws. For example, there have been inventory and other materials shipped to and from our facilities in China for which, upon arrival of the goods, there was not sufficient documentation to demonstrate the items comply with all local customs regulations. The U.S. Customs Service may also require us to revise product classifications from time to time with respect to various items imported into the United States. In such cases we may be required to pay any increase in customs duty to account for the difference in duty actually paid by Oplink and the duty owed under the amended product classification, and may also be subject to penalties under applicable laws. In addition, from time to time we enter into transfer pricing arrangements with our subsidiaries to establish sales prices for internal distributions of goods that have the effect of allocating taxes between the parent corporation 34 Table of Contents and our subsidiaries. In general, these transfer prices have not been approved by any governmental entity and, therefore, may be challenged by the applicable tax authorities. China tax authorities have recently announced that they plan to increase transfer-pricing audits, and have specifically identified telecommunications companies, among others, as priority targets. We employ a number of foreign nationals in our U.S. operations and, as a result, we are subject to various laws related to the status of those employees with the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. We also send our U.S. employees to China from time to time and for varying durations of time to assist with our Chinese operations. With the recent acquisition of a majority stake in OCP, it is very likely that we will also be sending our employees to Taiwan. Depending on the durations of such arrangements, we may be required to withhold and pay personal income taxes in respect of the affected U.S. employees directly to the Chinese and Taiwanese tax authorities, and the affected U.S. employees may be required to register with various Chinese and Taiwanese governmental authorities. Our failure to comply with the foregoing laws and regulations or any other applicable laws and regulations could subject us to liability. In addition, we are subject to laws relating to the storage, use, discharge and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous or regulated chemicals or materials used in our manufacturing processes. While we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, if we fail to store, use, discharge or dispose of hazardous materials appropriately, we could be subject to substantial liability or could be required to suspend or adversely modify our manufacturing operations. In addition, we could be required to pay for the cleanup of our properties if they are found to be contaminated, even if we are not responsible for the contamination. Enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations have increased and are likely to continue to increase our costs. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required and will continue to require changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires the SEC to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects, in addition to rule proposals already made, and we may need to make further changes in response to such new rules. In addition, NASDAQ has revised its requirements for companies that are NASDAQ-listed, such as us. We expect these developments (i) have required and may continue to require us to devote additional resources to our operational, financial and management information systems procedures and controls to ensure our continued compliance with current and future laws and regulations, (ii) will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage, increase our level of self-insurance, or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage, and (iii) could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, or qualified executive officers. For example, to implement plans and measures to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and other related rules, we expended significant resources and incurred significant expenses. We are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result. Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could impair the reliability of our financial statements, cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the SEC, harm our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and include a report of management on our internal control over financial reporting (Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K each year. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the Form 10-K. Although our management and independent registered public accounting firm have concluded that no material weaknesses in our Companys internal control over financial reporting existed as of June 30, 2007, and although we believe that we are taking adequate measures to ensure that we maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting, we can not assure you that this will be the case in future periods. 35 Table of Contents The June 5, 2007 acquisition of a majority stake in OCP requires us to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting of OCPs financial position and statement of operations in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as of June 30, 2008. We have identified areas of internal controls requiring improvement in OCPs financial reporting processes, and plan to design enhanced processes and controls to address these and any other issues that might be identified through a review. As a result, we expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of managements time. We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations and may not be able to ensure that the process is effective or that the internal controls are or will be effective in a timely manner over the financial reporting of OCPs financial position and statement of operations. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 at OCP in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the SEC. As a result, there could be an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements as well as in our ability to integrate and manage OCP. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel. Any such action could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If, in the future, our management is unable to assert in the Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting to be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for any fiscal year that Oplinks internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of such fiscal year, or if Oplinks independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is fairly stated or it is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of Oplinks internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our consolidated financial statements could be impaired, we may be unable to timely file with the SEC our Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year and Oplinks reputation could be harmed, any of which could adversely affect our stock price. In addition, if we are not otherwise able to maintain adequate compliance with of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we could become subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or The NASDAQ Stock Market. Changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices may adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in existing accounting rules or practices, new accounting pronouncements or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business. Further, such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective. For example, for purposes of our 2005 fiscal year quarterly and annual financial reports, we were not required to expense stock compensation charges in connection with stock option grants to our employees and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. Recent changes to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidelines relating to accounting for stock compensation increased our compensation expense starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS 123(R)) could make our net income/loss less predictable in any given reporting period and could harm our business. To mitigate future impact, we may revise our equity compensation program, which may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Because of the rapid changes taking place in the fiber optics industry, we expect to experience significant volatility in our stock price, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Because of the rapid changes taking place in the fiber optics industry, we expect the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. For example, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated from a high sales price of $285.67 to a low sales price of $3.71 during the period from October 3, 2000, the date of our initial public offering, to June 30, 2007. These fluctuations may occur in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:  economic downturn in the fiber optics industry;  preannouncement of financial results; 36 Table of Contents  quarterly variations in our operating results;  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and our failure to meet estimates;  changes in market values of comparable companies;  announcements by our competitors or us of new products or of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures;  any loss by us of a major customer;  the outcome of, and costs associated with, any litigation to which we are or may become a party;  additions or departures of key management or engineering personnel; and  future sales of our common stock. The price of our common stock may also be affected by general economic and market conditions, and the cost of operations in our product markets. While we cannot predict the individual effect that these factors may have on the price of our common stock, these factors, either individually or in the aggregate, could result in significant variations in price during any given period of time and could adversely affect the trading prices of our common stock. Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law and other arrangements may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent any change in control, which could negatively affect your investment. Provisions of Delaware law and of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions permit us to:  issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders;  provide for a classified board of directors;  eliminate the right of the stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;  eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent; and  impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. In addition, on March 18, 2002, our Board of Directors adopted a share purchase rights plan, which has certain additional anti-takeover effects. Specifically, the terms of the plan provide for a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock. These rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Uncertainties arising out of terrorist activities, resulting military actions and other factors could adversely affect our business and operating results. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States and recent terrorist attacks in other parts of the world, as well as continued threats of global terrorism, current and future military response to them, the United States military action in Iraq, and the potential outbreak of Avian Flu have created many economic and political uncertainties that make it extremely difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. The potential outbreak of Avian Flu, especially in China, where we have significant customer and supply relationships, could also disrupt our operations, sales, and supply chain or those of our customers, which has made it more difficult to predict and plan for future business activities. This reduced predictability challenges our ability to operate profitably or to grow our business. In particular, it is difficult to develop and implement strategies, sustainable business models and efficient operations, and effectively manage 37 Table of Contents contract manufacturing and supply chain relationships. In addition, the continued threats of terrorism, the heightened security measures in response to such threats, and the potential outbreak of Avian Flu have caused and may continue to cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world. Disruption in air transportation in response to these threats or future attacks, or Avian Flu, may result in transportation and supply-chain disruptions, increase our costs for both receipt of inventory and shipment of products to our customers, and cause customers to defer their purchasing decisions. Disruptions in commerce could also cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. We may also become subject to the risk that future restrictions of immigration controls may adversely affect the residence status of non-U.S.-citizen engineers and other key technical employees or our ability to hire new non-U.S.-citizen employees.
