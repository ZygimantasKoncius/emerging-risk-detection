ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) Intermecs financial results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to its estimated tax liabilities in the periods when the tax assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitations on the tax assessments expire. The outcome of these tax assessments could have a material positive or negative impact on Intermecs earnings and increase the volatility of its earnings relative to prior periods. · Changes or disruptions in Intermecs outsourcing arrangements could have a material adverse impact on its operations and financial results. From time to time, Intermec outsources the manufacture, production, delivery, installation or service of its products or systems or outsources elements of its back-office operations such as order taking and order entry systems, customer service and support systems, information technology systems and financial systems. Changes in the mix of Intermecs internal and outsourced operations may be necessary or appropriate in the future and it is possible that outsourced operations may have to be moved from one vendor to another with little or no advance notice. The process of implementing such changes and dealing with such disruptions is complex. There is no assurance that Intermec will be able to accomplish these tasks at all or in an efficient or cost-effective manner. If Intermec encounters difficulties in making such transitions, its revenues, gross profit margins and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not Applicable.
