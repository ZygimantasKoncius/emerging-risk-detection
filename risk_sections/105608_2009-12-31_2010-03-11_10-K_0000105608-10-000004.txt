RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY Technology changes as required by our customers could limit and impair our ability to produce products. We are currently predominantly dependent on LCD based technology. We are continuing to develop our expertise and broaden our product line in LCD based technology. As we continue to participate in developing solutions for future technological applications for our customers such as 3D, organic light emitting diode (“OLED”), transmissive, flexible, and round LCDs, the need for us to be able to provide a value-added component to the technology remains a critical issue. Technology changes may also negatively affect margins. The Company may have to ramp up production in new technologies more rapidly than it is prepared to accomplish due to customer demand and experience very low margins as a result. Although this has not been a major problem for the Company during the last three years, 2009, 2008 and 2007, it could again become an issue in the future. The loss or interruption of supply from our key suppliers could limit our ability to manufacture our products. We purchase certain materials and components for our products from various suppliers, some of which are located outside of the U.S. We are obtaining all our LCD chassis subassembly supply primarily from two sources. Any loss or interruption of supply from our key suppliers may require us to find new suppliers. The number of suppliers for certain electronic components and raw materials is limited. We could experience production or development delays while we seek new suppliers and could have difficulty finding new suppliers, which would substantially impair our operating results and business. Our growth could be impaired if we are not able to continue to develop and maintain the success of our Asian subcontract relationships. Our Asian subcontract relationships for LCD video displays and chassis are an important part of our revenue and earnings plan. If we are unable to continue to successfully execute this strategy with our current LCD subcontractors, we may not be able to maintain our revenues and earnings as expected. The loss of our significant customer Aristocrat would reduce our revenues and our profitability. Our largest customer, Aristocrat Technologies Pty. Ltd., with whom we have an exclusive supply agreement for 19” LCDs through June, 2012, accounted for 35%, 40% and 35% of total revenues in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, and 45%, 36%, and 37% of total accounts receivable in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. A loss of this contract or customer would significantly reduce our revenues and profitability. The goodwill of our American Gaming & Electronics acquisition in 2000 could become impaired. The Company is required to measure the potential impairment of the goodwill related to our 2000 acquisition of American Gaming & Electronics per FASB ASC 350-20, Goodwill Subsequent Measurement, at least annually. The goodwill amount on our balance sheet at December 31, 2009 and 2008 is $1,329,000. The measurement of the American Gaming & Electronics reporting unit Fair Value requires certain management assumptions regarding future sales, gross margins, operating expense, effective tax rates, and net working capital requirements. The 2009 year end analysis assumed that AGE was going to become a distributor in the Illinois Video Lottery terminal market in addition to its usual replacement kit, parts, service and used game distribution activities. The analysis also requires the Company to determine appropriate discount rates for the next five years, the perpetuity growth and discount rate, and the perpetuity tax rate. To the extent that the indicated Fair Value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, then there is no indicated impairment. Conversely, in the event that the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it indicated Fair Value then some level of goodwill impairment has potentially occurred and additional analysis is necessary to quantify the level of impairment (i.e. Step II), if any. The Company passed the step I test at December 31, 2009 and 2008; therefore there was no impairment. However, there is no certainty in future periods that the Fair Value of the American Gaming & Electronics reporting unit will exceed its carrying value, particularly due to the recent volatility in the used game market and current general economic conditions. Intense competition in our industry could impair our ability to grow and achieve profitability. We may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors. The market for our products and services is intensely -5- TABLE OF CONTENTS competitive and constantly attracts new competitors even as others leave the industry due to low barriers to entry to our business. We expect this competition to further intensify in the future. Some of our competitors are large companies with greater financial, marketing and product development resources. In addition, new competitors may enter our key markets. This may place us at a disadvantage in responding to our competitors’ pricing strategies, technological advances and other initiatives. The gaming business is heavily regulated and we depend on our ability to obtain/maintain regulatory approvals. The manufacture and distribution of parts for gaming machines are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulations, and the governments of the various gaming jurisdictions amend these regulations from time to time. Virtually all of these jurisdictions require licenses, permits, documentation of qualification, including evidence of financial stability, and other forms of approval for manufacturers and distributors of gaming machines and for their key personnel. The revocation or denial of a license in a particular jurisdiction could adversely affect our ability to obtain or maintain licenses in other jurisdictions. Also, there is always the potential that laws and regulations could be changed or repealed, even after their adoption. These changes could affect our business and results of operations. The loss of our bank line would severely limit our ability to fund operations. Our current bank line expires August 21, 2013 and requires the Company to maintain certain financial covenants. The Company fully intends to maintain compliance with the covenants under its bank line and expects it will be able to do so. If unsuccessful, the Company would be severely limited in its ability to fund operations. The market price for our shares is susceptible to significant changes in market price. Historically, the volume of trading of our shares has been small. As a result, larger than average buy or sell orders on a given day, or news about us or the gaming industry, has had and may in the future have a significant impact on the trading price for our shares. The current economic conditions might cause sales to decline without warning making it difficult to reduce costs fast enough to maintain profitability. The Company is concerned that our customers and their customers business might decline more than they currently are forecasting making it difficult for us to reduce our expenses as fast as our sales decline. Although the Company will make every effort to keep our expenses in line with current sales, we could experience periods where the sales decline occurs so rapidly that we are unprofitable for a period of time.
