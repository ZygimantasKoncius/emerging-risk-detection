Risk Factors—Risks relating to our operations in Latin America—Political and economic developments in Latin America countries in which we operate, may adversely affect us.” 34 The following table shows our sales of sawn lumber, MDF and particle board in Venezuela in millions of U.S. dollars for the indicated periods. VENEZUELA PRINCIPAL WOOD PRODUCTS SALES Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$) 2004 2005 2006 Solid Wood and Forestry Sawn lumber 7.3 14.9 [* ] Boards MDF 24.1 37.0 [* ] Particle board 7.6 9.1 [* ] Marketing and distribution We sell most of our products in Venezuela through approximately 31 independent distributors serving the furniture manufacturing and construction industries. Our 20 largest solid wood and forestry product customers accounted for approximately 86% and [*]% of our solid wood and forestry sales in Venezuela for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Our largest solid wood and forestry products customer accounted for approximately 12% and [*]%, respectively, of these sales for such periods. Our principal solid wood products customers in Venezuela are Grupo Imeca, Madenova C.A. and Madera La Ojedeña C.A. Our 20 largest board product customers accounted for approximately 95% and [*]% of our board sales in Venezuela for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Our largest board products customer accounted for approximately 22% and [*]%, respectively, of these sales for such periods. Our principal board products customers in Venezuela are Aserradero El Sol C.A., Grupo Imeca and Madenova C.A. Although we do not believe that, under current market conditions, the loss of any one distributor or customer would have a material adverse effect on us, there can be no assurance that any such loss in the future will not have such a material adverse effect. Our products are stored in two warehouses, at our Macapaima plant and in Puerto Cabello and are shipped mainly by truck to domestic customer locations. We also have a sales office in Caracas, Venezuela. The wood products we sell in the Venezuelan market are produced at our Macapaima plant in Anazoategui, Venezuela. In 2006, Masisa successfully expanded its Placacentros network in Venezuela. As of December 31, 2006, Masisa Venezuela had 22 stores located throughout the country and expects to grow its network by 12 additional stores during 2007. Solid wood and forestry Sawn lumber market. We sell sawn lumber to distributors and pallet manufacturers and other industries in Venezuela. Our total sales of sawn lumber for the year ended December 31, 2006 were US$[*] million compared to US$14.9 million for the same period in 2005. This increase in sawn lumber sales was primarily due to a decrease in demand for native timber species that compete with our lumber, as well as an increase in demand by pallet manufacturers for the food industry. All of the sawn lumber we sell in Venezuela is harvested at our plantations in the Uverito area, and processed at our sawmill, in the Macapaima complex in Anazoategui, Venezuela. The sawn lumber market in Venezuela had historically been dominated by wood species native to Venezuela and imported radiata pine from Chile. Caribbean pine wood is relatively new to the Venezuelan market, but demand is growing fast due to the high quality of caribbean pine wood and demand for quality wood from the construction and pallet manufacturing industries. In addition, due to the Venezuelan government’s policy of limiting the exploitation of native wood species, we believe that there will be a significant increase in the amount of imported radiata pine from Chile as well as caribbean pine wood. We believe demand from pallet manufacturers will be more important in the coming years due to the fact that the distribution industries are increasingly converting to palletized systems and new regulations in packaging, which support the use of standardized pallets. Our principal competitors in this market are smaller volume domestic sawmills including Aserradero Carabobo, Forestal Soledad and Pinoven. 35 Boards MDF market. We sell MDF to distributors in Venezuela. Our total MDF sales in 2006 were US$[*] million compared to US$37.0 million for the same period in 2005. The increase in MDF sales was primarily due to higher prices and greater physical sales volume, which stemmed from improved domestic economic conditions. All of the MDF board we sell in Venezuela is produced at our Macapaima plant in Anzoátegui, Venezuela. We believe we have an advantage in this market as a domestic competitor. We also believe sales through our Venezuelan Placacentros network will enable us to increase sales significantly. Particle board market. Our businesses sell raw and melamine-coated particle board to distributors in Venezuela. Our total particle board sales in 2006 were US$[*] million compared to US$9.1 million in 2005. This increase in particle board sales was primarily due to higher prices and greater physical sales volume, which stemmed from improved domestic economic conditions. All of the particle board we sell in Venezuela is produced at our Macapaina plant in Anzoátegui, Venezuela. Sales of particle board in Venezuela declined greatly in 2002 and 2003 as a result of economic instability and a general economic recession. The market began to improve in 2004, and has continued to improve through 2006. As the local market improves, we are focusing on developing our boards and melamine products to support this growing market. Argentina General For the year ended December 31, 2006, GDP grew 8.5%, inflation was 9.8% and the trade balance surplus was US$8.1 billion. At December 31, 2006, the unemployment rate was 8.7%. The Argentinean economy has continued to show strong growth since 2003 and has supported the growth of the local construction and furniture industries. As a result of the increased demand for wood products to support the growth of these industries, the particle board and MDF board demand has equaled, and in some instances surpassed, the levels achieved for these products during the late 1990s. The following table shows our MDF, particle board, OSB and MDF mouldings sales in Argentina in millions of U.S. dollars for the indicated periods. ARGENTINA PRINCIPAL WOOD PRODUCTS SALES Year ended December 31, (in millions of US$) 2004 2005 2006 Boards MDF 21.4 28.1 [* ] Particle board 15.8 20.5 [* ] OSB 1.9 2.2 [* ] MDF mouldings 0.2 0.3 [* ] Marketing and distribution Argentina has more than twice the population of Chile and has a significant housing deficit. However, following the devaluation of its currency on January 2002, Argentina’s per capita income was reduced to half of its pre-devaluation levels. The low per capita consumption is primarily the result of this economic crisis. As Argentina’s economy has recovered, demand for Masisa’s products has recovered as well. We expect that future demand for Masisa’s products in Argentina will be largely dependent upon the growth of the Argentinean economy and particularly on the growth of the Argentinean construction and furniture manufacturing industries. 36 We sell particle board and MDF to Argentinean furniture manufacturers through approximately 150 distributors. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, approximately 69% and [*]% of our total sales in the Argentinean market were generated by 20 principal distributors, respectively. The largest customer accounted for approximately [*]% of these sales during each of these periods. Masisa’s principal distributors in Argentina are Cencosud S.A., Distribuidora Aglolam S.A., Distribuidora Argentina de Chapas S.A.C., Distribuidora Placasur S.A., Dolinsky S.A., Maderas Amiano S.R.L., Madergold S.A., NBC Maderas S.R.L., Sacheco S.A. and Taru Parq S.R.L. Given the successful development of Masisa’s Placacentro program in Chile and Peru, Masisa Argentina started to develop this distribution channel in 2000. As of December 31, 2006, 51 stores were managed from Argentina (47 in Argentina, 1 in Uruguay and 3 in Paraguay). Masisa Argentina expects to grow its network by 7 additional stores in Argentina in 2007. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, approximately [*]% of our total sales in Argentina in each year were made through the Argentinean Placacentros network. We have focused our marketing efforts on furniture and cabinet manufacturers and on the construction industry. We are pursuing several strategies in Argentina to encourage the use of our particle board and MDF products in lieu of other materials currently favored by local manufacturers. As in Chile, we hold regular meetings with Argentinean furniture manufacturers, offer service and technical assistance to these consumers and regularly participate in trade fairs and furniture shows. In addition, we offer technical training courses for Masisa-product installers. After the devaluation of the Argentinean peso in 2002 and in response to the adverse macroeconomic scenario in Argentina, Masisa Argentina redirected the majority of the production from its Argentinean operations to export markets primarily in Brazil, Mexico, the United States and the Far East. However, with the recovery of the Argentinean local market, this trend has been reversed. MDF Market. We have continued to actively develop the market for this product through advertising campaigns, events held directly with our customers and our participation in trade shows, all of which are designed to demonstrate the board’s quality and multiple uses for furniture manufacturers, architects and decorators. Masisa is the largest MDF manufacturer in the Argentinean market. Our total MDF board sales in 2006 were US$[*] million compared to US$28.1 million in 2005. The increase in MDF board sales was due primarily to greater sales volume and higher local prices as a result of strong local demand in 2006. We believe the positive growth trend in the Argentinean economy will continue in the short-term and that the market for wood board products will continue to recover as a result. However, there can be no assurance that the economy will continue to recover or that sales of wood board products will increase as a result. Alto Paraná (Paneles Arauco) and Tableros Guillermina S.A. are our only competitors in the Argentinean MDF market. Particle Board Market. Masisa is one of the three largest particle board manufacturers in the Argentinean market. Masisa’s principal Argentinean competitors in particle board are Alto Paraná (Faplac S.A.), Cuyoplacas S.A. and Sadepan Latinoamericana S.A. There are other smaller Argentinean particle board producers, such as Tableros del Paraná S.A., who have a minimal market presence and use older and less efficient technology than Masisa utilizes at its Concordia facility. As in Chile, particle board products compete with other types of board products, such as gypsum, as well as solid wood and plywood. Our total particle board sales in 2006 increased to US$[*] million compared to US$20.5 million in 2005, due to strong local demand. The large increases in sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004 follow a steep decline in 2002, when, in order to minimize the impact of the devaluation, Masisa Argentina shifted particle board sales to exports. Other markets Colombia We sell particle board and MDF products in the Colombian market mainly through exports from Venezuela. Our particle board sales in Colombia increased by [*]% from US$10.6 million in 2005 to US$[*] million in 2006. The growth of such sales was principally due to strong demand for particle boards. Our MDF board sales in Colombia increased by [*]% in dollar terms, from US$11.7 million in 2005 to US$[*] million in 2006. As in the case of particle board, the increase in MDF board sales was principally due to strong demand. 37 During 2006, we opened seven Placacentros stores in Colombia. As of December 31, 2006, 28 Placacentros were operating in Colombia. Perú We sell particle board and MDF products into the Peruvian market mainly through exports from Chile. We established our Peruvian subsidiary, Masisa Peru, in 1999 to conduct commercial and distribution activities in that country. Our board sales in Peru increased by [*]% from US$15.9 million in 2005 to US$[*] million in 2006. This increase in our board sales was principally due to deeper market penetration through our Placacentro distribution network and the selling and marketing efforts of our MDF board products and strong demand for particle board. As of December 31, 2006, 21 Placacentros were operating in Peru. We expect to grow the network by adding three new stores in Peru during 2007. Ecuador We sell MDF and particle board products into the Ecuadorian market mainly through exports from Venezuela and Chile. We established Masisa Ecuador in 2002 to conduct commercial and distribution activities in that country. Its main address is located in the city of Guayaquil. Our board sales in Ecuador increased by [*]% from US$7.4 million in 2005 to US$[*] million in 2006. The increase in our board sales was principally due to deeper market penetration through our Placacentro distribution network and the selling and marketing efforts of our MDF board products. As of December 31, 2006, 15 Placacentros stores were operating in Ecuador. We expect to grow the network by adding three new stores in Ecuador during 2007. Other Our board businesses generally achieve higher margins from the sale of their principal products in the markets in which they participate directly (Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela) than from exports to third markets (i.e. Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, China, Guatemala, Uruguay, Germany, Italy, among others). Accordingly, our board businesses have traditionally preferred to satisfy demand in their respective markets first, and then export any surplus products. However, we have built a solid business network outside the markets in which we have manufacturing capacity in order to diversify our market risk and to enable us to respond promptly to changes in market conditions in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela. After the political and economic crisis began in Argentina in 2002, we utilized this export network and experience to substitute lost sales in the Argentinean market for sales to foreign markets. This was possible as a result of the increased competitiveness of products produced in Argentina resulting from the currency devaluation in that country. Approximately [*]% of our consolidated net sales in 2006 were derived from U.S., Chilean, Mexican, Brazilian, Venezuelan and Argentinean export sales to markets other than United States, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina, compared to the approximately 10.5% of our consolidated net sales in 2005. Production As of December 31, 2006 we owned and operated production facilities in Chile, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, the United States and Mexico. Our Chilean production facilities are located in Cabrero, Coronel, Chiguayante, Valdivia and Chillán. Our Venezuelan production facilities are located in Macapaima, near the city of Puerto Ordaz in the southern part of the state of Anzoátegui. Our Brazilian production facilities are located in Rio Negrinho in the State of Santa Catarina and Ponta Grossa in the State of Paraná. Our Argentinean production facilities are located in Concordia, in the province of Entre Rios. Our U.S. production facilities were located in Charleston, South Carolina. In February 2007, as part of a cost reduction program, we closed the Charleston MDF moulding plant (i.e. 36,000 cubic meters, representing 9% of our total moulding capacity). Most of the industrial assets will be relocated to our industrial complex in Cabrero, Chile. Our Mexican production facilities are located in Durango, in the state of Nuevo León. 38 Our production by country Chile The following table sets forth for each of our Chilean production lines the installed annual production capacity in cubic meters as of December 31, 2006. CHILE WOOD PRODUCTS PRODUCTION LINES Plant Line Product Annual installed capacity(1) Cabrero (Solid wood) Sawmill Various 337,000 Finger-joint mouldings Finger-joint mouldings 103,000 MDF mouldings MDF mouldings 52,000 Cabrero (Boards) MDF MDF 160,000 Chiguayante (Boards) Line 1 Particle board 82,000 Laminating Melamine board 45,000 Chillán (Solid wood) Doors Solid wood doors 42,000 Mapal (Boards) Line 1 Particle board 95,000 Line 2 Particle board 60,000 MDF MDF 140,000 Laminating Melamine board 110,000 Puschmann (Boards) Line 1 Particle board 86,000 Valdivia (Boards) Line 1 Particle board 90,000 Laminating Melamine board 55,000 Veneering Wood-veneered board 40,000 Doors Fiberboard doors 500,000 (1) Units are in cubic meters, except fiberboard doors, which are in square meters. The annual installed capacity may vary slightly depending upon the thickness of the boards produced and other production factors. Actual production can exceed capacity because capacity is estimated assuming an average board thickness and actual board thickness may vary. Cabrero (Solid Wood). Our Cabrero solid wood facilities are located in city of Cabrero, Chile. Its operations include a sawmill and wood drying unit and plants for the production of finger-joint mouldings, MDF mouldings and solid wood doors. Sawmill. Our sawmill in Cabrero was constructed during 2000 and reached full operational capacity in May 2001. It was constructed to replace our then-existing Cabrero sawmill, which we had operated for 15 years and which we still partially operate. The new mill is a state-of-the-art facility equipped with a software control system that provides automatic control of the production line and allows for a high speed production line. The software system also uses special scanners and sensors for the cutting of wood and offers automatic packaging. With this new equipment, the volume of processed wood has increased to 106.8 cubic meters per hour, and the yield of wood per log has increased by 1%. Maintenance costs have also increased due to the technological change, but the labor requirement has fallen from around 180 people to approximately 52 people. Since May 2001, the new sawmill has increased wood processing volumes and volumetric output with a corresponding decrease in by-products production. The sawmill currently has a maximum annual yield of 337,000 cubic meters of sawn wood, the majority of which is used in the production of finger-joint mouldings and solid wood doors. 39 The solid wood industrial complexes also include drying facilities in Cabrero. Their annual operational capacity is sufficient to dry most saw lumber currently produced at the Cabrero sawmill. This enables us to manufacture our wood products with kiln-dried wood with a moisture content of 12% or less. Finger-joint moulding plant. The finger-joint moulding plant has an annual production capacity of approximately 103,000 cubic meters. We designed and constructed this plant to produce high-quality linear mouldings and doorframes of various styles intended for use in interior architecture. Within these product lines, we manufacture products meeting a variety of standardized design specifications as well as custom made products designed and finished according to specifications supplied by our customers. MDF moulding lines. In June 2004, we added an MDF moulding line with an annual production capacity of 34,000 cubic meters. In August 2005, a new MDF moulding line was added to this facility, increasing our production capacity to 52,000 cubic meters per year. Cabrero (Boards). This plant has been operating since August 1992. It has a single MDF board line with an annual production capacity of 160,000 cubic meters. It is expected that in July 2007, a new MDF plant will start operations, increasing our production capacity by approximately 340,000 cubic meters per year. The estimated total investment of this new MDF plant is approximately US$93.0 million. This new plant will be oriented to the export market. Mapal. Our Mapal industrial site, which is located in Coronel near the city of Concepción, 320 miles south of Santiago, has two particle board lines, one MDF line and one melamine-laminating line, which includes a melamine impregnating line. The two particle board production lines have an aggregate annual production capacity of approximately 155,000 cubic meters: one for thin particle board (60,000 cubic meters per year capacity) and another for thicker boards (95,000 cubic meters per year capacity). The MDF line commenced operations in January 1996, and has an annual production capacity of approximately 140,000 cubic meters. The melamine paper impregnating line produces most of the melamine paper used by our melamine-laminating lines. The Mapal facility laminates a portion of its total particle board and MDF production. An additional melamine-laminating line in the Mapal plant began full operations in 2003, with an annual production capacity of 110,000 cubic meters, replacing an existing melamine-laminating line. We increased melamine production capacity through this new line in response to an increase in demand for melamine-laminated products generated by our developing Placacentros network, as well as an anticipated increase in demand for such boards in our Chilean and export markets. Chiguayante. Our Chiguayante facility is located 16 miles from our Mapal facility. The Chiguayante facility has a single particle board line with an annual production capacity of approximately 82,000 cubic meters. We upgraded the facility in 1994 so that particle board manufactured at Chiguayante would be similar in quality to that produced at the Mapal facility. The Chiguayante plant also has a melamine-laminating line with an annual production capacity of approximately 45,000 cubic meters. Chillán. The doors plant, located in the city of Chillán, has an annual production capacity of approximately 42,000 cubic meters of solid wood doors. This plant was designed to manufacture products primarily for the United States and other North American markets. Its principal products are solid raised-panel pine wood interior stile and rail doors. We produce our solid wood doors in a range of widths and market them for use as interior and closet doors. The stiles and rails are composed of a finger-jointed center and a face made of laminated clear pine and thin MDF boards. The panels are edge-glued solid wood pieces with a double-hip profile. This structure gives the door substantial stability. Valdivia and Puschmann. We have two production complexes in Valdivia, a city located approximately 520 miles south of Santiago. The main facility is referred to as the “Valdivia” plant and has an annual production capacity of approximately 90,000 cubic meters of particle board. The second facility is named “Puschmann”, in memory of Carlos Puschmann, a distinguished Masisa employee who passed away in 1999. 40 Masisa acquired the Puschmann plant for US$17.0 million in August 1998 when it purchased the assets of Tableros Nobel S.A., which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infodema S.A. (“lnfodema”). The Puschmann facility has an annual production capacity of approximately 86,000 cubic meters of particle board. In addition to producing raw particle board, the Valdivia plant produces melamine-laminated boards, wood-veneered particle board and all of the fiberboard doors produced by Masisa in Chile. The melamine-laminating line and the wood-veneering line have estimated annual production capacities of 55,000 cubic meters and 40,000 cubic meters, respectively. Our fiberboard door production line is located in the same facility and has an estimated annual production capacity of 500,000 square meters. During 2006 the wood veneer strips line was closed. As a result, 66 employees left the company in December 2006, and 25 left during the first quarter of 2007. The capacity utilization rate for our sawmill production facility in Chile was 97% in 2006 compared to 100% in 2005. The capacity utilization rate for our finger-joint moulding production facilities in Chile was 91% in 2006 compared to 86% in 2005. The capacity utilization rate for our solid wood doors production facilities in Chile was 91% in 2006 compared to 93% in 2005. The capacity utilization rate for our particle board production facilities in Chile was 91% in 2006 compared to 87% in 2005. The capacity utilization rate for our MDF production facilities in Chile was 100% in 2006, the same as in 2005. The capacity utilization rate for our MDF moulding production facilities in Chile was 83% in 2006 compared to 64% in 2005. It is important to note that actual production can exceed capacity because capacity is estimated assuming an average board thickness and actual board thickness may vary. Brazil The following table sets forth for each of our Brazilian production lines the product manufactured and the installed annual production capacity in cubic meters as of December 31, 2006. BRAZIL WOOD PRODUCTS PRODUCTION LINES Plant Line Product Annual installed capacity(1) Ponta Grossa (Boards) Line 1 MDF 280,000 OSB OSB 300,000 Laminating Melamine board 220,000 Rio Negrinho (Solid wood) Finger-joint mouldings Finger-joint mouldings 65,000 Sawmill Various 220,000 (1) Units are in cubic meters. The annual installed capacity may vary slightly depending upon the thickness of the boards produced and other production factors. Actual production can exceed capacity because capacity is estimated assuming an average board thickness and actual board thickness may vary. Ponta Grossa. In December 2000, we finished the construction of our MDF production facility in the city of Ponta Grossa, in the State of Paraná, Brazil. Originally, this facility had an annual installed production capacity of 240,000 cubic meters and reached full production during the second half of 2001. During 2006, additional investments in this facility were made, increasing the annual production capacity to 280,000 cubic meters. In the same complex, with a total investment cost of US$8.0 million, we installed two melamine-laminating lines that are used for coating MDF and particle board. These laminating lines have a total annual production capacity of approximately 220,000 cubic meters. Also, in May 2006, we finished construction of a new paper impregnation line in the Ponta Grossa facility that is used to supply melamine paper for the laminating line. This line required an investment of approximately US$4.0 million and has an annual installed production capacity of 36 million square meters. The capacity utilization rate for the MDF production facility in Brazil was 102% in 2006 compared to 94% in 2005. The capacity utilization rate for melamine laminating facilities in Brazil was 74% in 2006 compared to 65% in 2005. 41 The Ponta Grossa OSB plant is the first of its type in Brazil. The plant has an annual installed production capacity of 300,000 cubic meters and became fully operational during the fourth quarter of 2002. The capacity utilization rate for Masisa Brazil OSB production facilities in Brazil was 63% in 2006 and 87% in 2005. The OSB plant’s production has been adjusted to match the lower demand observed for this product. Rio Negrinho. We began operations at Masisa Madeiras Limitada (“Masisa Madeiras,” formerly known as Terranova Brasil) in 1997 with the acquisition of a sawmill and pine plantations. The saw logs harvested from Masisa Madeiras’ plantations are processed at its sawmill located in Rio Negrinho in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The 32,000 square meter industrial plant includes a sawmill and a finger-joint moulding processing plant. Masisa Madeiras currently has three principal product lines which are sold to three markets: finger-joint mouldings oriented to the United States; door parts exported to Chile; and sawn lumber for pallet manufacturers in Brazil. Masisa Madeiras’ mouldings plant is designed to produce mouldings which meet specifications for sale into the U.S. market. The plant’s principal products are raw and primed seven, fourteen and sixteen foot finger-joint mouldings and door frames. These products are then sold through Masisa USA to distributors and wholesalers. Currently, all door parts produced at the Rio Negrinho plant are sold to our plant in Chillán, Chile, where our solid wood doors are produced. We produce door parts in a variety of widths (e.g., 2 ½, 5 and 5 ½ inches), lengths (e.g., 24 ½ and 45 inches and 7 feet), and thicknesses (e.g., 3/4, 5/4 and 6/4 inches). The total volume of door parts produced by Masisa Madeiras depends on the quality of the logs and the drying process. Currently, the Rio Negrinho plant produces up to 1,200 cubic meters per month of door components. Wood processed and sold for use in pallet manufacturing is taken from the center of the log. Most of the wood processed by Masisa Madeiras for this purpose is sold in Brazil, where it undergoes further processing or is sold directly to the end-user. The capacity utilization rate for our finger-joint moulding production facilities in Brazil was 86% in 2006 compared to 91% in 2005. The capacity utilization rate for our sawmill production facilities in Brazil was 86% in 2006 compared to 82% in 2005. Venezuela The following table sets forth for each of our Venezuelan production lines the product manufactured and the installed annual production capacity in cubic meters as of December 31, 2006. VENEZUELA WOOD PRODUCTS PRODUCTION LINES Plant Line Product Annual installed capacity(1) Andinos (Solid wood) Sawmill Various 150,000 Fibranova (Boards) Lines 1 & 2 Particle board 120,000 Line 1 MDF 250,000 Line 1 Melamine boards 60,000 Line 1 MDF mouldings 12,000 (1) Units are in cubic meters. The annual installed capacity may vary slightly depending upon the thickness of the boards produced and other production factors. Actual production can exceed capacity because capacity is estimated assuming an average board thickness and actual board thickness may vary. Andinos CA. We completed construction of our Andinos sawmill in November of 2000. The sawmill is located in Puerto Ordaz in the Macapaima Industrial Complex, in the southern part of the state of Anzoátegui, Venezuela. The sawmill’s equipment and machinery are designed to process logs of varying diameters as required by the market and custom orders, and have an annual production capacity of 150,000 cubic meters. The sawmill includes a treated log yard with a 20,000 square meter paved area and dryer kilns where we dry 100% of the production. 42 The pine-sawn lumber produced by the Andinos sawmill is characterized by high density, small firm knots, and greater hardness. Our sawn lumber is used primarily in the manufacturing of pallets and packages. A smaller percentage is sold for use in ceiling and furniture construction. During 2006, we began an expansion project for this sawmill, which it is expected to be finished during 2007. The capacity utilization rate for our sawmill production facilities in Venezuela was 72% in 2006 compared to 95% in 2005. Fibranova C.A. Our Fibranova plant processes intermediate wood products to produce MDF board and particle board. Its facilities are located also in Macapaima, Puerto Ordaz and include two processing lines for the production of particle board and MDF board, and a third line for the covering of melamine-laminated board. From January 2003 through the effective time of our merger with Masisa in 2005, this plant was administered and managed by our former subsidiary, Masisa, pursuant to a management contract. Since the merger, the contract has been assumed by us. The raw material used in the production process is supplied by the caribbean pine plantations managed by Terranova Venezuela and from the chips and other by-products produced by the Andinos sawmill. Fibranova’s installations have a current annual production capacity of 120,000 cubic meters of particle board, 250,000 cubic meters of MDF board, 60,000 cubic meters of melamine-laminated boards and 12,000 cubic meters of MDF mouldings. In 1999, we formed a joint venture with Establecimientos Industriales Oxiquim S.A., a Chilean resins manufacturer, to provide resin to Fibranova C.A.’s production processes. The joint venture began operations in July 2001 and is called Oxinova C.A., a Venezuelan corporation. Oxinova currently produces and supplies resin to our board production plants in Venezuela. The capacity utilization rate for our particle board production facilities in Venezuela was 89% in 2006 compared to 78% in 2005. The capacity utilization rate for our MDF production facilities in Venezuela was 97% in 2006 compared to 88% in 2005. Our MDF mouldings production facilities in Venezuela suspended its operations due to strong local market demand for MDF boards, which is the principal raw material for this product. Accordingly, in 2006 the capacity utilization rate for our MDF mouldings production facilities in Venezuela was 0% compared to 2% in 2005. 43 Argentina The following table sets forth for each of our Argentinean production lines the product manufactured and the installed annual production capacity in cubic meters as of December 31, 2006. ARGENTINA WOOD PRODUCTS PRODUCTION LINES Plant Line Product Annual installed capacity(1) Concordia (Boards) Line 1 Particle board 160,000 Line 2 Particle board 25,000 MDF MDF 150,000 Thin-MDF Thin-MDF 120,000 Laminating Melamine board 200,000 Foil Foil-lined board 48,000 Moulding MDF mouldings 104,400 (1) Units are in cubic meters. The annual installed capacity may vary slightly depending upon the thickness of the boards produced and other production factors. Actual production can exceed capacity because capacity is estimated assuming an average board thickness and actual board thickness may vary. Masisa Argentina’s production facilities are located in Concordia, an industrial town in the Province of Entre Rios on the Uruguay River, approximately 250 miles north of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Concordia particle board production facility has the capacity to produce 185,000 cubic meters per year of raw particle board in two lines. The particle board line for thin particle board (under nine millimeters) has an annual production capacity of 25,000 cubic meters. The particle board line for greater board thickness has an annual production capacity of 160,000 cubic meters. The Concordia facility commenced operations in June 1994. The capacity utilization rate for Masisa Argentina’s particle board production facilities was 99% in 2006 compared to 85% in 2005 In September 1995, Masisa Argentina completed the installation of an MDF facility adjacent to its particle board facilities. In 1997 Masisa increased this MDF facility’s annual production capacity from 120,000 cubic meters to 138,000 cubic meters. In 1999, Masisa further increased its production capacity to 150,000 cubic meters. In October 2001, Masisa Argentina completed the construction of a thin-MDF plant at the Concordia Industrial Complex. The plant, which became fully operational by mid-2002, has an installed capacity of 120,000 cubic meters per year and represented an investment of approximately US$30.0 million. The capacity utilization rate for Masisa Argentina’s MDF production facilities was 94% in 2006 compared to 88% in 2005. The Concordia plant also includes a melamine-laminating line with an installed capacity of 200,000 cubic meters per year, as well as a foil lining process with an installed capacity of 48,000 cubic meters per year. In March 2002, Masisa Argentina began construction of its first line of pre-painted MDF mouldings in Argentina at the Concordia Industrial Complex. Production at the MDF moulding plant is primarily directed to the United States. This line became fully operational during the second quarter of 2003. An additional 36,000 cubic meters of production capacity was added during 2004. The current annual production capacity of 104,400 cubic meters was reached in February 2005 with the addition of a new production line. The capacity utilization rate for Masisa Argentina’s MDF mouldings production facilities was 69% in 2006 compared to 51% in 2005. The relatively low utilization rate during 2006 is primarly due to a focus on more profitable production. Accordingly, in 2006 we focused our selling and marketing efforts for our MDF boards on the local Argentinean market rather than exporting such boards as MDF mouldings to the United States, where given the downturn in the construction sector, pricing for this product was less attractive to us. The low utilization rate during 2005 was due mainly to the addition of increased capacity during this period. 44 Mexico The following table sets forth for each of our Mexican production lines the product manufactured and the installed annual production capacity in cubic meters as of December 31, 2006. MEXICO WOOD PRODUCTS PRODUCTION LINES Plant Line Product Annual installed capacity(1) Durango Line 1 Particle board 65,500 Line 2 Particle board 88,000 Laminating Melamine board 73,450 (1) Units are in cubic meters. The annual installed capacity may vary slightly depending upon the thickness of the boards produced and other production factors. Actual production can exceed capacity because capacity is estimated assuming an average board thickness and actual board thickness may vary. In December 2001, Masisa reached an agreement with Weyerhaeuser Company Limited to purchase from Weyerhaeuser’s subsidiary, MacMillan Guadiana, a particle board plant located in the city of Durango, Mexico. As of December 2006, the plant had a total installed capacity of 153,500 cubic meters per year in two independent production lines. The plant also includes a melamine-laminating line, with a total installed capacity of 21,600 cubic meters per year. In June 2005, the former Mapal, Chile melamine-laminating line started operating in Mexico, extending the capacity up to 73,450 cubic meters per year. The capacity utilization rate for Masisa Mexico’s particle board production facilities was 82% in 2006 compared to 92% in 2005. The capacity utilization rate for our melamine laminating facility in Mexico was 88% in 2006 compared to 57% in 2005. Most of the 2006 and 2005 production at this plant was directed toward the local market. United States The following table sets forth for each of our U.S. production line the product manufactured and the installed annual production capacity in cubic meters as of December 31, 2006. UNITED STATES WOOD PRODUCTS PRODUCTION LINES(2) Plant Line Product Annual installed capacity(1) Charleston, South Carolina MDF moulding MDF moulding 36,000 (1) Units are in cubic meters. The annual installed capacity may vary depending upon the thickness of the MDF mouldings produced, number of production shifts, and other production factors. Actual production can exceed capacity because capacity is estimated assuming an average board thickness and actual board thickness may vary. (2) In February 2007, as part of a cost reduction program, we closed the Charleston MDF moulding plant (i.e. 36,000 cubic meters, representing 9% of our total moulding capacity). Most of the industrial assets previously used at the Charleston, South Carolina plant will be relocated to our industrial complex in Cabrero, Chile. Masisa USA (formerly Terranova Forest Products, Inc.) was established to market and distribute our products in the United States as part of our strategy of locating our commercial operations as close to our customers as economically feasible. Terranova Forest Products was organized in 1993 as a joint venture with Fiberform Wood Products, Inc. under the name Fiberform Andinos Corporation. In January 1996, we purchased Fiberform’s interest in the joint venture and changed its name to Terranova Forest Products. In April 2005, Masisa USA moved its headquarters and marketing operations to Atlanta, Georgia. Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson airport serves as a major connecting hub serving destinations around the globe, providing easier access to our customers throughout the U.S. and to our world headquarters in Chile. 45 Our MDF mouldings line had a total installed capacity of 36,000 cubic meters per year. The capacity utilization rate for our MDF mouldings line was 67% in 2006 compared to 78% in 2005. As previously noted, in February 2007, as part of a cost reduction plan, we closed our MDF moulding plant in Charleston, South Carolina. Most of this production line will be relocated during 2007 to our Cabrero industrial complex, in Chile.
