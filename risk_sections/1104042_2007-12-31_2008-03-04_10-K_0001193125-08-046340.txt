ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production, and if we fail to forecast demand for our products accurately, we may incur product shortages, delays in product shipments or excess or insufficient product inventory. We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Because production lead times often exceed the amount of time required to fulfill orders, we often must build in advance of orders, relying on an imperfect demand forecast to project volumes and product mix. Our demand forecast accuracy can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including inaccurate forecasting by our customers, changes in market conditions, new part introductions by our competitors that lead to our loss of previous design wins, adverse changes in our product order mix and demand for our customers products or models. China, in particular, is an emerging market where forecasting by our distributors is not accurate, and there can be rapid changes in the distribution system and market conditions. Even after an order is received, our customers may cancel these orders or request a decrease in production quantities. Any such cancellation or decrease subjects us to a number of risks, most notably that our projected sales will not materialize on schedule or at all, leading to unanticipated revenue shortfalls and excess or obsolete inventory which we may be unable to sell to other customers. Alternatively, if we are unable to project customer requirements accurately, we may not build enough products, which could lead to delays in product shipments and lost sales opportunities in the near term, as well as force our customers to identify alternative sources, which could affect our ongoing relationships with these customers. We have in the past had customers dramatically increase their requested production quantities with little or no advance notice and after they had submitted their original order. We have on occasion been unable to fulfill these revised orders within the time period requested. Either underestimating or overestimating demand would lead to excess, obsolete or insufficient inventory, which could harm our operating results, cash flow and financial condition, as well as our relationships with our customers. We receive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of OEM customers and distributors, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from those customers or our other largest customers would adversely affect our operations and financial condition. We receive a substantial portion of our revenues from two of our OEM customers, LG Electronics Inc. of South Korea and Samsung of South Korea, as well as from one of our distributors, ChiefTech Electronics Ltd. of China. We received an aggregate of approximately 20%, 15% and 11% of our revenue from LG Electronics, ChiefTech and Samsung in 2007 and 28%, 10% and 11% in 2006, respectively. In addition, we sell to a number of contract manufacturers of Samsung. Total sales to Samsung and its contract manufacturers represented 25% and 20% of our net revenue for 2007 and 2006, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to be dependent on these customers for a significant portion of our revenue in the immediate future; however, we do not have long-term contractual purchase commitments from them, and we cannot assure you that they will continue to be our customers. We received an aggregate of approximately 81% of our revenues from our ten largest customers in 2007. Any action by one of our largest customers that affects our orders, product pricing or vendor status could significantly reduce our revenues and harm our financial results. In the future, our sales to our large customers will continue to be susceptible to quarterly fluctuation as our customers manage their inventories, principally for seasonal variations. In particular, our customers increase in inventory of our products in advance of the peak buying season during the second half of year for wireless handsets often leads to sequentially lower sales of our products in the first calendar quarter and, potentially, late in the fourth calendar quarter. Because our largest customers account for such a significant part of our business, the loss of, or a decline in sales to, any of our major customers would negatively impact our business. 19 Table of Contents Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our operating results to continue to fluctuate. Our revenues are difficult to predict and have varied significantly in the past from period to period. We expect our revenues and expense levels to continue to vary in the future, making it difficult to predict our future operating results. In particular, we experience seasonality and variability in demand for our products as our customers manage their inventories. Our customers tend to increase inventory of our products in anticipation of the peak fourth quarter buying season for the mobile consumer electronic devices in which our products are used, which often leads to sequentially lower sales of our products in the first calendar quarter and, potentially, late in the fourth calendar quarter. Additional factors that could cause our results to fluctuate include:  the forecasting, scheduling, rescheduling or cancellation of orders by our customers, particularly in China and other emerging markets;  costs associated with litigation, especially related to intellectual property;  liquidity and cash flow of our distributors and end-market customers;  changes in manufacturing costs, including wafer, test and assembly costs, and manufacturing yields, product quality and reliability;  the timing and availability of adequate manufacturing capacity from our manufacturing suppliers;  our ability to successfully define, design and release new products in a timely manner that meet our customers needs;  the timing, performance and pricing of new product introductions by us and by our competitors;  general economic conditions in the countries where we operate or our products are used;  changes in exchange rates, interest rates, tax rates and tax withholding;  geopolitical stability, especially affecting China, Taiwan and Asia in general; and  changes in domestic and international tax laws. Unfavorable changes in any of the above factors, most of which are beyond our control, could significantly harm our business and results of operations. We may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets. We operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence. Our competitiveness and future success depends on our ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. A fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could harm our competitive position within these markets. Our failure to anticipate these shifts, to develop new technologies or to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products, which could result in product obsolescence, decreased revenues and a loss of design wins to our competitors. The success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of long-term market demand and future technological developments, as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors, including:  effective marketing, sales and service;  timely and efficient completion of process design and device structure improvements and implementation of manufacturing, assembly and test processes; and  the quality, performance and reliability of the product. 20 Table of Contents If we fail to introduce new products or penetrate new markets, our revenues will likely decrease over time and our financial condition could suffer. Due to defects and failures that may occur, our products may not meet specifications, which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability claims. Our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality, performance and reliability that our products must meet. Integrated circuits, or ICs, as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments, which might require product replacement or recall. In addition, our customers may not use our products in a way that is consistent with our published specifications. If defects and failures occur in our products during the design phase or after, or our customers use our products in ways that are not consistent with their intended use, we could experience lost revenues, increased costs, including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support, delays in or cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments, or product returns or discounts, any of which would harm our operating results. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources, including any available insurance, to satisfy any asserted claims. The nature of the design process requires us to incur expenses prior to earning revenues associated with those expenses, and we will have difficulty selling our products if system designers do not design our products into their electronic systems. We devote significant time and resources in working with our customers system designers to understand their future needs and to provide products that we believe will meet those needs. If a customers system designer initially chooses a competitors product for a particular electronic system, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products for use in that electronic system because changing suppliers can involve significant cost, time, effort and risk for our customers. We often incur significant expenditures in the development of a new product without any assurance that our customers system designers will select our product for use in their electronic systems. We often are required to anticipate which product designs will generate demand in advance of our customers expressly indicating a need for that particular design. In some cases, there is minimal or no demand for our products in our anticipated target applications. Even if our products are selected by our customers system designers, a substantial period of time will elapse before we generate revenues related to the significant expenses we have incurred. The reasons for this delay generally include the following elements of our product sales and development cycle timeline and related influences:  our customers usually require a comprehensive technical evaluation of our products before they incorporate them into their electronic systems;  it can take up to 12 months from the time our products are selected to complete the design process;  it can take an additional nine to 12 months or longer to complete commercial introduction of the electronic systems that use our products, if they are introduced at all;  original equipment manufacturers typically limit the initial release of their electronic systems to evaluate performance and consumer demand; and  The development and commercial introduction of products incorporating new technology are frequently delayed. We estimate that the overall sales and development cycle timeline of an average product is approximately 16 months. Additionally, even if system designers use our products in their electronic systems, we cannot assure you that these systems will be commercially successful. As a result, we are unable to accurately forecast the volume and timing of our orders and revenues associated with any new product introductions. 21 Table of Contents Any increase in the manufacturing cost of our products could reduce our gross margins and operating profit. The semiconductor business exhibits ongoing competitive pricing pressure from customers and competitors. Accordingly, any increase in the cost of our products, whether by adverse purchase price variances or adverse manufacturing cost variances, will reduce our gross margins and operating profit. For example, if we do not incorporate the partially fabricated wafers held for us by our suppliers into our products in a timely fashion, we may still become obligated to purchase these materials, which may reduce our gross margins. We do not have many long-term supply agreements with our manufacturing suppliers and, consequently, we may not be able to obtain price reductions or anticipate or prevent future price increases from our suppliers. The average selling price of our products may decline, or a change in the mix of product orders may occur, either of which could reduce our gross margins. During a power management products life, its selling price tends to decrease for a particular application. As a result, to maintain gross margins on our products, we must continue to identify new applications for our products, reduce manufacturing costs for our existing products and introduce new products. If we are unable to identify new, high gross margin applications for our existing products, reduce our production costs or sell new, high gross margin products, our gross margins will suffer. A sustained reduction in our gross margins could harm our future operating results, cash flow and financial condition, which could lead to a significant drop in the price of our common stock. Because we receive a substantial portion of our revenues through distributors, their financial viability and ability to access the capital markets could impact our ability to continue to do business with them and could result in lower revenues, which could adversely affect our operating results and our customer relationships. We obtain a portion of our revenues through sales to distributors located in Asia who act as our fulfillment representatives. Sales to distributors accounted for 42%, 39% and 42% of our revenues for years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In the normal course of their operation as fulfillment representatives, these distributors typically perform functions such as order scheduling, shipment coordination, inventory stocking, payment and collections and, when applicable, currency exchange between purchasers of our products and these distributors. Our distributors compensation for these functions is reflected in the price of the products we sell to these distributors. Many of our current distributors also serve as our sales representatives procuring orders for us to fill directly. If these distributors are unable to pay us in a timely manner or if we anticipate that they will not pay us, we may elect to withhold future shipments, which could adversely affect our operating results. If one of our distributors experiences severe financial difficulties, becomes insolvent or declares bankruptcy, we could lose product inventory held by that distributor and we could be required to write off the value of any receivables owed to us by that distributor. We could also be required to record bad debt expense in excess of our reserves. We may not be successful in recognizing these indications or in finding replacement distributors in a timely manner, or at all, any of which could harm our operating results, cash flow and financial condition. Our distributor arrangements often require us to accept product returns and to provide price protection and if we fail to properly estimate our product returns and price protection reserves, this may adversely impact our reported financial information. A substantial portion of our sales are made through third-party distribution arrangements, which include stock rotation rights that generally permit the return of up to 5% of the previous six months purchases. We generally accept these returns in the second and fourth quarter of each annual period. Our arrangements with our distributors typically also include price protection provisions if we reduce our list prices. We record estimated returns at the time of shipment, and we record reserves for price protection at the time we decide to reduce our list prices. In the future, we could receive returns or claims that are in excess of our estimates and reserves, which could harm our operating results. 22 Table of Contents Our distributor arrangements often require us to accept returns of unsold products if contractual arrangements with a distributor are terminated, which could harm our operating results or, if we fail to take steps, could harm our relationship with these distributors and lead to a loss of revenues. If our relationship with any of our distributors deteriorates or terminates, it could lead to a temporary or permanent loss of revenues until a replacement sales channel can be established to service the affected end-user customers, as well as inventory write-offs or accounts receivable write-offs. We may not be successful in finding suitable alternative distributors and this could adversely affect our ability to sell in certain locations or to certain end-user customers. We also may be obligated to repurchase unsold products from a distributor if we decide to terminate our relationship with that distributor. Our current backlog may not be indicative of future sales. Due to the nature of our business, in which order lead times may vary, and the fact that customers are generally allowed to reschedule or cancel orders on short notice, we believe that our backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of our future sales. Our quarterly revenues also depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter. Because our lead times for the manufacturing of our products generally take six to ten weeks, we often must build in advance of orders. This exposes us to certain risks, most notably the possibility that expected sales will not occur, which may lead to excess inventory, and we may not be able to sell this inventory to other customers. In addition, we supply LG Electronics, one of our largest customers, through its central hub and we do not record backlog with respect to the products we ship to the hub. Therefore, our backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future sales. If consumer demand for mobile consumer electronic devices declines, our revenues will decrease. Our products are used primarily in the mobile consumer electronic devices market. For the foreseeable future, we expect to see the significant majority of our revenues continue to come from this market, especially in wireless handsets. If consumer demand for these products declines, our revenues will decrease. If we are unsuccessful in identifying alternative markets for our products in a timely manner, our operating results will suffer dramatically. Substantially all of our manufacturing suppliers, customers and operations are located in Asia, which subjects us to additional risks, including regional economic influences, logistical complexity, political instability and natural disasters including earthquakes. We conduct, and expect to continue to conduct, almost all of our business with companies that are located outside the United States. Based on ship-to locations, approximately 98%, 98% and 99% of our revenues came from customers in Asia, particularly South Korea, Taiwan, China and Japan, in years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A vast majority of our contract manufacturing operations are located in South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and China. In addition, we have a design center in Shanghai. As a result of our international focus, we face several challenges, including:  increased complexity and costs of managing international operations;  longer and more difficult collection of receivables;  political and economic instability;  limited protection of our intellectual property;  unanticipated changes in local regulations, including tax regulations;  timing and availability of import and export licenses; and  foreign currency exchange fluctuations relating to our international operating activities. Our corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California, our operations office in Chupei, Taiwan, and the production facilities of one of our wafer fabrication suppliers and several of our assembly and test suppliers in 23 Table of Contents Hsinchu and across Taiwan are located near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes. We do not maintain earthquake insurance and our business could be damaged in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster. In addition to risks in our operations from natural disasters, our customers are also subject to these risks. Any disaster impacting our customers could result in loss of orders, delay of business and temporary regional economic recessions. We are also more susceptible to the regional economic impact of health crises. Because we anticipate that we will continue to rely heavily on foreign companies or U.S. companies operating in Asia for our future growth, the above risks and issues that we do not currently anticipate could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and our results of operations. We outsource our wafer fabrication, testing, packaging, warehousing and shipping operations to third parties, and rely on these parties to produce and deliver our products according to requested demands in specification, quantity, cost and time. We rely on third parties for substantially all of our manufacturing operations, including wafer fabrication, wafer probe, wafer thinning, assembly, final test, warehousing and shipping. We depend on these parties to supply us with material of a requested quantity in a timely manner that meets our standards for yield, cost and manufacturing quality. Any problems with our manufacturing supply chain could adversely impact our ability to ship our products to our customers on time and in the quantity required, which in turn could cause an unanticipated decline in our sales and possibly damage our customer relationships. Our products are manufactured at a limited number of locations. If we experience manufacturing problems at a particular location, we would be required to transfer manufacturing to a backup supplier. Converting or transferring manufacturing from a primary supplier to a backup fabrication facility could be expensive and could take as long as six to 12 months. During such a transition, we would be required to meet customer demand from our then-existing inventory, as well as any partially finished goods that can be modified to the required product specifications. We do not seek to maintain sufficient inventory to address a lengthy transition period because we believe it is uneconomical to keep more than minimal inventory on hand. As a result, we may not be able to meet customer needs during such a transition, which could delay shipments, cause a production delay or stoppage for our customers, result in a decline in our sales and damage our customer relationships. In addition, a significant portion of our sales is to customers that practice just-in-time order management from their suppliers, which gives us a very limited amount of time in which to process and complete these orders. As a result, delays in our production or shipping by the parties to whom we outsource these functions could reduce our sales, damage our customer relationships and damage our reputation in the marketplace, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. The loss of any of our key personnel could seriously harm our business, and our failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management talent could impair our ability to grow our business. The loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could seriously harm our business. In particular, our ability to define and design new products, gain new customers and grow our business depends on the continued contributions of Richard K. Williams, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer, as well as our senior level sales, finance, operations, technology and engineering personnel. Our future growth will also depend significantly on our ability to recruit and retain qualified and talented managers and engineers, along with key manufacturing, quality, sales and marketing staff members. There remains intense competition for these individuals in our industry, especially those with power and analog semiconductor design and applications expertise. We cannot assure you we will be successful in finding, hiring and retaining these individuals. If we are unable to recruit and retain such talent, our product and technology development, manufacturing, marketing and sales efforts could be impaired. 24 Table of Contents We do not expect to sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage any future growth effectively. We have experienced significant growth in a short period of time. Our revenues have increased from approximately $1.0 million in 2001 to $110 million in 2007. We do not expect to achieve similar growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance. If we are unable to maintain adequate revenue growth, our financial results could suffer and our stock price could decline. We have also grown from 110 employees on January 1, 2004 to 295 employees on December 31, 2007, with many located in regional and international offices. Our international growth may subject us to income and transaction taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign locations. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our U.S. and foreign tax estimates and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. If additional taxes are assessed against us, our operating results or financial condition could be materially affected. Our expansion has placed a significant strain on our management, personnel, systems and resources. Any future expansion is likely to result in additional strain on our managerial infrastructure. To manage our growth successfully and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we believe we must effectively:  recruit, hire, train and manage additional qualified engineers for our research and development activities, especially in the positions of design engineering, product and test engineering, and applications engineering;  continue to implement and improve adequate administrative, financial and operational systems, procedures and controls; and  enhance our information technology support for enterprise resource planning and design engineering by adapting and expanding our systems and tool capabilities, and properly training new hires as to their use. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new products, our introduction of derivative products may be delayed and we may fail to satisfy customer requirements, maintain product quality, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures. A failure to maintain our international structure may adversely affect our tax rate, financial condition and operating results. During 2005, we realigned certain areas of our operations in connection with the implementation of an international structure. This realignment required us to transfer certain functions previously handled in our Santa Clara, California headquarters to offices in foreign jurisdictions, primarily Macau. If we fail to maintain our realigned operations, our operating results may be adversely affected. Additionally, our international structure results in an increased volume of transactions and accounting for those transactions may require us to increase our headcount either domestically or internationally. A failure to process those transactions in an accurate and timely manner could be indicative of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. Our international structure requires that we understand complex tax laws and regulations in various domestic and international jurisdictions. If we are unable to comply with domestic and international tax laws, our tax rate and our financial condition may be adversely impacted. Further, the domestic and international tax laws governing our structure are subject to change, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. 25 Table of Contents We compete against companies with substantially greater financial and other resources, and our market share or gross margins may be reduced if we are unable to respond to competitive challenges effectively. The analog, mixed-signal, or analog with digital, and power management semiconductor industry in which we operate is highly competitive and dynamic, and we expect it to remain so. Our ability to compete effectively depends on defining, designing and regularly introducing new products that meet or anticipate the power management needs of our customers next-generation products and applications. We compete with numerous domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources with which to pursue marketing, technology development, product design, manufacturing, quality, sales and distribution of their products. We consider our primary competitors to be Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., Linear Technology Corporation, Texas Instruments Incorporated, Semtech Corporation and National Semiconductor Corporation. We expect continued competition from existing suppliers as well as from new entrants into the power management semiconductor market. Our ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including:  our success in identifying new and emerging markets, applications and technologies, and developing power management solutions for these markets;  our products performance and cost effectiveness relative to that of our competitors products;  our ability to deliver products in large volume on a timely basis at a competitive price;  our success in utilizing new and proprietary technologies to offer products and features previously not available in the marketplace;  our ability to recruit application engineers and designers; and  our ability to protect our intellectual property. We cannot assure you that our products will compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by our existing competitors or new companies entering this market. Assertions by third parties of infringement by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs, reduce sales of our products and cause our operating results to suffer. The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We have in the past received, and expect that in the future we may receive, communications from various industry participants alleging our infringement of their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights. Any lawsuits resulting from such allegations could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:  stop selling products or using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property;  incur significant legal expenses;  pay damages to the party claiming infringement;  redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property; and  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We initiated a lawsuit against Linear Technology Corporation in February 2006 for unfair business practices, interference with existing and prospective customers and trade libel, as well as a declaration of patent 26 Table of Contents invalidity and non-infringement. In this case, we are seeking to prevent Linear Technology from continuing a marketing campaign designed to disrupt our business relationships and sales by suggesting to our customers that our products infringe several U.S. patents owned by Linear Technology. As we informed Linear Technology in 2003 and 2004, and as discussed in our prior public filings, we believe that none of our products infringe the patents in question. However, whether or not we prevail in this lawsuit, we expect to incur significant legal expenses related to this case. In February 2006, in a related action, Linear Technology petitioned the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) requesting that the USITC initiate an investigation to determine if certain of our products infringe certain patents owned by Linear Technology under Section 337 of the Tariff Act. The patents involved in this action are a subset of the patents involved in the lawsuit that we filed against Linear Technology. The accused products include charge pumps and switching regulators and are similar to the products involved in our lawsuit with Linear Technology. In a Final Determination issued September 22, 2007, the USITC left unchanged its earlier initial determination that our charge pumps do not violate Section 337 of the Tariff Act because they do not infringe any valid claim of U.S. Patent No. 6,411,531 (531 Patent) owned by Linear Technology. The Final Determination also found that a majority of our switching regulator designs do not infringe Linears Patent No. 6,580,258 (258 Patent). The USITC also found that one family of switching regulator products infringes certain claims of the 258 Patent. Following normal USITC procedure, the USITC issued a limited exclusion order under Section 337 of the Tariff Act prohibiting the direct importation by us of this particular product family. This exclusion order does not, however, prevent our customers from importing their products into the United States. Linear Technologys request that downstream products be barred from importation was denied. Recently, Linear Technology served notice that it will be appealing portions of the Final Determination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On February 20, 2008, Linear Technology filed a complaint with the USITC seeking an enforcement proceeding to correct alleged violations of the limited exclusion order of September 22, 2007. We intend to oppose both of these actions and to appeal portions of the Final Determination that were unfavorable to us. We believe that none of our products infringe the Linear Technology patents in question. However, whether or not we prevail in this appeal, we expect to incur significant legal expenses. Uncertainty over the outcome of our litigation with Linear Technology may cause our customers or potential customers to elect not to include our products that are the subject of this litigation into the design of their systems. Once a customers system designer initially chooses a competitors product for a particular electronic system, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products for use in that electronic system, because changing suppliers can involve significant cost, time, effort and risk for our customers. As a result, our litigation with Linear Technology or any similar future litigation may reduce both our current and future revenues. If we are unsuccessful in this case, our business and our ability to compete in foreign markets could be harmed, and we could be enjoined from selling the accused products in the United States, either directly or indirectly, which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights adequately could impair our ability to compete effectively or to defend ourselves from litigation, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technologies and know-how. While we have more than 50 patents issued or allowed in the United States or foreign countries and a larger number of pending applications, the rights granted to us may not be meaningful or provide us with any commercial advantage. For example, these patents could be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or be declared invalid or unenforceable in 27 Table of Contents judicial or administrative proceedings. The failure of our patents to adequately protect our technology might make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products or technologies. Our foreign patent protection is generally not as comprehensive as our U.S. patent protection and may not protect our intellectual property in some countries where our products are sold or may be sold in the future. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. Many U.S.-based companies have encountered substantial intellectual property infringement in foreign countries, including countries where we sell products. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. It is possible that unauthorized use of our intellectual property may occur without our knowledge. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could reduce the value of our technology in licensing arrangements or in cross-licensing negotiations, and could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could harm our business, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us. Any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business, result in integration difficulties or fail to realize anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. We may choose to acquire companies, technologies, assets and personnel that are complementary to our business, including for the purpose of expanding our new product design capacity, introducing new design, market or application skills or enhancing and expanding our existing product lines. In October 2006, we acquired Analog Power Semiconductor Corporation and related assets and personnel, primarily located in Shanghai, China. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:  difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;  diversion of managements attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions;  difficulties in entering markets in which we may have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors may have stronger market positions;  the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, suppliers and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans;  improving and expanding our management information systems to accommodate expanded operations;  insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; and  addressing unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses. Acquisitions may also cause us to:  issue capital stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership;  use a substantial portion of our cash resources or incur debt;  assume liabilities;  record goodwill or incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; and  incur large and immediate write-offs and other related expenses. Any of these factors could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and our failure to realize these benefits could adversely affect our business. In addition, we may not be successful in identifying future acquisition opportunities or in consummating any acquisitions that we may pursue on favorable 28 Table of Contents terms, if at all. Any transactions that we complete may impair stockholder value or otherwise adversely affect our business and the market price of our stock. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our financial condition and operating results. Our operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted by worldwide political and economic uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we address, including the cyclical nature of and volatility in the semiconductor industry. The semiconductor industry has historically exhibited cyclical behavior which at various times has included significant downturns in customer demand. These conditions have caused significant variations in product orders and production capacity utilization, as well as price erosion. Because a significant portion of our expenses is fixed in the near term or is incurred in advance of anticipated sales, we may not be able to decrease our expenses rapidly enough to offset any unanticipated shortfall in revenues. If this situation were to occur, it could adversely affect our operating results, cash flow and financial condition. Additionally, general worldwide economic conditions have recently experienced a downturn due to slower economic activity, concerns about inflation and deflation, increased energy costs, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the wired and wireless communications markets, recent international conflicts and terrorist and military activity, and the impact of natural disasters and public health emergencies. These conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and they could cause U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products and services, which would delay and lengthen sales cycles. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, worldwide, or in the semiconductor industry. If the economy or markets in which we operate do not continue at their present levels, our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected. Our business may be adversely impacted if our end customers cannot obtain sufficient supplies of other components in their products to meet their production projections and target quantities. Our power management products are used by our customers in conjunction with a number of other components such as digital integrated circuits, baseband processors, microcontrollers and digital signal processors. If for any reason our customers incur a shortage of any component, their ability to produce the forecasted quantity of their end product or model may be adversely affected and our product sales would decline until such shortage is remedied. Such a situation could harm our operating results, cash flow and financial condition. A failure of our information systems would adversely impact our ability to process orders for and manufacture products. We operate a multinational business enterprise with manufacturing, administration and sales groups located in Asia, Europe and the United States. These disparate groups are connected by a virtual private network-based enterprise resource planning system, where daily manufacturing operations and order entry functions rely on maintaining a reliable network among locations. Any failure of our computer network or our enterprise resource planning system would impede our ability to schedule orders, monitor production work in process and ship and bill our finished goods to our customers. Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, 29 Table of Contents regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. Further, as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment commitments made by us, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet such commitments could adversely impact our effective tax rate. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. The requirement that we expense employee stock options has significantly reduced our net income and will continue to do so in future periods. We adopted SFAS No.123(R) effective January 1, 2006, which requires the measurement of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations. As a result of adopting SFAS No.123(R), we now have additional stock-based compensation expense associated with grants after April 4, 2005, the date of our initial filing of our registration statement in connection with our initial public offering, based on the grant date fair value. The ultimate amount of future stock-based compensation expense will depend upon the number of grants, the estimated grant date fair value, which depends upon significant assumptions including stock volatility and estimated term, the assumed forfeiture rate and the requisite service period for future grants. This expense has had a significant impact on our results of operations since 2006. We have recorded approximately $6.9 million and $6.1 million of stock-based compensation expense under SFAS No.123(R) for years 2007 and 2006, respectively. We believe that this will continue to have a significant impact on our future operating results. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
