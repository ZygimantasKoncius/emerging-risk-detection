(2) Reflects the results of operations of our Cancún airport and two Cancún airport services subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. (3) Reflects revenues under intercompany agreements (other than the solidarity agreement) which are eliminated in the consolidation adjustment. (4) Reflects the results of operations of our airports located in Veracruz, Minatitlán, Oaxaca, Huatulco, Tapachula and Cozumel. (5) Reflects the results of operations of our parent holding company and our services subsidiaries. Because none of these entities hold the concessions for our airports, we do not report workload unit data for these entities. (6) The consolidation adjustment affects our consolidated net income by eliminating both revenues and expenses from intercompany transactions from all segments. The consolidation adjustment does not affect net income. We and our subsidiaries have entered into intercompany agreements that affect the revenues, operating costs and income at our individual subsidiaries but not on a consolidated 103 Table of Contents basis. Under the intercompany agreements, our holding company Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, S.A.B. de C.V., or GAS, and our administrative services companies provide certain services and guarantees to the airport operating subsidiaries (which may include payments to certain of our airport operating subsidiaries), in exchange for which the airport operating subsidiaries make payments to GAS and the service companies. One of these agreements is the Solidarity Agreement, pursuant to which each of our subsidiaries pays a fee to our parent company, in exchange for which the parent company guarantees the ongoing viability of that subsidiarys concession, including, in the case of certain subsidiaries, by making payments to those subsidiaries to ensure that they have the resources to comply with their master development plans and other regulatory obligations. The intercompany agreements also include agreements to provide other routine services, including negotiating regulated tariffs and interfacing with regulators, leasing of commercial real estate, trademark license royalties, marketing services and employee costs. The costs of these services and guarantees, including the Solidarity Agreement, are actual costs that are charged to individual airports. In the presentation of our consolidated results, the revenues and expenses generated by these transactions are eliminated because they are intercompany transactions. 104 Table of Contents Summary Historical Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated.

The concession fee is currently 5.0% of each concession holders gross annual regulated revenues from the use of public domain assets pursuant to the terms of its concession. This fee is described in Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsOperating Costs Technical Assistance Fee and Government Concession Fee.

Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 Revenues Total consolidated revenues for 2014 were Ps.5,879.2 million, 8.0% higher than the Ps. 5,446.1 million recorded in 2013. The increase in total revenues resulted from increases in aeronautical revenues of 7.9% and increases in non-aeronautical revenues of 11.0%, primarily resulting from a 9.9% increase in passenger traffic. Total revenues per workload unit decreased 1.4% from Ps.251.5 in 2013 to Ps.248.1 in 2014 due mainly to the 9.7% decrease in revenues 105 Table of Contents from construction services per workload unit, which are based on capital improvements to concessioned assets and are not directly related to passenger traffic, and therefore workload units, in a given year. Our consolidated revenues from aeronautical services, net of rebates, increased 7.9% to Ps.3,319.7 million in 2014 from Ps.3,076.7 million in 2013, due primarily to a 9.9% increase in passenger traffic. Revenues from passenger charges increased 9.4% to Ps.2,659.5 million in 2014 (80.1% of our aeronautical revenues during the period) from Ps.2,429.9 million in 2013 (79.0% of our aeronautical revenues during the period), reflecting the increase in passenger traffic and the annual increase in our regulated rates. Aeronautical revenues per workload unit decreased 1.4% from Ps.142.1 in 2013 to Ps.140.1 in 2014. Revenues from non-aeronautical services increased 11.0% to Ps.1,979.7 million in 2014 from Ps.1,782.8 million in 2013. The primary factors influencing the change in non-aeronautical revenue from 2013 to 2014 were an increase in commercial revenues because of higher passenger traffic during 2014 and improved contractual terms for certain commercial agreements in place. These factors led to a 9.8% increase in revenues from retail stores, a 4.0% increase in revenues from duty-free shops, and a 24.3% increase in other income, which consisted principally of revenue from tourism services and hotel reservation providers. Increases of 16.6% of revenues from car rental companies, 19.6% in revenues from banking and currency exchange services, 20.0% in revenues from food and beverages, 3.3% in advertising revenues, 20.7% in parking lot revenues, 15.1% in revenues from ground transportation and 5.0% in teleservices revenues also contributed to the increase in revenues from non-aeronautical services. Non-aeronautical revenue per workload unit increased 1.5%, from Ps.82.3 per workload unit in 2013 to Ps.83.5 per workload unit in 2014. Revenues from construction services decreased 1.2% to Ps.579.8 million in 2014 from Ps.586.6 million in 2013 because of a lower level of capital expenditures carried out at our Mexican airports. Our revenues from regulated sources in 2014 were Ps.3,487.4 million, a 8.0% increase compared to Ps.3,229.4 million in 2013, mainly due to the increase in total passenger traffic and the annual increase in our regulated rates. During 2014, Ps.1,812.0 million of our revenues was derived from non-regulated sources, a 11.2% increase from the Ps.1,630.1 million of revenues derived from non-regulated sources in 2013. This increase was primarily due to the 11.3% increase in commercial revenues described above, from Ps.1,566.6 million in 2013 to Ps.1,743.6 million in 2014. Revenues by Airport Aeronautical revenues increased by 5.4% from Ps.2,331.9 million in 2013 to Ps.2,456.7 million in 2014 at the Cancún Airport, mainly due to the increase of 9.4% in passenger traffic at that airport. Non-aeronautical revenues increased at Cancún Airport by 10.4% from Ps.1,594.6 million in 2013 to Ps.1,761.2 million in 2014, due principally to the increase in passenger traffic in 2014 and the increase in retail stores. Construction services revenues at the Cancún Airport decreased to Ps.236.5 million in 2014 from Ps.241.6 million in 2013. Total revenues increased by 6.9% from Ps.4,168.1 million in 2013 to Ps.4,454.4 million in 2014 at the Cancún Airport, 106 Table of Contents largely due to the increase in passenger traffic and improved contractual terms for certain commercial agreements in place. Revenues per workload unit at the Cancún Airport decreased by 1.6% from Ps.255.7 in 2013 to Ps.251.7 in 2014, primarily because of the 2.1% decrease in revenues from construction services, as mentioned above. Aeronautical revenues increased by 17.0% from Ps.192.7 million in 2013 to Ps.225.4 million in 2014 at the Mérida Airport, due to a 9.2% increase in passenger traffic at that airport. Non-aeronautical revenues increased at Mérida Airport by 7.0% from Ps.58.7 million in 2013 to Ps.62.8 million in 2014, due principally to the increase of 8.3% in commercial revenues because of increased passenger traffic. Revenues overall increased by 24.3% from Ps.253.0 million in 2013 to Ps.314.5 million in 2014 at the Mérida Airport, due to a significant increase in revenues from construction services from 2013 to 2014. Revenues per workload unit at the Mérida Airport increased by 16.5% from Ps.168.7 in 2013 to Ps.196.6 in 2014, principally due to the increase in construction services revenues. Aeronautical revenues increased by 14.6% from Ps.127.1 million in 2013 to Ps.145.7 million in 2014 at the Villahermosa Airport, due to the increase of 10.5% in passenger traffic at that airport. Non-aeronautical revenues increased at Villahermosa Airport by 27.6% from Ps.39.5 million in 2013 to Ps.50.4 million in 2014, due principally to the increase of 36.4% in commercial revenues. Construction services revenues increased from Ps.9.8 million in 2013 to Ps.30.2 million in 2014. Revenues increased by 28.3% from Ps.176.4 million in 2013 to Ps.226.3 million in 2014 at the Villahermosa Airport, largely due to an increase in construction services. Revenues per workload unit at the Villahermosa Airport increased by 17.7% from Ps.160.3 in 2013 to Ps.188.6 in 2014 primarily due to an increase in construction services revenues. Aeronautical revenues at our other six airports increased by 15.7% from Ps.425.1 million in 2013 to Ps.491.9 million in 2014, due to the increase of 12.8% in passenger traffic at those airports. Non-aeronautical revenues increased by 17.1% from Ps.90.0 million in 2013 to Ps.105.3 million in 2014, due to new retail outlets opening in, and an increase in passenger traffic at, the Veracruz, Oaxaca, Huatulco, Cozumel, Tapachula and Minatitlán airports. Construction services revenues decreased to Ps.286.8 million in 2014 from Ps.333.7 million in 2013. Revenues increased by 4.1% from Ps.848.8 million in 2013 to Ps.884.0 million in 2014 at the other six airports, due to the increases in revenues from aeronautical services and non-aeronautical services. Revenues per workload unit at our other six airports decreased by 10.5% from Ps.308.7 in 2013 to Ps.276.2 million in 2014 principally due to the decrease in revenues from construction services and the solidarity agreement. Revenues from our parent holding company and our administrative services companies increased by 2.2% from Ps.874.6 million in 2013 to Ps.894.1 million in 2014, due to the increase in payments by our operating subsidiaries under intercompany agreements related to administrative services. These revenues are intercompany and are therefore eliminated in consolidation. 107 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were Ps.2,718.2 million in 2014, a 5.6% increase from the Ps.2,574.9 million recorded in 2013, primarily as a result of a 8.7% increase in cost of services, a 9.9% increase in technical assistance fees, a 8.5% increase in government concession fees and a 8.6% increase in depreciation and amortization. The increase in total operating expenses was partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in the cost of construction and a 4.7% decrease in general and administrative expenses. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses represented 46.2% of total revenues in 2014 as compared to 47.3% of total revenues in 2013. Operating costs per workload unit decreased 3.5%, from Ps.118.9 per workload unit in 2013 to Ps.114.7 per workload unit in 2014, primarily because of the economies of scale we enjoy in our operating expenses. Cost of services increased 8.7% to Ps.1,081.4 million in 2014 from Ps.995.2 million in 2013. The increase was principally due to higher energy costs, security and maintenance costs, and professional fees. Our cost of services per workload unit decreased 0.9% from Ps.46.0 in 2013 to Ps.45.5 in 2014 because of the 9.5% increase in workload units and because many of our service costs (such as energy and security) are not directly correlated with the number of workload units. General and administrative expenses decreased 4.7% to Ps.170.2 million in 2014 from Ps.178.6 million in 2013. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower professional fees paid to third parties and lower travel expenses in connection with the bidding process for the LMM Airport in 2013. Technical assistance fees increased by 9.9% to Ps.190.4 million in 2014 from Ps.173.3 million in 2013, and government concession fees increased by 8.5% to Ps.242.2 million in 2014 from Ps.223.1 million in 2013. The technical assistance fees increased in 2014 due to the corresponding increase in our consolidated earnings before comprehensive financing costs, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, which is the basis used to determine the technical assistance fee. The increase in government concession fees was primarily the result of an increase in regulated revenues, which is the basis for the calculation of the concession fee. Construction costs were Ps.579.8 million in 2014 and Ps.586.6 million in 2013. Because we hired a third party to provide all of our construction and upgrade services, our revenues relating to construction or upgrade services are equal to our expenses for those services. Depreciation and amortization costs increased by 8.6% to Ps.454.3 million in 2014 from Ps.418.3 million in 2013. This increase was principally due to the depreciation of new investments in fixed assets and improvements made to concessioned assets. Operating Expenses by Airport Operating expenses for Cancún Airport were Ps.2,058.4 million in 2014, a 1.2% decrease from the Ps.2,083.5 million recorded in 2013, primarily as a result of decreases in professional fees, construction costs and solidarity agreement expenses. Operating expenses per workload unit for Cancún Airport were Ps.116.3 in 2014, a 9.0% decrease from the Ps.127.8 recorded in 2013. 108 Table of Contents Operating expenses for Mérida Airport were Ps.212.4 million in 2014, a 17.0% increase from the Ps. 181.4 million recorded in 2013, principally as a result of an increase in construction costs. Operating expenses per workload unit for Mérida Airport were Ps.132.7 in 2014, a 9.8% increase from the Ps.120.9 recorded in 2013. Operating expenses for Villahermosa Airport were Ps.145.0 million in 2014, a 15.6% increase from the Ps.125.4 million recorded in 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in construction costs. Operating expenses per workload unit for Villahermosa Airport were Ps.120.8 in 2014, a 6.0% increase from the Ps.114.0 recorded in 2013. Operating expenses for our six other airports were Ps.708.3 million in 2014, a 4.0% decrease from the Ps.737.9 million recorded in 2013, principally as a result of a decrease in construction costs and a decrease in expenses related to our solidarity agreement. Operating expenses per workload unit for our other six airports were Ps.221.3 in 2014, a 17.5% decrease from the Ps.268.4 recorded in 2013. Operating expenses for our parent holding company and our administrative services companies were Ps.803.2 million in 2014, a 7.7% decrease from the Ps.870.0 million recorded in 2013, principally due to the decrease in solidarity agreement expenses. The expenses from our solidarity agreement are intercompany and are therefore eliminated in consolidation. Operating Income Operating income increased 10.1% to Ps.3,161.0 million in 2014 from Ps.2,871.1 million in 2013. This increase in operating income was primarily a result of the 7.9% increase in aeronautical revenues and 11.0% increase in non-aeronautical revenues due to higher passenger traffic and an increase in commercial revenues due to improved terms of commercial agreements. Operating Income by Airport Operating income for Cancún Airport increased by 14.9% to Ps.2,396.0 million in 2014 from Ps.2,084.5 million in 2013, primarily because of the 5.4% increase in aeronautical revenues and 10.4% increase in non-aeronautical revenues due to higher passenger traffic. Operating income per workload unit at Cancún Airport increased 5.9% from Ps.127.9 in 2013 to Ps.135.4 in 2014. Operating income for Mérida Airport increased by 42.7% to Ps.102.1 million in 2014 from Ps.71.6 million in 2013 mainly because of the increase in revenues from construction services. Operating income per workload unit at Mérida Airport increased 33.7% from Ps.47.8 in 2013 to Ps.63.9 in 2014. Operating income for Villahermosa Airport increased by 59.4% to Ps.81.3 million in 2014 from Ps.51.0 million in 2013 primarily because of the increase in revenues from construction services and the 23.8% decrease in solidarity agreement expenses. Operating income per workload unit at Villahermosa Airport increased 46.2% from Ps.46.3 in 2013 to Ps.67.7 in 2014. 109 Table of Contents Operating income for our six other airports decreased by 5.3% to Ps.257.2 million in 2014 from Ps.271.4 million in 2013 principally because of the 15.7% increase in aeronautical revenues and the 17.1% increase in non-aeronautical revenues due to higher passenger traffic. Operating income per workload unit at the other six airports decreased 18.6% from Ps.98.8 in 2013 to Ps.80.4 in 2014. Operating income for our parent holding company and our administrative services companies decreased by 17.4% to Ps.324.3 million in 2014 from Ps.392.8 million in 2013 primarily because of the decrease in payments by our operating subsidiaries under intercompany agreements. Comprehensive Financing Result Our net comprehensive financing result was a loss of Ps.115.0 million in 2014 as compared to income of Ps.18.6 million in 2013, primarily due to a decrease in interest income of 33.8%, from Ps.59.8 million in 2013 to Ps.39.6 million in 2014, and an increase in the exchange rate loss, from Ps.41.1 million in 2013 to Ps.154.5 million in 2014. The increase in exchange rate loss is due to the 12.7% depreciation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during the period, which resulted in an increase in the peso value of our U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Taxes In 2014, our current income tax provision increased 14.7%, from Ps.736.2 million in 2013 to Ps.844.1 million in 2014 primarily due to higher net income before taxes caused by certain of our subsidiaries, including the Cancún Airport and the Veracruz Airport. This increase in the current tax provision was partially offset by the net favorable impact related to the Cancún Airports participation in the tax amnesty program. While we paid Ps.128.3 million to settle our tax dispute related to the tax amortization period of our airport concession, we also amended our tax returns for 2012 and 2011 to reflect the revised amortization period. This resulted in a favorable impact of Ps.152.5 million. Our deferred income tax provision changed from an expense of Ps.94.3 million in 2013 to a deferred income tax gain of Ps.52.2 million in 2014, due to the participation of our Cancún Airport subsidiary in the tax amnesty program. We adjusted the remaining tax basis of our Cancún Airport concession, which resulted in a tax benefit of Ps.175.5 million in 2013, primarily due to the impact of the Mexican federal tax reform. As a result of the change in income tax rates for 2014 and beyond, we readjusted our deferred tax balances to the higher tax rate, resulting in a charge of Ps.122.7 million in 2013 and further, due to the repeal of the IETU, we recorded deferred taxes on an income tax basis for certain subsidiaries which had been subject to the IETU, resulting in an additional charge of Ps.161.1 million. Our current IETU tax provision was eliminated in 2014, because of the repeal of the IETU on January 1, 2014. Our deferred IETU tax provision was eliminated in 2014 due to the cancellation of the remaining net deferred IETU tax liability as of December 31, 2013, resulting from the repeal of the IETU. 110 Table of Contents Our asset tax provision in 2014 was Ps.6.8 million and 2013 was Ps.11.5 million. The Company submitted a request to the Mexican Ministry of Finance to receive an opinion on whether we can retain the right to recover part of the asset tax that was paid in prior years. As of April 2010, the Ministry of Finance had refused to issue such an opinion to us. We are currently appealing this decision in Mexican federal court. Our overall effective tax rate in 2014 increased from to 16.4% to 25.9%, primarily as a result of the changes in Mexican tax law discussed above and the impact of the Cancún Airports participation in the tax amnesty program. Net Income Net income decreased 0.6% to Ps.2,283.7 million in 2014 from Ps.2,296.9 million in 2013. This was mainly the result of the 14.7% increase in income taxes and the 8.7% increase in the cost of services, which offset the 10.1% increase in operating income. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 Revenues Total consolidated revenues for 2013 were Ps.5,446.1 million, 6.4% higher than the Ps.5,119.9 million recorded in 2012. The increase in total revenues resulted from increases in aeronautical revenues of 8.0% and increases in non-aeronautical revenues of 10.9%, primarily resulting from a 10.1% increase in passenger traffic. Total revenues per workload unit decreased 2.7% from Ps.258.6 in 2012 to Ps.251.5 in 2013 due mainly to the 11.5% decrease in revenues from construction services, which are based on capital improvements to concessioned assets and are not directly related to passenger traffic, and therefore workload units, in a given year. Our consolidated revenues from aeronautical services, net of rebates, increased 8.0% to Ps.3,076.7 million in 2013 from Ps.2,849.1 million in 2012, due primarily to a 10.0% increase in passenger traffic. Revenues from passenger charges increased 6.5% to Ps. 2,429.9 million in 2013 (79.0% of our aeronautical revenues during the period) from Ps.2,280.9 million in 2012 (80.1% of our aeronautical revenues during the period), reflecting the increase in passenger traffic and the annual increase in our regulated rates. Aeronautical revenues per workload unit decreased 1.0% from Ps.143.9 in 2012 to Ps.142.4 in 2013. Revenues from non-aeronautical services increased 10.9% to Ps. 1,782.8 million in 2013 from Ps.1,607.5 million in 2012. The primary factors influencing the change in non-aeronautical revenue from 2012 to 2013 were an increase in commercial revenues because of improved contractual terms for certain commercial agreements in place and higher passenger traffic during 2013. These factors led to a 10.1% increase in revenues from retail stores, a 10.3% increase in revenues from duty-free shops, and a 13.0% increase in other income, which consisted principally of revenue from tourism services and hotel reservation providers. Increases of 8.6% of revenues from car rental companies, 10.6% in revenues from banking and currency exchange services, 12.0% in revenues from food and beverages, 13.6% in advertising revenues, 4.3% in parking lot revenues, 20.7% in revenues from ground transportation and 27.7% in teleservices 111 Table of Contents revenues also contributed to the increase in revenues from non-aeronautical services. Non-aeronautical revenue per workload unit increased 1.4%, from Ps.81.2 per workload unit in 2012 to Ps.82.3 per workload unit in 2013. Revenues from construction services decreased 11.6% to Ps.586.6 million in 2013 from Ps.663.2 million in 2012 because of a lower level of capital expenditures carried out at our Mexican airports. Our revenues from regulated sources in 2013 were Ps.3,229.4 million, a 8.2% increase compared to Ps.2,983.4 million in 2012, mainly due to the increase in total passenger traffic and the annual increase in our regulated rates. During 2013, Ps.1,630.1 million of our revenues was derived from non-regulated sources, a 10.6% increase from the Ps.1,473.3 million of revenues derived from non-regulated sources in 2012. This increase was primarily due to the 10.7% increase in commercial revenues described above, from Ps.1,414.6 million in 2012 to Ps.1,566.6 million in 2013. Revenues by Airport Aeronautical revenues increased by 8.9% from Ps.2,141.4 million in 2012 to Ps.2,331.9 million in 2013 at the Cancún Airport, mainly due to the increase of 10.4% in passenger traffic at that airport. Non-aeronautical revenues increased at Cancún Airport by 11.1% from Ps.1,434.9 million in 2012 to Ps.1,594.6 million in 2013, due principally to the increase in commercial revenues because of improved contractual terms for certain commercial agreements in place. Construction services revenues at the Cancún Airport decreased to Ps. 241.6 million in 2013 from Ps.351.4 million in 2012. Total revenues increased by 6.1% from Ps.3,927.7 million in 2012 to Ps.4,168.1 million in 2013 at the Cancún Airport, largely due to the increase in passenger traffic and improved contractual terms for certain commercial agreements in place. Revenues per workload unit at the Cancún Airport decreased by 3.7% from Ps.265.4 in 2012 to Ps.255.7 in 2013, primarily because of the 31.2% decrease in revenues from construction services, as mentioned above. Aeronautical revenues increased by 4.4% from Ps.184.5 million in 2012 to Ps.192.7 million in 2013 at the Mérida Airport, due to a 6.7% increase in passenger traffic at that airport. Non-aeronautical revenues increased at Mérida Airport by 10.1% from Ps.53.3 million in 2012 to Ps.58.7 million in 2013, due principally to the increase of 11.8% in commercial revenues. Revenues overall decreased by 5.9% from Ps.268.9 million in 2012 to Ps.253.0 million in 2013 at the Mérida Airport, due to a 94.9% decrease in revenues from construction services. Revenues per workload unit at the Mérida Airport decreased by 12.2% from Ps.192.1 in 2012 to Ps.168.7 in 2013, principally due to the decrease in construction services revenues. Aeronautical revenues increased by 3.8% from Ps.122.4 million in 2012 to Ps.127.1 million in 2013 at the Villahermosa Airport, due to the increase of 6.7% in passenger traffic at that airport. Non-aeronautical revenues increased at Villahermosa Airport by 7.6% from Ps.36.7 million in 2012 to Ps.39.5 million in 2013, due principally to the increase of 9.8% in commercial revenues. Construction services revenues decreased from Ps.37.9 million in 2012 to Ps.9.8 million in 2013. Revenues decreased by 10.5% from Ps.197.0 million in 2012 to Ps.176.4 million in 2013 at the Villahermosa Airport, largely due to a decrease in construction services. 112 Table of Contents Revenues per workload unit at the Villahermosa Airport decreased by 18.6% from Ps.197.0 in 2012 to Ps.160.3 in 2013 primarily due to a decrease in construction services revenues. Aeronautical revenues at our other six airports increased by 6.1% from Ps.400.8 million in 2012 to Ps.425.1 million in 2013, due to the increase of 7.6% in passenger traffic at those airports. Non-aeronautical revenues increased by 8.6% from Ps.82.9 million in 2012 to Ps.90.0 million in 2013, due to new retail outlets opening in Veracruz and an increase in passenger traffic at Veracruz and Minatitlán airports. Construction services revenues increased to Ps.333.7 million in 2013 from Ps.242.8 million in 2012, due to the expansion of a platform in the Veracruz Airport and the rehabilitation of roads and runway repairs in several airports. Revenues increased by 16.9% from Ps.726.3 million in 2012 to Ps.848.8 million in 2013 at the other six airports, due to the increase in revenues from construction services as well as an increase of Ps.53.5 million in revenues from our solidarity agreement. The revenues from our solidarity agreement are intercompany revenues and are therefore eliminated in consolidation. Revenues per workload unit at our other six airports increased by 19.0% from Ps.308.6 in 2012 to Ps.367.1 million in 2013 principally due to the increase in revenues from construction services and the solidarity agreement. Revenues from our parent holding company and our administrative services companies increased by 13.6% from Ps.1,111.3 million in 2012 to Ps.1,262.8 million in 2013, due to the increase in payments by our operating subsidiaries under intercompany agreements related to administrative services. These revenues are intercompany and are therefore eliminated in consolidation. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were Ps.2,574.9 million in 2013, a 0.6% decrease from the Ps.2,589.9 million recorded in 2012, primarily as a result of a 11.6% decrease in the cost of construction, a 1.7% decrease in general and administrative expenses, a 9.0% increase in government concession fees and a 4.2% increase in depreciation and amortization. The decrease was partially offset by a 12.2% increase in technical assistance fees and a 1.0% increase in cost of services. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses represented 47.3% of total revenues in 2013 as compared to 50.6% of total revenues in 2012. Operating costs per workload unit decreased 9.1%, from Ps.130.8 per workload unit in 2012 to Ps.118.9 per workload unit in 2013, primarily because of the economies of scale we enjoy in our operating expenses. Cost of services increased 1.1% to Ps.995.2 million in 2013 from Ps.984.5 million in 2012. The increase was principally due to higher energy costs, security and maintenance costs, and professional fees to third parties in connection with ASURs participation in the bidding for the LMM Airport. Our cost of services per workload unit decreased 7.3% from Ps.49.6 in 2012 to Ps.46.0 in 2013 because of the 9.0% increase in workload units and because many of our service costs (such as energy and security) are not directly correlated with the number of workload units. General and administrative expenses decreased 1.7% to Ps.178.6 million in 2013 from Ps.181.6 million in 2012. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower professional fees 113 Table of Contents paid to third parties and lower travel expenses in connection with the bidding process for the LMM Airport. Technical assistance fees increased by 12.2% to Ps.173.3 million in 2013 from Ps.154.4 million in 2012, and government concession fees increased by 9.0% to Ps.223.1 million in 2013 from Ps.204.7 million in 2012. The technical assistance fees increased in 2013 due to the corresponding increase in our consolidated earnings before comprehensive financing costs, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, which is the basis used to determine the technical assistance fee. The increase in government concession fees was primarily the result of an increase in regulated revenues, which is the basis for the calculation of the concession fee. Construction costs were Ps.586.6 million in 2013 and Ps.663.2 million in 2012. Because we hired a third party to provide all of our construction and upgrade services, our revenues relating to construction or upgrade services are equal to our expenses for those services. Depreciation and amortization costs increased by 4.2% to Ps.418.3 million in 2013 from Ps.401.5 million in 2012. This increase was principally due to the depreciation of new investments in fixed assets and improvements made to concessioned assets. Operating Expenses by Airport Operating expenses for Cancún Airport were Ps. 2,083.6 million in 2013, a 1.4% increase from the Ps.2,054.2 million recorded in 2012, primarily as a result of increases in cost of sales, construction costs and technical assistance fees. Operating expenses per workload unit for Cancún Airport were Ps.127.8 in 2013, a 7.9% decrease from the Ps.138.8 recorded in 2012. Operating expenses for Mérida Airport were Ps.181.4 million in 2013, a 11.5% decrease from the Ps. 205.0 million recorded in 2012, principally as a result of a decrease in construction costs. Operating expenses per workload unit for Mérida Airport were Ps. 120.9 in 2013, a 17.4% decrease from the Ps.146.4 recorded in 2012. Operating expenses for Villahermosa Airport were Ps.125.4 million in 2013, a 12.7% decrease from the Ps.143.7 million recorded in 2012, primarily as a result of a decrease in construction costs. Operating expenses per workload unit for Villahermosa Airport were Ps. 114.0 in 2013, a 20.7% decrease from the Ps.143.7 recorded in 2012. Operating expenses for our six other airports were Ps.737.9 million in 2013, a 16.1% increase from the Ps.635.6 million recorded in 2012, principally as a result of an increase in construction costs and an increase in expenses related to our solidarity agreement. Operating expenses per workload unit for our other six airports were Ps.268.4 in 2013, a 14.0% increase from the Ps.235.4 recorded in 2012. Operating expenses for our parent holding company and our administrative services companies were Ps.870.0 million in 2013, a 13.0% increase from the Ps.769.7 million recorded in 2012, principally due to the increase in solidarity agreement expenses. The expenses from our solidarity agreement are intercompany and are therefore eliminated in consolidation. 114 Table of Contents Operating Income Operating income increased 13.5% to Ps.2,871.1 million in 2013 from Ps.2,529.9 million in 2012. This increase in operating income was primarily a result of the 8.0% increase in aeronautical revenues and 10.9% increase in non-aeronautical revenues due to higher passenger traffic and an increase in commercial revenues due to improved terms of commercial agreements. Operating Income by Airport Operating income for Cancún Airport increased by 11.3% to Ps.2,084.5 million in 2013 from Ps.1,873.5 million in 2012, primarily because of the 8.9% increase in aeronautical revenues and 11.1% increase in non-aeronautical revenues due to higher passenger traffic. Operating income per workload unit at Cancún Airport increased 1.0% from Ps.126.6 in 2012 to Ps.127.9 in 2013. Operating income for Mérida Airport increased by 12.1% to Ps.71.6 million in 2013 from Ps.63.9 million in 2012 mainly because of the 94.9% decrease in the revenues of construction services. Operating income per workload unit at Mérida Airport increased 4.8% from Ps.45.6 in 2012 to Ps.47.8 in 2013. Operating income for Villahermosa Airport decreased by 4.3% to Ps.51.0 million in 2013 from Ps.53.3 million in 2012 primarily because of the 74.2% decrease in revenues from construction services and the 42.9% increase in solidarity agreement expenses. Operating income per workload unit at Villahermosa Airport decreased 13.1% from Ps.53.3 in 2012 to Ps.46.3 in 2013. Operating income for our six other airports increased by 37.3% to Ps.271.4 million in 2013 from Ps.197.7 million in 2012 principally because of the 6.1% increase in aeronautical revenues and the 8.8% increase in non-aeronautical revenues due to higher passenger traffic. The income generated by our solidarity agreement is intercompany income and is therefore eliminated in consolidation. Operating income per workload unit at the other six airports increased 35.0% from Ps.73.2 in 2012 to Ps.98.8 in 2013. Operating income for our parent holding company and our administrative services companies increased by 15.0% to Ps.392.8 million in 2013 from Ps.341.6 million in 2012 primarily because of the increase in payments by our operating subsidiaries under intercompany agreements. Comprehensive Financing Result Our net comprehensive financing result decreased by 66.0% to income of Ps.18.6 million in 2013 as compared to income of Ps.54.8 million in 2012, primarily due to a decrease in interest income of 14.3%, from Ps.69.7 million in 2012 to Ps.59.8 million in 2013, and an increase in the exchange rate loss of 64.6%, from Ps.15.5 million in 2012 to Ps.41.1 million in 2013. The increase in exchange rate loss is due to the 0.9% depreciation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during the period and an increase in the principal amount of our U.S. dollar- 115 Table of Contents denominated debt related to the U.S.$215.0 million credit facilities that we incurred in February 2013. Taxes In 2013, our current income tax provision increased 1.1%, from Ps.728.3 million in 2012 to Ps.736.2 million in 2013 primarily due to higher net income before taxes caused by certain of our subsidiaries, including the Veracruz Airport and Caribbean Logistics subsidiaries, and an increase of taxable basis, mainly in our Cancún airport subsidiary. This increase in the current tax provision was partially offset by the net favorable impact related to the Cancún Airports participation in the tax amnesty program. While we paid Ps.128.3 million to settle our tax dispute related to the tax amortization period of our airport concession, we also amended our tax returns for 2012 and 2011 to reflect the revised amortization period. This resulted in a favorable impact of Ps.152.5 million. In addition, due to the participation of our Cancún airport subsidiary in the tax amnesty program, we adjusted the remaining tax basis of our Cancún airport concession which resulted in a tax benefit of Ps. 175.5 million. Our deferred income tax provision moved from a credit of Ps.7.4 million in 2012 to a deferred income tax expense of Ps.94.3 million in 2013 primarily due to the impact of the Mexican federal tax reform. As a result of the change in income tax rates for 2014 and beyond, we readjusted our deferred tax balances to the higher tax rate, resulting in a charge of Ps.122.7 million. Further, due to the repeal of the IETU, we recorded deferred taxes on an income tax basis for certain subsidiaries which had been subject to IETU, resulting in an additional charge of Ps.128.4 million. Our current IETU tax provision decreased 1.4% in 2013, from Ps.8.0 million in 2012 to Ps.7.9 million in 2013 because of a lower taxable base for those airports subject to such tax through December 31, 2013. Our deferred IETU credit increased from Ps.(244.5) million in 2012 to Ps.(404.1) million in 2013 due to the cancellation of the remaining net deferred IETU tax liability resulting from the repeal of the IETU, resulting in a benefit of Ps. 159.1 million. Our asset tax provision was the same in 2013 as in 2012 at Ps.11.5 million. The Company submitted a request to the Mexican Ministry of Finance to receive an opinion on whether we can retain the right to recover part of the asset tax that was paid in prior years. As of April 2010, the Ministry of Finance had refused to issue such an opinion to us. We are currently appealing this decision in Mexican federal court. Our overall effective tax rate in 2013 decreased from to 19.7% to 16.4%, primarily as a result of the changes in Mexican tax law discussed above. Net Income Net income increased 10.7% to Ps.2,296.9 million in 2013 from Ps.2,075.3 million in 2012. This was mainly the result of the 8.0% increase in aeronautical revenues and the 10.9% increase in non-aeronautical revenues, which offset the 0.6% decrease in operating expenses. 116 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity Historically, our operations, financing and investing activities were funded through cash flow from operations, which has generally been used to cover operating expenses, to make dividend payments and to increase our cash balances. However, in 2012, 2013 and 2014, we incurred indebtedness to fund our investments in accordance with our Master Development Plans. See Indebtedness. In 2012 and 2013, we used Ps.1,080.0 million and Ps.2,520.0 million, respectively, to pay dividends, and in 2014, there was no dividend payment. As of December 31, 2014, we had Ps.2,855.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013 In 2014, we generated Ps.2,709.0 million in cash flow from operating activities, an increase of 13.9% from Ps.2,378.3 million in 2013, due to four main factors. First, during 2014, cash flows related to income taxes paid were Ps.1,042.4 million, reflecting an increase of Ps.260.8 million, or 33.4% as compared to 2013, because of the tax basis increase in 2014. Second, in 2013, we recorded positive cash flows of Ps.42.9 million from recovered taxes, which increased to a positive cash flow of Ps.371.8 million in 2014, primarily because we applied a portion of our tax or tax refunds to taxes owed on dividends as of December 31, 2013. Third, during 2014, negative adjustments for non-cash interest gains from our investments were Ps.121.4 million, a decrease of Ps.14.7 million, or 10.8% as compared to 2013. Fourth, during 2014, increases and positive adjustments for non-cash exchange loss from our foreign currency liability position were Ps.167.1 million, a decrease of Ps.108.4 million from 2013. These increases and positive adjustments to cash flow from operating activities were largely due to the fact that our income before income tax increased by Ps.336.1 million, or 12.2%, as compared to 2013 and we reflected a negative adjustment to our cash flow from operating activities in 2014 by Ps.36.4 million to account for gains at Aerostar, our affiliated company, which did not result in a cash loss at ASUR in 2014. Lastly, the line item trade accounts payable and other liabilities increased to a positive cash flow of Ps.21.4 million from a negative cash flow of Ps.169.3 million, largely as a result of unusually low cash outflows in 2014 related to current taxes payable and accounts payable to contractors. Cash flow used in financing activities in 2014 was Ps.98.4 million, a decrease of Ps.21.1 million, or 27.3% from 2013, due to three main factors. First, the absence of bank loans received to offset amounts paid for financing activities in 2014, in contrast to the Ps.4,790.4 million received in 2013 from the disbursements of new bank loans. Second, in 2015 we made bank loan repayments of Ps.16.7 million, a 99.3% decrease from Ps.2,271.4 million in 2013. Third, we did not pay dividends in 2014, in contrast to the Ps.2,520.0 million paid in 2013. Cash flow used in investing activities in 2014 was Ps.1,034.9 million, principally as a result of investments in concessioned assets for Ps.1,156.3 million in 2014, an 87.8% increase from 2013, an interest income of Ps.121.4 million, a 10.8% decrease from 2013, and a debt investment in Aerostar in 2013 by our Cancún Airport subsidiary. 117 Table of Contents Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2012 In 2013, we generated Ps.2,378.3 million in cash flow from operating activities, a decrease of Ps. 271.0 million, or 10.2% from 2012, due to three main factors. First, during 2013, cash flows related to income taxes paid were Ps.781.6 million, reflecting an increase of Ps. 233.0 million, or 42.5% as compared to 2012, because our Cancun airport subsidiary paid Ps.128.3 million for its participation in the tax amnesty program to settle an income tax claim. Second, in 2012, we recorded positive cash flows of Ps.401.3 million from recovered taxes, which decreased to a positive cash flow of Ps.12.5 million in 2013, primarily because we applied a portion of our tax refunds to taxes owed on dividends as of December 31, 2012. Third, during 2013, negative adjustments for non-cash interest gains from our investments were Ps.136.0 million, an increase of Ps.44.0 million, or 47.8% as compared to 2012. These decreases and negative adjustments to cash flow from operating activities were more than offset by the fact that our income before income tax increased by Ps.161.6 million, or 6.3% and we reflected a positive adjustment to our cash flow from operating activities in 2013 by Ps.143.4 million to account for losses at Aerostar, our affiliated company, which did not result in a cash loss at ASUR in 2013. Lastly, the line item trade accounts payable and other liabilities decreased by 97.1% to negative cash flow of Ps.3.8 million from negative cash flow of Ps.129.4 million, largely as a result of unusually high cash outflows in 2012 related to current taxes payable and accounts payable to contractors. Cash flow used in financing activities in 2013 was Ps.77.3 million, a decrease of Ps. 1,406.1 million, or 95.0% from 2012. The decrease of cash flow used in financing activities resulted principally from the disbursements of new bank loans in 2013 totaling Ps.4,790.4 million. These disbursements were more than offset by the payment of dividends of Ps.2,520 million, an increase from Ps.1,080 million in 2012, and repayments of bank loans of Ps.2,271.4 million, an increase from Ps.381.1 million in 2012. Cash flow used in investing activities in 2013 was Ps.3,308.0 million, principally as a result of equity and debt investments in Aerostar by our Cancun airport subsidiary, totaling Ps.4,991.4 million in 2013, of which Ps.2,163.2 million was returned in 2013. In addition, we made Ps.615.9 million of investments in concessioned assets in 2013, a 2.4% decrease from 2012. Indebtedness As of December 31, 2014, we had Ps.3,187.3 million in outstanding indebtedness. In September 2011, Veracruz Airport entered into a three-year credit agreement with Banamex for Ps.50.0 million. The terms included a floating interest rate based on the Tasa de Interés Intercambiaria de Equilibrio, or Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (TIIE) plus 0.75% and quarterly principal payments. Our holding company, GAS, and Aeropuerto de Cancún, S.A. de C.V. guaranteed Veracruz Airports obligations under this facility. We fully drew on this credit facility. On September 19, 2014, this credit facility was fully repaid. 118 Table of Contents In the fourth quarter of 2011, our Cancún airport subsidiary obtained authorization for two new bank loans from Banamex and BBVA Bancomer of U.S.$300.0 million and Ps.1,500.0 million, respectively. These loans remain subject to certain conditions precedent, including the negotiation of definitive documentation for the loans. To date, ASUR has not yet made use of the authorized credit lines. On February 15, 2013, our Cancún airport subsidiary executed a new bank loan with BBVA Bancomer and Merrill Lynch for U.S.$215.0 million. The loan has a five-year term and amortizes in five payments, the first on February 15, 2016, the second on August 15, 2016, the third on February 15, 2017, the fourth on August 15, 2017, of 2.5% of the aggregate amount of the loan made on the borrowing date, and a final payment of the aggregate principal amount of the loan outstanding on the maturity date, February 15, 2018. The loan is denominated in U.S. dollars and charges interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.99%. This facility may be used for general corporate purposes, and we have used it to fund our capital contributions and other financial commitments to Aerostar in connection with the upfront payment due under the Lease of the LMM Airport. Our holding company, GAS, has guaranteed our Cancún airport subsidiarys obligations under this facility. While the BBVA Bancomer and Merrill Lynch facility is outstanding, we and our subsidiaries are not permitted to create any liens upon any of our property, make any fundamental change to our corporate structure, or sell any of our assets that exceed more than 10.0% of our consolidated total assets of as of the most recent fiscal quarter prior to the sale. Additionally, the credit facility requires that we and our subsidiaries maintain a consolidated leverage ratio equal to or less than 3.50:1.00 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio equal to or less than 3.00:1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. If we fail to comply with these covenants, this facility restricts our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Additionally, failure to comply with these covenants would result in all amounts owed under the facility to become due and payable immediately. As of the date of this report, we were in compliance with those covenants. On March 22, 2013, our joint venture Aerostar entered into a U.S.$50.0 million capital expenditure facility and a secured U.S.$10.0 million revolving credit facility with RBC Royal Bank, UBS Financial Services and FirstBank Puerto Rico. Additionally, Aerostar issued 5.75% senior secured notes with an aggregate principal amount of U.S.$350.0 million in a private placement, also secured by Aerostars interest in the lease of LMM Airport. Furthermore, as part of this debt financing, Aerostar was required to pledge its interest in the lease of LMM Airport as collateral to a leasehold mortgagee assigned by the lenders. Our Cancun airport subsidiary and its joint venture partner Highstar Capital IV and its affiliated funds pledged their share ownership in Aerostar as collateral for both of these facilities. However, given that Aerostar is a joint venture and not our subsidiary, we do not consolidate Aerostars assets or liabilities into our financial statements and we provide no credit support other than our Cancún airport subsidiarys pledge of its membership interests in Aerostar to secure the senior credit facilities and the senior notes. As of December 31, 2014, the company has no contracts for interest rate or foreign currency swaps. 119 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures Under the terms of our concessions, every five years our subsidiary concession holders must present a master development plan to the Ministry of Communications and Transportation for approval. Each master development plan includes concession holders investment commitments for the succeeding five-year period, including capital expenditures and improvements. Once approved by the Ministry of Communications and Transportation, these commitments become binding obligations under the terms of our concessions. In December 2013, the Ministry of Communications and Transportation approved each of our master development plans. The current terms of the master development plans went into effect as of January 1, 2014 and will be in effect until December 31, 2018. The following table sets forth our historical investments in the periods indicated. Year ended December 31, (thousands of pesos) 2012 757,545 2013 621,122 2014 1,294,207 In 2014, we spent Ps.1,294.2 million on capital expenditures, principally to finance works at (i) Cancún Airport, including the extension of the terminal building and commercial-aviation apron at Terminal 3, the planning, design and development of the construction of Terminal 4 and the acquisition of airside buses and explosive-trace detectors, and (ii) Veracruz Airport, including the extension of its terminal building. In 2013, we spent Ps.621.1 million on capital expenditures, principally for repairs to the runways in the Cancún, Tapachula and Veracruz Airports, repairs to the fire station in Tapachula Airport, remodeling of Terminal 1 and replacement of a passenger boarding bridges in Cancún Airport, expansion of a platform in the Veracruz Airport and the rehabilitation of roads in the Tapachula and Cancun Airports. In 2012, we spent Ps.757.5 million on capital expenditures, principally for refurbishment of the terminal buildings in the Cancún, Cozumel, Mérida and Minatitlán Airports, the expansion of the terminal buildings in the Villahermosa and Huatulco Airports, and the rehabilitation, shooting and platform and replacement of passenger boarding bridges in the Cancún Airport. We currently intend to fund the investments and working capital required by our business strategy through cash flow from operations and from the indebtedness described above. We may continue to incur debt to finance all or a portion of these investments in the future. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses generated during the reporting period. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and assumptions. The impact and any associated risks related to such policies on our business operations are addressed where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results throughout our discussion of our results of operations. 120 Table of Contents Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to exercise significant judgment. Our most critical accounting policies are described briefly below. For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 5 of our financial statements. Revenue Recognition Revenues are obtained from aeronautical services, which generally relate to the use of airport infrastructure by air carriers and passengers, non-aeronautical services and construction revenues. Aeronautical services revenues consist of passenger charges for departing passengers (excluding diplomats, infants, and transfer and transit passengers), landing charges based on the average between the aircrafts maximum takeoff weight and the zero-fuel weight and hour of arrival, aircraft parking charges based on the time an aircraft is on the ground and hour of arrival, passenger walkway charges for the connection of aircraft to terminals, based on hour of arrival, and airport security charges for departing passengers. Aeronautical services revenue is recognized as passengers depart, at the time of landings and as services are provided, as the case may be. Non-aeronautical service revenues consist primarily of the leasing of space in airport terminals, access fees from third parties providing handling, catering and other services at the airports and miscellaneous other revenues. Rental income is recognized on terminal space that is leased through operating leases. Such leases stipulate either: fixed monthly rental fees or fees based on the greater of a minimum monthly rental fee and a specified percentage of the lessees monthly revenues or the number of departing passengers. Access fees and other service revenues are recognized as services are provided. All amounts are calculated and recognized on a monthly basis. An operator of a service concession that is required to make capital improvements to concessioned assets, such as us, is deemed to provide construction or upgrade services. As a result, we are required to account for the revenues and expenses relating to those services. In our case, because we hire a third party to provide construction and upgrade services, our revenues relating to construction or upgrade services are equal to our expenses for those services. Revenues related to construction and upgrade services are presented in as Construction services and expenses related to construction and upgrade services are presented as Costs of construction. We use the percentage of completion method of accounting to estimate and recognize our revenues and related costs as the construction projects are being undertaken. Under the Airport Law and its regulations, our revenues are classified as Airport Services, Complementary Services or Commercial Services. Airport Services consist primarily of the use of runways, taxiways and aprons for landings and departures, aircraft parking, the use of passenger walkways, security services, hangars, automobile parking facilities as well as the general use of terminal space and other infrastructure by aircraft, passengers and cargo, including the lease of space essential for the operation of airlines and complementary service providers. Complementary Services consist primarily of ramp and handling services, catering, maintenance 121 Table of Contents and repair, as well as related activities to support air carriers. Revenues from access fees charged to third parties providing complementary services are classified as Airport Services. Commercial Services consist of services that are not considered essential to the operation of an airport, such as the lease of space to retailers, restaurants and banks. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon the customers payment history and current creditworthiness. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. Even though these credit losses have historically been within our expectations and we have an established allowance to provide for losses, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past. Since our accounts receivable are concentrated in the hands of a few large customers, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collection of our accounts receivables and our future operating results. Valuation of Airport Concessions We periodically review the carrying value of our airport concessions. This review is based on our projections of anticipated discounted future cash flows over the life of our assets or concessions, as appropriate. Since our airport concessions expire in 2048, significant management judgment is required to estimate these future cash flows. While we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions about such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations including assumptions concerning passenger traffic, changes in rates, inflation and operating costs. Additionally, in analyzing the carrying value of our airport concessions, we compare the aggregate carrying value of all nine of our airport concessions to the net cash flows derived from all of the airports, as we are not permitted to dispose of or cease operating any individual airport. The aggregate net cash flows from all of our airports exceeds the carrying value of the airport concessions. Accordingly, because we analyze our valuation estimates on an aggregate level, we have not recognized any impairment loss in the carrying value of an individual airport concession where the carrying value of the individual airport concession exceeds the net cash flows of that airport. Deferred Income Tax, IETU, Asset Tax and Dividend Tax Our income tax expense, asset tax, and IETU are comprised of current expenses and deferred expenses. Deferred income tax and IETU represent the tax effects of temporary differences generated from the differences in the accounting and tax treatment of balance sheet items, such as our airport concessions and from non-balance sheet items such as tax loss carry-forwards and credits. These temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards and credits are accounted for as deferred tax assets or liabilities on our balance sheet. The corresponding difference between the beginning and year-end balances of the recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities is recorded in earnings. Asset tax was a minimum tax that is calculated as 1.25% of the average tax value of virtually all of our assets. In 2007, we were subject to the asset tax, which may be recovered through deductions over the following ten years of up to 10.0% each 122 Table of Contents year of the total asset tax credit carry-forward at December 31, 2007, provided that this amount does not exceed the difference between the income tax paid in the year and the lowest amount of asset tax paid during each of the three previous years. The asset tax carry-forward may be adjusted for changes in the National Consumer Price Index. The asset tax was eliminated in 2008 in favor of the IETU. Deferred income and IETU assets, dividend tax and recoverable asset tax are recorded at the amounts expected to be realized. We have analyzed each airport on an individual basis and have not recognized the entire amount of the respective deferred tax assets for some of our airport subsidiaries where the level of taxable income necessary to support the recoverability of such assets is not expected in the near future. We have recognized the entire amount of tax loss carry-forwards and deferred tax assets generated by our other airport subsidiaries, whereby taxable profits are expected, because each is taxed on an individual basis and under current tax law these tax carry-forwards can be carried forward through the term of the airport concessions or a period of ten years. As our airport concessions expire in 2048, significant management judgment is applied in the determination of the tax projections. Such tax projections take into consideration a number of factors, including the number of passengers we anticipate in our airports, future operation rates, operation costs, and inflation. There can be no assurance that actual results will be as projected. The Flat Rate Tax (IETU) Law was repealed beginning on January 1, 2014. Accordingly, we have cancelled the deferred IETU of our subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013. Contingent Liabilities We are a party to a number of legal proceedings. Under IFRS, liabilities are recognized in the financial statements when a loss is both estimable and probable. If the loss is neither probable nor estimable or if the likelihood of a loss is remote, no amounts are recognized in the financial statements. Based on legal advice we have received from our Mexican counsel and other information available to us, we have not recognized any losses in the financial statements as a result of these proceedings. Financial Statements of Joint Ventures The financial statements of our joint venture, Aerostar Airport Holdings, LLC are prepared initially in US GAAP and reconciled to IFRS as stated in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The following is a summary of new or revised IFRS standards. For a full description see Note 3.1 in our consolidated financial statements. · IAS 16 (amended), Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets This amendment clarifies that when an item of property, plant or equipment is revalued, the gross carrying value should be restored in a manner consistent with the revaluation and 123 Table of Contents accumulated depreciation should be adjusted to reflect the difference between the gross carrying amount and the book value, taking into account accumulated impairment losses. This amendment went into effect as of July 1, 2014. · IAS 24 (amended), Disclosure of Related Parties The rule is amended to clarify that entities that provide key management personnel services to a reporting entity are related parties to the reporting. It is not necessary to disclose the compensation paid to key management personnel in question, but the amounts charged for services rendered must be disclosed. This amendment went into effect as of July 1, 2014. · IFRS 8 (amended), Operating Segments IFRS 8 requires disclosure of the judgments made by a companys management in applying the aggregation criteria to operating segments. This includes a description of the segments and the economic indicators that have been valued in the managements determination. There is also an amendment stating that an entity shall only provide reconciliations of the total of the reportable segments assets to the entitys assets if the segment assets are reported regularly. This amendment went into effect as of July 1, 2014. · IFRS 9 (amended), Financial Instruments IFRS 9 is the first standard issued as part of a broader project to replace IAS 39. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes two primary categories for measuring financial assets: amortized cost and fair value. The basis of classification depends on the entity´s business model and the contractual characteristics of the financial assets cash flows. This amendment went into effect as of January 1, 2014. Future Standards and Interpretations · IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting This amendment clarifies the meaning of the term elsewhere in the interim report and states that information to be disclosed elsewhere can be done via cross-reference to the interim financial statement or to any other part of the comprehensive report (e.g., to the management commentary or risk report). If users do not have access to the source of the cross-referenced information under the same conditions and at the same time they are released, it is considered that the interim financial statements are incomplete. The effective date of this amendment is January 1, 2016. · IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014. The basic principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in the amount by which the entity expects to be exchanged those goods or services. IFRS 15 applies a five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers: (1) identify the contract with a 124 Table of Contents customer, (2) identify performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) assign the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognize revenue when the entity satisfies the performance obligations. The application of this approach will depend on the facts and circumstances present in the contract and requires judgment. The standard should be applied in the financial statements under IFRS of the entity for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The company management has evaluated that the applying of this IFRS 15 will not have impact on the financial statements. Off-balance sheet arrangements We are not currently, nor have we been, involved in any off-balance sheet arrangement that has or is reasonably likely to have had a current or future effect on our financial statements, changes in liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Tabular disclosure of contractual obligations The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014. Payments due by period (millions of pesos) Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Master Development Plans(1) 6,977.4 1,234.6 4,478.8 1,264.0 0.0 Technical Assistance Agreement(2) 214.2 47.9 83.1 83.1 0.0 Bank Loans 3,187.3 0.0 30.0 3,157.4 0.0 Operating Leases 149.8 3.9 11.8 8.0 126.1 Concession Fees(3)      Total 10,528.7 1,286.4 4,603.7 4,512.5 126.1 (1) As of December 31, 2014, based on the Mexican Construction Price Index. The master development plans, which contain the investment commitments for our airports have been approved for each year through December 31, 2018. The plans also contain indicative investments for calendar years 2018 through 2028, but these amounts are not binding on us. (2) Reflects fixed minimum amount due under the Technical Assistance Agreement. Actual amount to be paid in any year may be higher because technical assistance fees are calculated as the greater of U.S.$2.0 million adjusted annually for inflation against the U.S. consumer price index (subject to certain adjustments) and 5.0% of our annual consolidated earnings before comprehensive financing cost, income taxes and depreciation and amortization (determined in accordance with IFRS and calculated prior to deducting the technical assistance fee). (3) Actual amount to be paid in any year is 5.0% of gross annual revenues. Item 6.

Major Shareholders and Related Party TransactionsMajor Shareholders), José Antonio Pérez Anton and Aurelio Pérez Alonso, directors and senior management do not own shares of ASUR. There are no compensation arrangements under which employees may acquire capital stock of ASUR. Compensation of Directors and Senior Management Members of our Board of Directors and the Board of Directors committees received Ps.8.2 million in aggregate compensation for the year ended December 31, 2014. We paid an aggregate amount of approximately Ps.26.0 million in 2014 for the services of our executive officers. No amount has been set aside by ASUR or its subsidiaries for pension, retirement or similar benefits. Committees Our bylaws provide for four committees to assist the Board of Directors with the management of our business: an Operating Committee, an Audit and Corporate Practices Committee, an Acquisitions and Contracts Committee and a Nominations and Compensation Committee. The Operating Committee, which is composed of four members, is responsible for proposing and approving certain plans and policies relating to our business, investments and administration, including approval of the master development plans of our subsidiary concession holders, our dividend policy and investments of less than U.S.$2.0 million that are not provided for in our annual budget. The Board of Directors appoints all the members of the Operating Committee. Board members elected by the holders of Series BB shares have the right to appoint two of the committee members and to appoint the chairman, who has a deciding vote in the case of a tie. The consent of the Series BB directors is also required to select the members of the Operating Committee that are not members of our board or officers of our company. The current members of the Operating Committee are Fernando Chico Pardo (President), Rasmus Christiansen, Ricardo Guajardo Touché and José Antonio Pérez Antón. A secretary has also been appointed who is not a member of the committee. The Audit and Corporate Practices Committee must be composed of at least three members, all of whom must be independent, and is responsible for supervising the management and conduct of our business, monitoring the activities of our Board of Directors, our officers and the officers of our subsidiaries for compliance with the bylaws and applicable law, as well as coordinating internal auditing activities. With respect to financial reporting and auditing matters, the Audit and Corporate Practices Committee reviews financial data, ensures compliance with the professional code of conduct and has oversight of our internal auditing and controls system, as well as the performance of our external auditors. The Audit and Corporate Practices Committee is also responsible for monitoring transactions with affiliates, including ITA and its stockholders. In addition to the specific duties and authorities set forth under our bylaws and the Securities Market Law for the Audit and Corporate Practices Committee, the Audit and 130 Table of Contents Corporate Practices Committee also has the authority and duties of the Corporate Practices Committee under the Securities Market Law. Our bylaws provide that the Board of Directors shall determine the number of members of the Audit and Corporate Practices Committee, which is required to comprise solely independent directors. All members of the Audit and Corporate Practices Committee must meet the applicable independence criteria set forth under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules issued thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The president of the Audit and Corporate Practices Committee is elected by a vote at the shareholders meeting, as is a secretary, who is not required to be a committee member. The committee also appoints among its members a special delegate who may not be a person appointed by the holders of Series BB shares nor be related to the committee members. The special delegate is charged with ensuring that ITA complies with its obligations under the technical assistance agreement it has with us. The current members of the Audit and Corporate Practices Committee are Ricardo Guajardo Touché (President), Francisco Garza Zambrano and Guillermo Ortiz Martínez. A secretary has also been appointed who is not a member of the committee. The Acquisitions and Contracts Committee, composed of three members, is responsible for ensuring compliance with our procurement policies set forth in our bylaws. Among other things, these policies require that the Acquisitions and Contracts Committee approve any transaction or series of related transactions between us and a third party involving consideration in excess of U.S.$400,000 and that any contract between us, on the one hand, and ITA or any of its related persons, on the other hand, be awarded pursuant to a bidding process involving at least three other bidders. Our bylaws provide that a stockholders meeting will determine the number (which must be an odd number) of members of the Acquisitions and Contracts Committee, which is required to be composed primarily of members of the Board of Directors. The members of the Board of Directors elected by the holders of Series BB shares are entitled to appoint one member to the committee. The current members of the Acquisitions and Contracts Committee are Fernando Chico Pardo (President), Rasmus Christiansen and Aurelio Pérez Alonso. A secretary has also been appointed who is not a member of the committee. The Nominations and Compensation Committee was formed on October 12, 1999. The duties of the committee include the proposal to the general shareholders meeting of candidates for election to the Board of Directors and proposal to the Board of Directors of candidates for appointment as executive officers, as well as proposals to the general shareholders meeting regarding the removal and compensation of directors and officers. Our bylaws provide that a stockholders meeting will determine the number (which must be an odd number) of members of the committee. The holders of the Series B and Series BB shares, acting as a class, are each entitled to name one member of the Nominations and Compensation Committee. The remaining members of the committee are to be named by these two initial members. Members of the committee each have a term of one year. At each annual stockholders meeting after a public offering of our shares, the Nominations and Compensation Committee is required to present a list of at least seven candidates for election as directors for the vote of the Series B stockholders. At an ordinary stockholders meeting held February 28, 2001, our stockholders resolved that the Nominations and Compensation Committee be comprised of three members. The current members of the Nominations and Compensation Committee are Fernando Chico Pardo (President), José Antonio Pérez Antón and Roberto Servitje Sendra. 131 Table of Contents Employees The following table sets forth the number of employees in various positions as of the end of 2012, 2013 and 2014.

ITA Trust The rules governing the sale of our Series BB shares to ITA required that ITA place all of its Series BB shares in trust in order to guarantee ITAs performance of its obligations under the technical assistance agreement and ITAs commitment to maintain its interest in ASUR for a specified period. Accordingly, ITA has placed its shares in trust with Bancomext. This trust, as amended in connection with the conversion of 22,050,000 Series BB shares described above, provides that ITA may instruct Bancomext with respect to the voting of the shares held in trust that currently represent 7.65% of our capital stock, regarding all matters other than capital reductions, payment of dividends, amortization of shares and similar distributions to our shareholders, which are voted by the trustee in accordance with the vote of the majority of the Series B shares. The term of the trust will be extended for an additional fifteen years if, at the end of the initial fifteen-year term, ITA holds shares representing more than 10.0% of our capital stock. ITA may terminate the trust before the second fifteen-year term begins if: (i) ITA holds less than 10.0% of our capital stock at the end of the initial term; and (ii) the technical services agreement has been terminated.

Related Party Transactions General As of December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the accounts pending payment with related parties are as follows: At December 31, 2012 2013 2014 (millions of pesos) Accounts Payable: Inversiones y Técnicas Aeroportuarias, S.A.P.I. de C.V.(2) 35.8 40.3 48.1 Lava Tap de Chiapas, S.

The loan bears interest equal to three month LIBOR plus 2.10%. Aerostar must make interest payments every six months, provided that Aerostars senior indebtedness instruments permit it to make such payments and Aerostar has sufficient working capital. Under Aerostars current senior indebtedness, Aerostar is not permitted to make payments under the subordinated shareholder loan while its capital expenditure and revolving credit facilities are outstanding. These facilities mature on March 21, 2016. Arrangements with ITA The rules for the sale of the Series BB shares required ITA, ASUR and the Ministry of Communications and Transportation to enter into a participation agreement, which established the framework for the option agreement, the Technical Assistance Agreement and the Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior, S.N.C., or Bancomext, Trust Agreement. The participation agreement expired on December 17, 2013. Pursuant to the Technical Assistance Agreement, ITA and its stockholders agreed to provide management and consulting services and transfer industry know-how related to the operation of airports to us. Although Copenhagen Airports ceased to be a shareholder in October 2010, and after the consummation of the sale of a company that owns 49.0% of ITA to Grupo ADO, the Technical Assistance Agreement continues in force and will remain in force. The Technical Assistance Agreement entitles ITA to propose to our board a candidate to be our Chief Executive Officer, to appoint half our other executive officers and two members of our Board of Directors. The agreement also grants us a perpetual and exclusive license in Mexico to use all technical assistance and know-how transferred to us by ITA or its stockholders during the term of the agreement. The agreement had an initial fifteen-year term which expired in 2013, and was automatically renewed for a successive five-year term on the same conditions on December 18, 2013. We are required under this agreement to pay ITA an annual fee equal to the greater of U.S.$2.0 million, adjusted for U.S. inflation, or 5.0% of our annual consolidated earnings before comprehensive financing cost, income taxes and depreciation and amortization (determined in accordance with IFRS and calculated prior to deducting the technical assistance fee under this agreement). The fixed dollar amount decreases during the initial five years of the agreement in order to create an incentive for ITA to increase our earnings before comprehensive financing cost, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. ITA is also entitled to reimbursement for the out-of-pocket expenses it incurs in its provision of services under the agreement. The agreement allows ITA, its stockholders and their affiliates to render additional services to us only 135 Table of Contents if our Acquisitions and Contracts Committee determines that these related persons have submitted the most favorable bid in a bidding process. This process is described in Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesCommittees. In 2012, 2013 and 2014, we recognized expenses of U.S.$9.3 million, U.S.$13.2 million and U.S.$12.9 million, respectively, pursuant to the technical assistance agreement plus additional expenses owed to ITA of approximately U.S.$0.005 million, U.S.$0.010 million and U.S.$ 0.073 million, respectively. Arrangements with Entities Controlled by Fernando Chico Pardo We rent our executive offices in Mexico City from Gafapa, S.A. de C.V., another entity controlled by Fernando Chico Pardo. Compensation to Directors and Officers In 2012, we provided Ps.27.1 million in compensation to key management personnel and Ps.5.5 million in compensation to the Board of Directors and the committees of the Board of Directors. In 2013, we provided Ps.39.1 million in compensation to key management personnel and Ps.4.9 million in compensation to the Board of Directors and the committees of the Board of Directors. In 2014, we provided Ps.26.0 million in compensation to key management personnel and Ps.8.2 million in compensation to the Board of Directors and the committees of the Board of Directors. Item 8.
