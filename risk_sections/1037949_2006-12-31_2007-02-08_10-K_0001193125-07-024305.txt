ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Affecting Our Business Increasing competition, including product substitution, continues to cause access line losses, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial performance. We compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market, and we expect competition to continue to intensify. We are facing greater competition in our core local business from cable companies, wireless providers (including ourselves), facilities-based providers using their own networks as well as those leasing parts of our network, and resellers. As a reseller of wireless services, we face risks that facility-based wireless providers do not have. In addition, regulatory developments over the past few years have generally increased competitive pressures on our business. Due to some of these and other factors, we continue to lose access lines. We are consistently evaluating our responses to these competitive pressures. Our recent responses include product bundling and packaging, our digital voice advertising campaign and focusing on customer service. However, we may not be successful in these efforts. We may not have sufficient resources to distinguish our service levels from those of our competitors, and we may not be successful in integrating our product offerings, especially products for which we act as a reseller, such as wireless services and satellite video services. Even if we are successful, these initiatives may not be sufficient to offset our continuing loss of access lines. If these initiatives are unsuccessful or insufficient and our revenue declines significantly without corresponding cost reductions, this will cause a significant deterioration to our results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect our ability to service debt, pay other obligations, or enhance shareholder returns. Consolidation among participants in the telecommunications industry may allow our competitors to compete more effectively against us, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial performance. The telecommunications industry is experiencing an ongoing trend towards consolidation, and several of our competitors have consolidated with other telecommunications providers. This trend results in competitors that are larger and better financed and affords our competitors increased resources and greater geographical reach, thereby enabling those competitors to compete more effectively against us. We have begun to experience and expect further increased pressures as a result of this trend and in turn have been and may continue to be forced to respond with lower profit margin product offerings and pricing plans in an effort to retain and attract customers. These pressures could adversely affect our operating results and financial performance. Rapid changes in technology and markets could require substantial expenditure of financial and other resources in excess of contemplated levels, and any inability to respond to those changes could reduce our market share. The telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological changes, and our ability to execute our business plans and compete depends upon our ability to develop and deploy new products and services, such as broadband data, wireless, video and VoIP services. The development and deployment of new products and services could also require substantial expenditure of financial and other resources in excess of contemplated levels. If we are not able to develop new products and services to keep pace with technological advances, or if those products and services are not widely accepted by customers, our ability to compete could be adversely affected and our market share could decline. Any inability to keep up with changes in technology and markets could also adversely affect the trading price of our securities and our ability to service our debt. Third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights and defending against these claims could adversely affect our profit margins and our ability to conduct business. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties claiming we have infringed or are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. We may receive similar notices in the future. Responding to these claims may require us to expend significant time and money defending our use of affected technology, may require us to 11 Table of Contents enter into royalty or licensing agreements on less favorable terms than we could otherwise obtain or may require us to pay damages. If we are required to take one or more of these actions, our profit margins may decline. In addition, in responding to these claims, we may be required to stop selling or redesign one or more of our products or services, which could significantly and adversely affect the way we conduct business. Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters Any adverse outcome of the material matters pending against us, which include the remaining securities actions, the KPNQwest litigation and the investigation currently being conducted by the Department of Justice, or DOJ, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results, on the trading price of our debt and equity securities and on our ability to access the capital markets. As described in Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this report, the remaining securities actions, certain of the KPNQwest litigation, and the DOJ investigation present material and significant risks to us. In the aggregate, the plaintiffs in the remaining securities actions and the KPNQwest litigation, as well as persons who, at their request, were excluded from the settlement class in the consolidated securities action, seek billions of dollars in damages. In addition, the outcome of one or more of these matters or the DOJ investigation could have a negative impact on the outcomes of the other actions. Further, the size, scope and nature of the restatements of our consolidated financial statements for 2001 and 2000, which are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, affect the risks presented by many of these matters as they involve, among other things, our prior accounting practices and related disclosures. Plaintiffs in certain of the remaining securities actions have alleged our restatement of items in support of their claims. We continue to defend against the remaining securities actions and the KPNQwest litigation vigorously and are currently unable to provide any estimate as to the timing of their resolution. We can give no assurance as to the impacts on our financial results or financial condition that may ultimately result from these matters. With respect to the remaining securities actions and any additional actions that may be brought by parties who, at their request, were excluded from the settlement class in the consolidated securities action but who have not yet filed suit, we have recorded reserves in our financial statements for the minimum estimated amount of loss we believe is probable. However, the ultimate outcomes of those claims are still uncertain, and the amount of loss we ultimately incur could be substantially more than the reserves we have provided. If the recorded reserves are insufficient, we will need to record additional charges to our consolidated statement of operations in future periods. In addition, settlements or judgments in several of these actions substantially in excess of our recorded reserves could have a significant impact on us. The magnitude of such settlements or judgments resulting from these matters could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to meet our debt obligations, potentially impacting our credit ratings, our ability to access capital markets and our compliance with debt covenants. In addition, the magnitude of any such settlements or judgments may cause us to draw down significantly on our cash balances, which might force us to obtain additional financing or explore other methods to generate cash. Such methods could include issuing additional securities or selling assets. Further, there are other material proceedings pending against us as described in Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this report that, depending on their outcome, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Thus, we can give no assurances as to the impacts on our financial results or financial condition as a result of these matters. Current or future civil or criminal actions against our former officers and employees could reduce investor confidence and cause the trading price of our securities to decline. As a result of our past accounting issues, investor confidence in us has suffered and could suffer further. Although we have consummated a settlement with the SEC concerning its investigation of us, in March 2005, the SEC filed suit against our former chief executive officer, Joseph Nacchio, two of our former chief financial officers, Robert Woodruff and Robin Szeliga, and other former officers and employees. In December 2005, a criminal indictment was filed against Mr. Nacchio charging him with 42 counts of insider trading. 12 Table of Contents Trial is scheduled to begin in March 2007 in connection with the criminal charges against Mr. Nacchio, and a trial could take place in the pending SEC lawsuit against Mr. Nacchio and others. Evidence introduced at such trials and in other matters may result in further scrutiny by governmental authorities and others. The existence of this heightened scrutiny could adversely affect investor confidence and cause the trading price of our securities to decline. We operate in a highly regulated industry and are therefore exposed to restrictions on our manner of doing business and a variety of claims relating to such regulation. Our operations are subject to significant federal regulation, including the Communications Act and FCC regulations thereunder. We are also subject to the applicable laws and regulations of various states, including regulation by public utility commissions, or PUCs, and other state agencies. Federal laws and FCC regulations generally apply to regulated interstate telecommunications (including international telecommunications that originate or terminate in the United States), while state regulatory authorities generally have jurisdiction over regulated telecommunications services that are intrastate in nature. The local competition aspects of the Telecommunications Act are subject to FCC rulemaking, but the state regulatory authorities play a significant role in implementing those FCC rules. Generally, we must obtain and maintain certificates of authority from regulatory bodies in most states where we offer regulated services and must obtain prior regulatory approval of rates, terms and conditions for our intrastate services, where required. Our businesses are subject to numerous, and often quite detailed, requirements under federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that we are always in compliance with all these requirements at any single point in time. The agencies responsible for the enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations may initiate inquiries or actions based on their own perceptions of our conduct, or based on customer complaints. See BusinessRegulation in Item 1 of this report for additional information about regulations affecting our business. Regulation of the telecommunications industry is changing rapidly, and the regulatory environment varies substantially from state to state. A number of state legislatures and state PUCs have adopted reduced or modified forms of regulation for retail services. This is generally beneficial to us because it reduces regulatory costs and regulatory filing and reporting requirements. These changes also generally allow more flexibility for new product introduction and enhance our ability to respond to competition. At the same time, some of the changes, occurring at both the state and federal level, may have the potential effect of reducing some regulatory protections, including having FCC-approved tariffs that include rates, terms and conditions. These changes may necessitate the need for customer-specific contracts to address matters previously covered in our tariffs. Despite these regulatory changes, a substantial portion of our local voice services revenue remains subject to FCC and state PUC pricing regulation, which could expose us to unanticipated price declines. There can be no assurance that future regulatory, judicial or legislative activities will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, or that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations. All of our operations are also subject to a variety of environmental, safety, health and other governmental regulations. We monitor our compliance with federal, state and local regulations governing the discharge and disposal of hazardous and environmentally sensitive materials, including the emission of electromagnetic radiation. Although we believe that we are in compliance with such regulations, any such discharge, disposal or emission might expose us to claims or actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 13 Table of Contents Risks Affecting Our Liquidity Our high debt levels pose risks to our viability and may make us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions, as well as other adverse developments. We continue to carry significant debt. As of December 31, 2006, our total debt was approximately $14.9 billion. Approximately $2.3 billion of our debt obligations comes due over the next three years. In addition, holders of the $1.265 billion of our 3.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the 3.50% Convertible Senior Notes) may elect to convert the principal of their notes into cash during periods when specified, market-based conversion requirements are met. However, we do not anticipate holders will make such an election because the market price of these notes is currently above the estimated conversion value. While we currently believe we will have the financial resources to meet our obligations when they come due, we cannot anticipate what our future condition will be. We may have unexpected costs and liabilities and we may have limited access to financing. In addition, on October 4, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to $2 billion of our common stock over two years. Cash used by us in connection with any purchases of our common stock would not be available for other purposes, including the repayment of debt. We may periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due. We may also need to obtain additional financing or investigate other methods to generate cash (such as further cost reductions or the sale of assets) if revenue and cash provided by operations decline, if economic conditions weaken, if competitive pressures increase or if we become subject to significant judgments, settlements and/or tax payments as further discussed in Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this report and in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7 of this report. We can give no assurance that this additional financing will be available on terms that are acceptable. Also, we may be impacted by factors relating to or affecting our liquidity and capital resources due to perception in the market, impacts on our credit ratings or provisions in our financing agreements that may restrict our flexibility under certain conditions. Our $850 million revolving credit facility (referred to as the Credit Facility), which is currently undrawn, has a cross payment default provision, and the Credit Facility and certain of our other debt issues have cross acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. Any such event could adversely affect our ability to conduct business or access the capital markets and could adversely impact our credit ratings. In addition, the Credit Facility contains various limitations, including a restriction on using any proceeds from the facility to pay settlements or judgments relating to the DOJ investigation and securities actions discussed in Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this report. Our high debt levels could adversely impact our credit ratings. Additionally, the degree to which we are leveraged may have other important limiting consequences, including the following:  placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared with our less leveraged competitors;  making us more vulnerable to downturns in general economic conditions or in any of our businesses;  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and  impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes. We may be unable to significantly reduce the substantial capital requirements or operating expenses necessary to continue to operate our business, which may in turn affect our operating results. The industry in which we operate is capital intensive and, as such, we anticipate that our capital requirements will continue to be significant in the coming years. Although we have reduced our capital 14 Table of Contents expenditures and operating expenses over the past few years, we may be unable to further significantly reduce these costs, even if revenue in some areas of our business is decreasing. While we believe that our current level of capital expenditures will meet both our maintenance and our core growth requirements going forward, this may not be the case if circumstances underlying our expectations change. Declines in the value of qualified pension plan assets, or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding, could require us to provide significant amounts of funding for our qualified pension plan. While we do not expect to be required to make material cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in the near term based upon current actuarial analyses and forecasts, a significant decline in the value of qualified pension plan assets in the future or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding. As a result, we may be required to fund our qualified defined benefit pension plan with cash from operations, perhaps by a material amount. Our debt agreements allow us to incur significantly more debt, which could exacerbate the other risks described in this report. The terms of our debt instruments permit us to incur additional indebtedness. Additional debt may be necessary for many reasons, including to adequately respond to competition, to comply with regulatory requirements related to our service obligations or for financial reasons alone. Incremental borrowings or borrowings at maturity on terms that impose additional financial risks to our various efforts to improve our financial condition and results of operations could exacerbate the other risks described in this report. If we pursue and are involved in any business combinations, our financial condition could be adversely affected. On a regular and ongoing basis, we review and evaluate other businesses and opportunities for business combinations that would be strategically beneficial. As a result, we may be involved in negotiations or discussions that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on our financial condition (including short-term or long-term liquidity) or short-term or long-term results of operations. Should we make an error in judgment when identifying an acquisition candidate, or should we fail to successfully integrate acquired operations, we will likely fail to realize the benefits we intended to derive from the acquisition and may suffer other adverse consequences. Acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including:  incurrence of substantial transaction costs;  diversion of managements attention from operating our existing business;  charges to earnings in the event of any write-down or write-off of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions;  depletion of our cash resources or incurrence of additional indebtedness to fund acquisitions;  an adverse impact on our tax position;  assumption of liabilities of an acquired business (including unforeseen liabilities); and  imposition of additional regulatory obligations by federal or state regulators. We can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions. 15 Table of Contents Other Risks Relating to Qwest If conditions or assumptions differ from the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies, the accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which are described in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this report, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that are considered critical because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events or assumptions differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, these events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Taxing authorities may determine we owe additional taxes relating to various matters, which could adversely affect our financial results. As a significant taxpayer, we are subject to frequent and regular audits from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, as well as from state and local tax authorities. These audits could subject us to risks due to adverse positions that may be taken by these tax authorities. See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this report for examples of legal proceedings involving some of these adverse positions. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we received notices of proposed adjustments on several significant issues for the 1998-2001 audit cycle. Certain of these proposed adjustments are before the Appeals Office of the IRS. And in June 2006 we received notices of proposed adjustments on several significant issues for the 2002-2003 audit cycle, including a proposed adjustment disallowing a loss we recognized relating to the sale of our DEX directory publishing business. There is no assurance that we and the IRS will reach settlements on any of these issues or that, if we do reach settlements, the terms will be favorable to us. Because prior to 1999 we were a member of affiliated groups filing consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns, we could be severally liable for tax examinations and adjustments not directly applicable to current members of the Qwest affiliated group. Tax sharing agreements have been executed between us and previous affiliates, and we believe the liabilities, if any, arising from adjustments to previously filed returns would be borne by the affiliated group member determined to have a deficiency under the terms and conditions of such agreements and applicable tax law. Generally, we have not provided for liabilities of former affiliated members or for claims they have asserted or may assert against us. While we believe our tax reserves adequately provide for the associated tax contingencies, our tax audits and examinations may result in tax liabilities that differ materially from those we have recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Also, the ultimate outcomes of all of these matters are uncertain, and we can give no assurance as to whether an adverse result from one or more of them will have a material effect on our financial results or our net operating loss carryforwards. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, our business and operating results could be materially harmed. We are a party to collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees. In August 2005, we reached agreements with the CWA and the IBEW on three-year labor agreements. Each of these agreements was ratified by union members and expires on August 16, 2008. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time 16 Table of Contents to time. The impact of future negotiations, including changes in wages and benefit levels, could have a material impact on our financial results. Also, if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage, we could incur higher ongoing labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The trading price of our securities could be volatile. The capital markets often experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. The overall market and the trading price of our securities may fluctuate greatly. The trading price of our securities may be significantly affected by various factors, including:  quarterly fluctuations in our operating results;  changes in investors and analysts perception of the business risks and conditions of our business;  broader market fluctuations;  general economic or political conditions;  acquisitions and financings including the issuance of substantial number of shares of our common stock as consideration in acquisitions;  the high concentration of shares owned by a few investors;  sale of a substantial number of shares held by the existing shareholders in the public market, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options or upon the conversion of our convertible notes; and  general conditions in the telecommunications industry.
