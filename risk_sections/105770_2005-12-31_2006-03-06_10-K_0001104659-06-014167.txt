ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Our sales and profitability depend to a large extent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection. If the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system, our sales and profitability could suffer. Our business depends to a substantial extent on customers continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection. Our customers also develop products that use other delivery means, including oral and trans-mucosal. If our customers fail to continue to sell, develop and deploy new injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods, our sales and profitability may suffer. If we are unable to provide comparative value advantages, timely fulfillment of customer orders, or resist pricing pressure, we will have to reduce our prices, which may negatively impact our profit margins. We compete with several companies across our major product lines. Because of the special nature of these products, competition is based primarily on product design and performance, although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control programs across their entire operations. Competitors often compete on the basis of price. We differentiate ourselves from our competition as a full-service value-added supplier that is able to provide pre-sale compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated post-sale technical support on a global basis. However, we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors. If we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our value-added services, improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, or if we have to reduce our prices, our sales and profitability may suffer. We have significant indebtedness and debt service payments which could negatively impact our liquidity. We owe substantial debts and have to commit significant cash flow to debt service requirements. The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: · make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; · limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business; and · make our financial results and share value more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total indebtedness depends on the results of our product development efforts, our future operating performance, our ability to generate cash flow from the sale of our products and on general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors affecting our operations. Many of these factors are beyond our control and our future operating performance could be adversely affected by some or all of these factors. 11 If we incur new indebtedness in the future, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Whether we are able to make required payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to satisfy any other future debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance and our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing. We may experience difficulties integrating the recently acquired operations of TGI and Medimop and we may incur costs relating to acquisitions that are not anticipated. Our success in integrating the newly acquired TGI and Medimop businesses will depend upon our ability to retain key personnel, avoid diversion of managements attention from operational matters, integrate general and administrative services and key information processing systems and, where necessary, re-qualify on customer programs. Integration of the acquired operations may take longer, or be more costly or disruptive to our business, than originally anticipated. The sellers of these businesses have agreed to indemnify us against certain liabilities connected with the business that may arise in the future. Because these indemnities are limited in scope and time, we may incur liabilities that are not reimbursable under the indemnities. We are subject to regulation by governments around the world, and if these regulations are not complied with, existing and future operations may be curtailed, and could be subject to liability. The design, development, manufacturing, marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the United States, Europe and other countries, including the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. The regulatory process can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products. Also, it is possible that regulatory approval may not be obtained for a new product. In addition, our analytical laboratory performs certain contract services for drug manufacturers and is subject to the FDAs current good manufacturing practices regulations. We must also register as a contract laboratory with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. The Drug Enforcement Administration has licensed our contract analytical laboratories to handle and store controlled substances. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Our business may be adversely affected by changes in the regulation of drug products and devices. An effect of the governmental regulation of our customers drug products, devices, and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it costly and time consuming for customers to substitute or replace components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another. In general terms, regulation of our customers products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time. However, if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the cost and time involved for customers to substitute one suppliers components or devices for those made by another, it is likely that the competitive pressure on us would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability. Our business may be adversely affected by risks typically encountered in international operations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world. Sales outside the U.S. account for approximately 51% of consolidated net sales. Although the general business process is similar to the domestic business, international operations are exposed to additional risks, including the following: fluctuations in currency exchange rates; transportation delays and interruptions; political and economic 12 instability and disruptions, especially in Latin and South America and Israel; the imposition of duties and tariffs; import and export controls; the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and potentially adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products, decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations, or comply with applicable customs, currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject, in the event that these laws or regulations change. Raw material prices have a significant impact on our profitability. If raw material prices increase, and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers, our profitability and financial condition may suffer. We use three basic categories of raw materials in the manufacture of our products: elastomers (which includes synthetic and natural material), aluminum and plastic. If we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices to our customers, our profitability, and thus our financial condition, may be adversely affected. The cost of these raw materials has a significant impact on our profitability. The prices of many of these raw materials are cyclical and volatile. For example, the prices of certain commodities, particularly petroleum-based raw materials, have rapidly increased in the recent past, increasing the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic. Supply and demand factors, which are beyond our control, generally affect the price of our raw materials. While we generally attempt to pass along increased raw material prices to our customers in the form of price increases, historically there has been a time delay between increased raw material prices and our ability to increase the prices of our products. Additionally, we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to pricing pressure and other factors. Disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and difficulties in the supplier qualification process, could adversely impact our operations. We utilize a supply chain management strategy in our reporting segments, which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply. This strategy has reduced the number of raw material suppliers used by us. In most cases, we purchase raw materials from a single source to assure quality and reduce costs. Due to regulatory control over our production processes, and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers, we rely on single source suppliers for many critical raw materials. This strategy increases the risks that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem. These risks are managed, where possible, by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites, rigid quality control systems, surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in the case of interruption in production. However, should one of our suppliers be unable to supply materials needed for our products or should our strategies for managing these risks be unsuccessful, we may be unable to complete the process of qualifying new replacement materials for some programs to be qualified in time to meet future production needs. Prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials, difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply, implementing use of replacement materials or new sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or cash flows. 13 A loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations. Our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain these officers and other capable management personnel. With the exception of our Chief Executive Officer, in general, we do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers. We have entered into severance agreements with several of our officers that allow those officers to terminate their employment under particular circumstances, such as a change of control affecting our company. Although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations. In addition, because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce. Our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.
