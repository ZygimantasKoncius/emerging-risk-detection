Item 1A. Risk Factors. Risks Relating to Our Business Our business primarily relies on North American home improvement, repair and new home construction activity levels, all of which are impacted by risks associated with fluctuations in the housing market. Our business primarily relies on home improvement, repair and remodel, and new home construction activity levels, principally in North America. While the North American housing market stabilized during 2010 and 2011, the prolonged decline in the housing market continues to adversely affect these activities, which remain at historically low levels. Low levels of consumer confidence and the downward pressure on home prices have made homeowners hesitant to make additional investments in their homes, particularly for large ticket items such as kitchen and bath remodeling projects. Further, tighter lending standards have limited the ability of consumers to finance home purchases and home improvements. The new home construction market, which is generally cyclical in nature, has undergone a major downturn marked by substantial declines in the demand for new homes, an oversupply of new and existing homes on the market, and a reduction in the availability of financing for homebuyers, and remains at historically low levels. In addition, the high number of home mortgage foreclosures has further added to the oversupply of existing homes held for sale, which has contributed to the sustained downward pressure on home prices as well as the demand for new home construction. We continue to believe long-term trends should result in substantial growth in our markets. Population growth and immigration trends are contributing to increased household formation, which we believe should reduce the existing excess supply of homes in the market. In addition, due to aging housing stock, there is a growing need for replacement, remodeling and repair as well as products to enhance energy efficiency. We also believe that there is growing awareness regarding the importance of adequately protecting family, employees and assets. Although we continue to believe that the long-term outlook for the home products markets is favorable, we cannot predict the timing, strength, or shape of a recovery. As a result, depressed levels of consumer spending on home improvements and new home construction have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Consumers may have been adversely impacted long-term by the global economic recession, economic and housing challenges may continue and a recovery may be slow or may not occur at all, adversely impacting our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Stable economic conditions, including strong employment, consumer confidence and credit availability, are important not only to the basic health of our consumer markets, but also to our own 8 Table of Contents results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While the major economic disruptions of the 2008-2009 recession have largely subsided, significant economic and consumer challenges remain, including sustained high unemployment, low consumer confidence, record budget deficits and levels of government debt, and fragile credit and housing markets. As a result, consumers trading down to lower-priced products and increased focus on value may endure long-term despite a recovery in demand. Consumers may even choose to reduce discretionary spending further or price consciousness may intensify or delay or decrease home ownership and household formation, as well as cause a shift in demand to smaller, less expensive homes, including from single-family to multi-family housing. These factors may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, the prolonged global economic downturn may also adversely impact our access to long-term capital markets, result in increased interest rates on our corporate debt, and weaken operating cash flow and liquidity. Decreased cash flow and liquidity could potentially impact our ability to pay dividends, fund acquisitions and repurchase shares in the future. We operate in very competitive consumer and trade brand categories. The home products market is very competitive. Competition is further intensified during economic downturns. Although we believe that competition in our businesses is based largely on product quality, consumer and trade brand reputation, customer service and product features, as well as fashion, innovation and ease of installation, price is a significant factor for consumers as well as our trade customers. Price sensitive customers may be more likely to trade down to lower-priced products during challenging economic times or if economic conditions worsen. In addition, some of our competitors may resort to price competition to sustain market share and manufacturing capacity utilization. Also, certain large customers continue to offer private-label brands that compete with some of our product offerings as a lower-cost alternative. The strong competition that we face in all of our businesses may adversely affect our profitability and revenue levels, as well as our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We may not successfully develop new products or improve existing products. Our success depends on meeting consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product improvements. We aim to introduce products and new or improved production processes proactively to offset obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. While we devote significant focus to the development of new products, we may not be successful in product development, and our new products may not be commercially successful. In addition, it is possible that competitors may either improve more rapidly or effectively, which could adversely affect our sales. Furthermore, market demand may decline as a result of consumer preferences trending away from our categories or trending down within our brands or product categories, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Risks associated with our ability to improve organizational productivity and global supply chain efficiency and flexibility could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We regularly evaluate our organizational productivity and global supply chains and assess opportunities to reduce costs and enhance quality. We strive to enhance quality, speed and flexibility to meet changing and uncertain market conditions, as well as manage cost inflation, including wages, pension and medical costs. Our success depends in part on refining our cost structure and supply chains to promote consistently flexible and low cost supply chains that can respond to market pressures to protect profitability and cash flow or ramp up quickly and effectively to meet demand. Failure to achieve the desired level of quality, capacity or cost reductions could impair our results of 9 Table of Contents operations, cash flows and financial condition. Despite our efforts to control costs and improve productivity in our facilities, increased competition could still cause lower operating margins and profitability, negatively impacting our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Risks associated with global commodity and energy availability and price and volatility, as well as the possibility of sustained inflation could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We are exposed to risks associated with global commodity price volatility arising from restricted or uneven supply conditions, the sustained expansion and volatility of demand from emerging markets, potentially unstable geopolitical and economic variables, weather and other unpredictable external factors. We buy raw materials that contain commodities such as copper, zinc, steel, glass, wood, and petroleum-based products such as resins. In addition, our distribution costs are significantly impacted by the price of oil and diesel fuel. Decreased availability and increased or volatile prices for these commodities, as well as energy used in making, distributing and transporting our products, could increase the costs of our products. While in the past we have been able to mitigate the impact of these cost increases through productivity improvements and passing on increasing costs to our customers over time, there is no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future, and the risk of potentially sustained high levels of inflation could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we may use derivative contracts to limit our short-term exposure to commodity price volatility, the exposures under these contracts could still be material to our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, in periods of declining commodity prices, these derivative contracts may have the short-term effect of increasing our expenditures for these raw materials. Continued consolidation of our customers could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The consolidation of customers in North America has increased the size and importance of individual customers and creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss. Furthermore, larger customers have greater leverage and can better control the prices we receive for our products and services, our costs of doing business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do business. The loss of certain larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of qualified personnel at all levels, including our senior management team and other key employees. Their motivation, skills, experience, contacts and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and administration. The failure to attract, motivate and retain members of our senior management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial conditions. Risks associated with potential strategic acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We consider acquisitions and joint ventures as a means of enhancing shareholder value. Acquisitions and joint ventures involve risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired companies and operating joint ventures; difficulties retaining the acquired businesses customers and brands; the inability to achieve the expected financial results and benefits of transactions; the loss of 10 Table of Contents key employees from acquired companies; implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, policies and information systems; and diversion of managements attention from other business matters. Future acquisitions could cause us to incur additional debt or issue shares, resulting in dilution in earnings per share and return on capital. We manufacture, source and sell products internationally and are exposed to risks associated with doing business globally. We manufacture, source or sell our products in a number of locations throughout the world, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, China and Europe. Accordingly, we are subject to risks associated with potential disruption caused by changes in political, economic and social environments, including civil and political unrest, terrorism, possible expropriation, local labor conditions, changes in laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments and trade disputes with the U.S., and U.S. laws affecting activities of U.S. companies abroad, including tax laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights. While we hedge certain foreign currency transactions, a change in the value of the currencies will impact our financial statements when translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, fluctuations in currency can adversely impact the cost position in local currency of our products, making it more difficult for us to compete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our businesses through the impact of these potential changes. In addition, we source raw materials, components and finished goods from China where we have experienced higher manufacturing costs and longer lead times due to currency fluctuations, higher wage rates, labor shortages and higher raw material costs. Changes in government and industry regulatory standards could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Government regulations pertaining to health and safety (including protection of employees as well as consumers) and environmental concerns continue to emerge, domestically as well as internationally. It is necessary for us to comply with current requirements (including requirements that do not become effective until a future date), and even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our products or processes in the future. Compliance with these regulations (such as the restrictions on lead content in plumbing products and on volatile organic compounds and formaldehyde emissions that are applicable to many of our businesses) may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing. Such actions could increase our capital expenditures and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and our inability to effectively and timely meet such regulations could adversely impact our competitive position. The inability to secure and protect our intellectual property rights could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation. We have many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to our business. Unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights may not only erode sales of our products, but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation, interfere with our ability to effectively represent the Company to our customers, contractors and suppliers and increase litigation costs. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our brands and trademark rights will prevent violations. In addition, existing patent, trade secret and trademark laws offer only limited protection, and the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not fully protect our intellectual property from infringement by others. Furthermore, others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers. 11 Table of Contents Our businesses rely on the performance of wholesale distributors, dealers and other marketing arrangements and could be adversely affected by poor performance or other disruptions in our distribution channels and customers. We rely on a distribution network comprised of consolidating customers. Any disruption to the existing distribution channels could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The consolidation of distributors or the financial instability or default of a distributor or one of its major customers could potentially cause such a disruption. In addition to our own sales force, we offer our products through a variety of third-party distributors, representatives and retailers. Certain of our distributors, representatives or retailers may also market other products that compete with our products. The loss or termination of one or more of our major distributors, representatives or retailers, the failure of one or more of our distributors or representatives to effectively promote our products, or changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors or representatives could affect our ability to bring products to market. Our postretirement benefit-related costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets, changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions. Increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect our business as a result of: increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation in the United States; the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension plan assets; potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations; and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension plan assets assumption. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. The Companys accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension assets and interest rates. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. Risks associated with the disruption of operations could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell. Any prolonged disruption in our operations, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, lack of raw material or component availability, destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result of natural disasters, fires and explosions, use and storage of hazardous materials or other events) or other reasons, could negatively impact our profitability and competitive position and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a timely manner from suppliers would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products. We purchase raw materials to be used in manufacturing our products and also rely on third-party manufacturers as a source for finished goods. We typically do not enter into long-term contracts with our suppliers or sourcing partners. Instead, most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a purchase order basis. In addition, in some instances we maintain single-source or limited-source sourcing relationships, either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity or price considerations. 12 Table of Contents Financial, operating or other difficulties encountered by our suppliers or sourcing partners or changes in our relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions, delays and inefficiencies, and prevent us from manufacturing or obtaining the finished goods necessary to meet customer demand. If we are unable to meet customer demand, there could be an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Future tax law changes or the interpretation of existing tax laws may materially impact our effective income tax rate and the resolution of unrecognized tax benefits. Our businesses are subject to income taxation in the U.S. as well as internationally. It is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material adverse impact on our worldwide income tax provision. We are routinely audited by income tax authorities in many jurisdictions. Although we believe that the recorded tax estimates are reasonable and appropriate, there are significant uncertainties in these estimates. As a result, the ultimate outcome from any audit could be materially different from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Future settlements of income tax audits may have a material adverse effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in our financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement. Potential liabilities and costs from claims and litigation could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We are, from time to time, involved in various claims, litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and which could have a material adverse effect on us. These matters may include contract disputes, intellectual property disputes, personal injury claims, warranty disputes, environmental claims or proceedings, other tort claims, employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation, including class actions. It is not possible to predict the outcome of pending or future litigation, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that some of the actions could be decided unfavorably and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant accident, judgment, claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We are subject to product safety regulations, recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, can be costly to defend. As a result of the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers. Increasingly, homebuilders, including our customers, are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business. Our contractual arrangements with these customers typically include the agreement to indemnify them against liability for the performance of our products or services or the performance of other products that we install. These claims, often asserted several years after completion of construction, frequently result in lawsuits against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors, including us, and require us to incur defense costs even when our products or services are not the principal basis for the claims. 13 Table of Contents An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of other intangible assets represents the fair value of trademarks, tradenames and other acquired intangible assets as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated for impairment by our management at least annually. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by using a weighting of the income and market approaches. For the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model, estimating the future cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates, and then discounting the future cash flows at a market-participant-derived weighted-average cost of capital. For the market approach, we apply market multiples for peer groups to the operating results of the reporting units to determine each reporting units fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the goodwill is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. Events and conditions that could result in further impairments include contractions in the North American housing market and a change in the timing and pace of the recovery from the recent global recession. In addition, further impairment could be caused by changes in the consumer categories in which we operate, increased competition, a significant product liability or intellectual property claim or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability. If the value of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets is impaired, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may experience delays or outages in our information technology system and computer networks. We, like most companies, may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by delays or disruptions due to system updates, natural disasters, malicious attacks, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. Our businesses may implement enterprise resource planning systems or add applications to replace outdated systems and to operate more efficiently. Predictions regarding benefits resulting from the implementation of these projects are subject to uncertainties. We may not be able to successfully implement the projects without experiencing difficulties. In addition, any expected benefits of implementing projects might not be realized or the costs of implementation might outweigh the benefits realized. We may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could damage our reputation and consumer relationships. Such breaches could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. In particular, the Security & Storage business is increasingly utilizing digital elements that may allow consumers to use and store personally identifiable information through online services operated by Master Lock. Such information may include names, passwords, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. We devote appropriate resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. In the event of a breach, we would be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. 14 Table of Contents We are subject to credit risk on our accounts receivable. Our outstanding trade receivables are generally not covered by collateral or credit insurance. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance that such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and operating results. In addition, it is possible that continued weak economic conditions may cause significantly higher levels of customer defaults and bad debt expense in future periods than is contemplated by our current allowances for doubtful accounts. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us. From time to time we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Although we believe that the sources of capital currently in place permit us to finance our operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to: (1) our financial performance, (2) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (3) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (4) the state of the economy, including the U.S. housing market. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, even if that change may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders. The existence of some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law may discourage a future takeover attempt not approved by our Board of Directors but which our stockholders may deem to be in their best interests or in which stockholders may receive a substantial premium for their shares over then current market prices. These provisions include but are not limited to a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, no stockholder ability to fill director vacancies, elimination of the rights of our stockholders to act by written consent and call special stockholder meetings, super-majority vote requirements for certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and stockholder proposals for amendments to our bylaws, prohibiting stockholders from removing directors other than for cause and rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board of Directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock. We believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in our best interests or the best interests of our stockholders. 15 Table of Contents Risks Relating to Our Recent Separation If the Distribution (as defined below), together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we, our Former Parent and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability. Our Former Parent has received a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of all the shares of our common stock owned by our Former Parent to stockholders of our Former Parent as of September 20, 2011 (the Distribution) qualifies as tax-free under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares of our stock. In addition, the private letter ruling provides that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distribution will qualify for favorable treatment under the Code. In addition to obtaining the private letter ruling, our Former Parent has received an opinion from the law firm of McDermott Will & Emery LLP confirming the tax-free status of the Distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including confirming the satisfaction of the requirements under Section 355 of the Code not specifically addressed in the IRS private letter ruling. The private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations from us and our Former Parent regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the Distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the Distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the Distribution. Under the terms of the Tax Allocation Agreement we entered into in connection with the Distribution, in the event that the Distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the Distribution by us, any of our affiliates or our stockholders, we would be responsible for all taxes imposed on our Former Parent as a result thereof. Such tax amounts could be significant. We have limited operating history as an independent, publicly-traded company, and our historical financial statements are not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company and may not be reliable indicators of our future results. Our historical financial statements do not necessarily reflect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition that we would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of the following factors: > Historically, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, were financed by our Former Parent. Prior to the Separation, our Former Parent managed and retained cash we generated. Following completion of the Separation, our Former Parent ceased providing us with funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements. Without the opportunity to obtain financing from our Former Parent, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements, and such arrangements may not be available to us or available on terms that are as favorable as those we could have obtained when we were part of our Former Parent. > Prior to the Separation, our business was operated by our Former Parent as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Our Former Parent historically performed various corporate functions for us, including, but not limited to, tax administration, treasury activities, accounting, legal, ethics and compliance program administration, investor and public relations, certain governance functions (including internal audit) and external reporting. 16 Table of Contents Our historical financial statements reflect allocations of corporate expenses from our Former Parent for these and similar functions. These allocations may be more or less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as an independent, publicly traded company. > Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of our operation as a company separate from our Former Parent. We might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances because of certain restrictions relating to requirements for tax-free distributions. Our ability to engage in significant equity transactions is limited or restricted to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the Distribution by our Former Parent. Even if the Distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code, it may result in corporate level taxable gain to our Former Parent under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of shares of our stock or our Former Parents stock are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Separation. Any acquisitions or issuances of our stock or our Former Parents stock within two years after the Distribution are generally presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or our Former Parent may be able to rebut that presumption. To preserve the tax-free treatment to our Former Parent of the Distribution, under the Tax Allocation Agreement that we entered into with our Former Parent, we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the Distribution and related transactions from being tax-free. Further, for the two-year period following the Distribution, without obtaining the consent of our Former Parent, a private letter ruling from the IRS or an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized law firm, we are prohibited from: > approving or allowing any transaction that results in a change in ownership of more than a specified percentage of our common stock, > redeeming any equity securities, > selling or disposing of a specified percentage of our assets, > acquiring a business or assets with equity securities to the extent one or more persons would acquire in excess of a specified percentage of our common stock or > engaging in certain internal transactions. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. Moreover, the Tax Allocation Agreement also provides that we are responsible for any taxes imposed on our Former Parent or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the Distribution or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the Code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the Distribution by or in respect of us, any of our affiliates or our stockholders. The indemnification arrangements we entered into with our Former Parent in connection with the Separation may require us to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to our Former Parent and may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of losses for which our Former Parent indemnifies us. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Indemnification Agreement and certain other agreements, our Former Parent agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify our Former Parent for certain liabilities, as discussed further in the sections entitled Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Fortune Brands, Inc. included in 17 Table of Contents the Information Statement of our Registration Statement on Form 10. Indemnities that we may be required to provide our Former Parent may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Distribution. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that our Former Parent has agreed to retain. Further, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from our Former Parent will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that our Former Parent will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from our Former Parent any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. A court could deem the Distribution to be a fraudulent conveyance and void the transaction or impose substantial liabilities upon us. A court could deem the Distribution or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by our Former Parent in connection with the Separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. A court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Among other things, the court could require our stockholders to return to our Former Parent, for the benefit of its creditors, some or all of the shares of our common stock issued in the Distribution, or require us to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the restructuring transaction. Whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer under applicable state law may vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including: > a shift in our investor base; > our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry; > actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; > success or failure of our business strategy; > our ability to obtain financing as needed; > changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; > changes in laws and regulations affecting our business; > announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; > the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock; > changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet our earnings guidance; > the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; and > overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions. 18 Table of Contents Stock markets in general have also experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. We currently do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the short term. All decisions regarding our payment of dividends will be made by our Board of Directors from time to time in accordance with applicable law. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures or increases in reserves. If we do not pay dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate for you to receive a gain on your investment. This appreciation may not occur. Further, you may have to sell some or all of your shares of our common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.
