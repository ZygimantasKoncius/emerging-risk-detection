Item 1A. Risk Factors Table of Contents 32 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2015 extended periods of time. We recently experienced denial of service attacks that targeted a third party service provider that provides software and customer services with respect to our online deposit taking activities, which resulted in temporary disruptions in customersÂ’ ability to perform online banking transactions, although no customer data was lost or compromised. Even if not directed at CIT specifically, attacks on other entities with whom we do business or on whom we otherwise rely or attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of our business. Since January 1, 2013, we have not experienced any material information security breaches involving either proprietary or customer information. However, if we experience cyber attacks or other information security breaches in the future, either the Company or its customers may suffer material losses. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the prominent size and scale of CIT and its role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement our online banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our expanded geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
