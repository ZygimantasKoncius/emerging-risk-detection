Risk Factors. Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including the risks described below. You should carefully consider these risks when evaluating us and our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. We are also subject to a variety of risks that affect many other companies generally, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we currently believe are not as significant as the risks described below. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the trading prices of our securities, may be materially and adversely affected. Our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices. Our business depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production in markets worldwide. Worldwide demand for oil and gas, oil and gas prices, market expectations of potential changes in these prices and a variety of political and economic factors significantly affect this level of activity. However, higher or lower commodity demand and prices do not necessarily translate into increased or decreased drilling activity since our customers project development time, reserve replacement needs, as well as expectations of future commodity demand and prices all combine to affect demand for our rigs. Oil and gas prices have been, and are expected to continue to be, extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:  worldwide demand for oil and gas;  the level of economic activity in energy-consuming markets;  the worldwide economic environment or economic trends, such as recessions;  the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly called OPEC, to set and maintain production levels and pricing;  the level of production in non-OPEC countries;  the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities in the Middle East, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;  civil unrest;  the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves;  available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation and refining capacity;  the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital;  weather conditions in the United States and elsewhere;  natural disasters or incidents resulting from operating hazards inherent in offshore drilling, such as oil spills;  the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves;  development and exploitation of alternative fuels or energy sources;  competition for customers drilling budgets from land-based energy markets around the world;  domestic and foreign tax policy; and  advances in exploration and development technology. Governmental laws and regulations, both domestic and international, may add to our costs or limit our drilling activity. Our operations are affected from time to time in varying degrees by governmental laws and regulations. The drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and, accordingly, is affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally. We may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or may significantly limit drilling activity. In the aftermath of the Macondo well blowout in April 2010 and the subsequent investigation into the causes of the event, new rules for oil and gas operations on the Outer Continental Shelf, or OCS, have been implemented, including new standards for well design, casing and cementing and well control procedures, as well as rules requiring operators to systematically identify risks and establish safeguards against those risks through a comprehensive safety and environmental management system, or SEMS. New regulations may continue to be 10 Table of Contents announced, including rules regarding employee training, engaging personnel in safety management and requiring third party audits of SEMS programs. We are not able to predict the likelihood, nature or extent of additional rulemaking, nor are we able to predict the future impact of these events on our operations. Additional governmental regulations concerning licensing, taxation, equipment specifications, training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of our operations, and escalating costs borne by our customers could reduce exploration activity in the GOM and therefore demand for our services. Governments in some countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities. As awareness of climate change issues increases, governments around the world are beginning to address the matter. This may result in new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us, our suppliers and our customers. We may be exposed to risks related to new laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use that could decrease the use of oil or natural gas, thus reducing demand for hydrocarbon-based fuel and our drilling services. Governments may also pass laws or regulations encouraging or mandating the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind power and solar energy, which may reduce demand for oil and natural gas and our drilling services. In addition, new laws or regulations, including those that may come into effect following the Macondo incident, may require an increase in our capital spending for additional equipment to comply with such requirements and could also result in a reduction in revenues associated with downtime required to install such equipment. Our business involves numerous operating hazards which could expose us to significant losses and significant damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us. Our operations are subject to the significant hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, unstable or faulty sea floor conditions, fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes. The occurrence of any of these types of events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel, damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations, and oil spillage, oil leaks, well blowouts and extensive uncontrolled fires, any of which could cause significant environmental damage. In addition, offshore drilling operations are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages. Any of the foregoing events could result in significant damage or loss to our properties and assets, significant loss of revenues, and significant damage claims against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Consistent with industry practice, our contracts with our customers generally contain contractual rights to indemnity from our customer for, among other things, pollution originating from the well, while we retain responsibility for pollution originating from the rig. However, our contractual rights to indemnification may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts of commission or omission by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers and our customers may dispute, or be unable to meet, their contractual indemnification obligations to us. We maintain liability insurance, which includes coverage for environmental damage; however, because of contractual provisions and policy limits, our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses and claim costs. In addition, pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable when they are determined to be the result of criminal acts. Also, we do not typically purchase loss-of-hire insurance to cover lost revenues when a rig is unable to work. Moreover, insurance costs across the industry have increased following the Macondo incident and, in the future, certain insurance coverage is likely to become more costly and may become less available or not available at all. Accordingly, it is possible that our losses from the hazards we face could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We believe that the policy limit under our marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of our size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for our business. However, if an accident or other event occurs that exceeds our coverage limits or is not an insurable event under our insurance policies, or is not 11 Table of Contents fully covered by contractual indemnity, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will continue to carry the insurance we currently maintain, that our insurance will cover all types of losses or that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify us will necessarily be financially able to indemnify us against all of these risks. In addition, no assurance can be made that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider to be reasonable or that we will be able to obtain insurance against some risks. Accordingly, the occurrence of any of the hazards we face could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations. In the United States and in many of the international locations in which we operate, regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment apply to some of our operations. For example, we, as an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in navigable United States waters and some offshore areas, may be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to those operations. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent, and may in some cases impose strict liability, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. The United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA 90, and similar legislation enacted in Texas, Louisiana and other coastal states, addresses oil spill prevention and control and significantly expands liability exposure across all segments of the oil and gas industry. OPA 90 and such similar legislation and related regulations impose a variety of obligations on us related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. OPA 90 imposes strict and, with limited exceptions, joint and several liability upon each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. The application of these requirements or the adoption of new requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition. The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. Some of our competitors may have greater financial or other resources than we do. The drilling industry has experienced consolidation in the past and may experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large competitors. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job; however, rig availability and location, a drilling contractors safety record and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment may also be considered. Our industry has historically been cyclical. There have been periods of lower demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates, followed by periods of high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates. We cannot predict the timing or duration of such business cycles. Periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time. In response to a contraction in demand for certain types of our drilling rigs, primarily our shallow water jack-up rigs, we have cold stacked eight rigs as of the date of this report. We also may be required to idle additional rigs or to enter into lower rate contracts. Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of our drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable. Significant new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling units could also intensify price competition. As of the date of this report, based on analyst reports, we believe that there are approximately 77 jack-up rigs and 96 floaters on order and scheduled for delivery between 2012 and 2018, with approximately half of these rigs scheduled for delivery in the next two years. The resulting increases in rig supply could be sufficient to depress rig utilization and intensify price competition from both existing competitors, as well as new entrants into the offshore drilling market. As of the date of this report, not all of the rigs currently under construction have been contracted for future work, which may further intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur. The majority of the floaters 12 Table of Contents on order are dynamically positioned drilling units, which further increases competition with our fleet in certain circumstances, depending on customer requirements. In Brazil, Petrobras, which accounted for approximately 35% of our consolidated revenues in 2011 and, as of February 1, 2012, accounted for approximately $3.7 billion of our contract drilling backlog through 2016 and to which ten of our floaters are currently contracted, has announced plans to construct locally 33 new deepwater drilling units to be delivered beginning in 2015. These new drilling units would increase rig supply and could intensify price competition in Brazil as well as other markets as they enter the market, would compete with, and could displace, our deepwater and ultra-deepwater floaters coming off contract and could materially adversely affect our utilization rates, particularly in Brazil. We can provide no assurance that our current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized. As of the date of this report, our contract drilling backlog was approximately $8.6 billion for contracted future work extending, in some cases, until 2019. Generally, contract backlog only includes future revenues under firm commitments; however, from time to time, we may report anticipated commitments for which definitive agreements have not yet been, but are expected to be, executed. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond our control or that we will be able to ultimately execute a definitive agreement in cases where one does not currently exist. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our customers will be able to or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments to us. Our inability to perform under our contractual obligations or to execute definitive agreements or our customers inability to fulfill their contractual commitments to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview  Contract Drilling Backlog included in Item 7 of this report. We rely heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer and/or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We provide offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. In 2011, our five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 62% of our consolidated revenues. We expect Petrobras and OGX, which accounted for approximately 35% and 14% of our consolidated revenues in 2011, respectively, to continue to be significant customers in 2012. Our contract drilling backlog, as of the date of this report, includes $1.3 billion, or 51% of our total contracted backlog for 2012, which is attributable to contracts with Petrobras and OGX for operations offshore Brazil. While it is normal for our customer base to change over time as work programs are completed, the loss of any major customer may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview  Contract Drilling Backlog included in Item 7 of this report. The terms of our drilling contracts may limit our ability to attain profitability in a declining market or to benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market. The duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by customer requirements and, to a lesser extent, the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractors. In periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, drilling contractors generally prefer longer term contracts, but often at flat or slightly lower dayrates, to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of lower dayrates. Conversely, in periods of rising demand for offshore rigs, contractors typically prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly profit from increasing dayrates. In contrast, during these periods customers with reasonably definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent level. An inability to obtain longer term contracts in a declining market or to fully benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market through shorter term contracts may limit our profitability. Contracts for our drilling units are generally fixed dayrate contracts, and increases in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability on those contracts. Our contracts for our drilling units provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating day, although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs incurred by us. Many of our operating costs, such as labor costs, are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond our control. The gross margin that we realize on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in our operating costs over the terms of the contracts. In addition, for contracts with dayrate escalation clauses, we may not be able to fully recover increased or unforeseen costs from our customers. Our inability to recover these increased or unforeseen costs from our customers could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 13 Table of Contents Our drilling contracts may be terminated due to events beyond our control. Our customers may terminate some of our term drilling contracts if the drilling unit is destroyed or lost or if we have to suspend drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party. In addition, some of our drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually specified termination amounts. These termination payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract. In addition, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. During periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers seeking to repudiate their contracts. Our customers ability to perform their obligations under drilling contracts with us may also be adversely affected by restricted credit markets and the economic downturn. If our customers cancel some of their contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are disputed or suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated, it could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. A significant portion of our operations are conducted outside the United States and involve additional risks not associated with domestic operations. We operate in various regions throughout the world which may expose us to political and other uncertainties, including risks of:  terrorist acts, war and civil disturbances;  piracy or assaults on property or personnel;  kidnapping of personnel;  expropriation of property or equipment;  renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;  changing political conditions;  foreign and domestic monetary policies;  the inability to repatriate income or capital;  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions;  travel limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats; and  changing taxation policies. We are subject to the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control and other U.S. laws and regulations governing our international operations in addition to worldwide anti-bribery laws. In addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to:  the equipping and operation of drilling units;  import-export quotas or other trade barriers;  repatriation of foreign earnings or capital;  oil and gas exploration and development;  taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; and  use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors. Some foreign governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors, require use of a local agent or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These practices may adversely affect our ability to compete in those regions. It is difficult to predict what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry. The actions of foreign governments may materially and adversely affect our ability to compete. 14 Table of Contents In addition, the shipment of goods, including the movement of a drilling rig across international borders, subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations that differ in each of the countries in which we operate and often impose record keeping and reporting obligations. The laws and regulations concerning import/export activity and record keeping and reporting requirements are complex and change frequently. These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended enforced and/or interpreted in a manner that could materially and adversely impact our operations. Shipments can be delayed and denied export or entry for a variety of reasons, some of which may be outside of our control. Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled downtime for our rigs. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal and civil penalties, economic sanctions, seizure of shipments and/or the contractual withholding of monies owed to us, among other things. As of the date of this report, the greatest concentration of our operating assets outside the United States was offshore Brazil, where we had 14 rigs in our fleet either currently working or contracted to work during 2012. We may enter into drilling contracts that expose us to greater risks than we normally assume. From time to time, we may enter into drilling contracts with national oil companies, government-controlled entities or others that expose us to greater risks than we normally assume, such as exposure to greater environmental or other liability and more onerous termination provisions giving the customer a right to terminate without cause or upon little or no notice. Upon termination, these contracts may not result in a payment to us, or if a termination payment is required, it may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract. In addition, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For example, we currently operate, and expect to continue to operate, our drilling rigs offshore Mexico for PEMEX  Exploración y Producción, or PEMEX, the national oil company of Mexico. The terms of these contracts expose us to greater environmental liability than we normally assume, and provide that, among other things, each contract can be terminated by PEMEX on short notice, contractually or by statute, subject to certain conditions. While we believe that the financial terms of these contracts and our operating safeguards in place mitigate these risks, we can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have a material negative impact on our future operations or financial results. Fluctuations in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in losses to us. Due to our international operations, we have experienced currency exchange losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where we do not effectively hedge an exposure to a foreign currency. We may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital. We can provide no assurance that financial hedging arrangements will effectively hedge any foreign currency fluctuation losses that may arise. Changes in laws, effective income tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns could adversely affect our financial results. Tax laws and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation and disputes. We conduct our worldwide operations through various subsidiaries in a number of different jurisdictions. We are subject to the tax laws, tax regulations and income tax treaties within and between the countries in which we operate as well as countries in which we may be resident. We determine our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in each jurisdiction for the period during which we operate and earn income. Our overall effective tax rate could be adversely and suddenly affected by lower than anticipated earnings in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax law, tax treaties, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof in one or more countries in which we operate. Our income tax returns are subject to review and examination. We do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority. If any tax authority successfully challenges any tax position taken, or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our operations, or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country, our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase substantially and our earnings and cash flows from operations could be materially adversely affected. 15 Table of Contents We may be required to accrue additional tax liability on certain of our foreign earnings. Certain of our international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, or DOIL, a Cayman Islands subsidiary which we wholly own. It is our intention to indefinitely reinvest future earnings of DOIL and its foreign subsidiaries to finance foreign activities. We do not expect to provide for U.S. taxes on any future earnings generated by DOIL, except to the extent that these earnings are immediately subjected to U.S. federal income tax. Should a future distribution be made from any unremitted earnings of this subsidiary, we may be required to record additional U.S. income taxes that, if material, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Acts of terrorism and other political and military events could adversely affect the markets for our drilling services. Terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in the U.S. and abroad, the continuation or escalation of existing armed hostilities or the outbreak of additional hostilities could lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and a downturn in the economies of the U.S. and other countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption or an increase in the volatility of energy prices, either of which could materially and adversely affect the market for our offshore drilling services, our dayrates or utilization and, accordingly, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. While we take steps that we believe are appropriate to secure our energy assets, there is no assurance that we can completely secure these assets, completely protect them against a terrorist attack or other political and military events or obtain adequate insurance coverage for such events at reasonable rates. We may be subject to litigation that could have a material adverse effect on us. We are, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment and tax matters and other litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. Although we intend to defend these matters vigorously, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter, and there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any litigation. Litigation may have a material adverse effect on us because of potential adverse outcomes, defense costs, the diversion of our managements resources and other factors. Failure to obtain and retain highly skilled personnel could hurt our operations. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. To the extent that demand for drilling services and the size of the worldwide industry fleet increase (including due to the impact of newly constructed rigs), shortages of qualified personnel could arise, creating upward pressure on wages and difficulty in staffing and servicing our rigs, which could adversely affect our results of operations. As of the date of this report, we have three new ultra-deepwater drillships under construction which will require additional skilled personnel to operate. In addition, additional new capacity in the offshore drilling market could cause further competition for qualified and experienced personnel as these entities seek to hire personnel with expertise in the offshore drilling industry. The heightened competition for skilled personnel could materially and adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows by limiting our operations or further increasing our costs. Although we have paid special cash dividends in the past, we may not pay special cash dividends in the future and we can give no assurance as to the amount or timing of the payment of any future special cash dividends. We have adopted a policy to consider paying special cash dividends, in amounts to be determined, on a quarterly basis. Any determination to declare a special cash dividend, as well as the amount of any special cash dividend which may be declared, will be based on our financial position, earnings, earnings outlook, capital spending plans and other factors that our Board of Directors considers relevant at that time. Moreover, our dividend policy may change from time to time. We cannot assure you that we will continue to declare any special cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts. If in the future we pay special cash dividends less frequently or in smaller amounts, or cease to pay any special cash dividends, it could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. See Market for the Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  Dividend Policy included in Item 5 of this report and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Historical Cash Flows included in Item 7 of this report. 16 Table of Contents Rig conversions, upgrades or new-builds may be subject to delays and cost overruns. From time to time we may undertake to add new capacity through conversions or upgrades to our existing rigs or through new construction, such as our three new, ultra-deepwater drillships under construction and our construction of the Ocean Onyx. Projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:  shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;  work stoppages;  unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;  unanticipated cost increases;  weather interferences;  difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions;  design and engineering problems;  customer acceptance delays;  shipyard failures or unavailability; and  failure or delay of third party service providers and labor disputes. Failure to complete a rig upgrade or new construction on time, or failure to complete a rig conversion or new construction in accordance with its design specifications may, in some circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling contract, resulting in a loss of contract drilling backlog and revenue to us. If a drilling contract is terminated under these circumstances, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract with equally favorable terms. We have elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Because the amount of insurance coverage available to us is limited, and the cost for such coverage is substantial, we have elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This results in a higher risk of losses, which could be material, that are not covered by third party insurance contracts. If one or more named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico cause significant damage to our rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our debt levels may limit our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1.5 billion in long-term debt. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations is dependent upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our debt levels and the terms of our indebtedness could potentially limit our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing, at rates which we consider reasonable or at all, and, thus, could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities. In addition, our overall debt level and/or market conditions could lead the credit rating agencies to lower our corporate credit ratings. A downgrade in our corporate credit ratings could impact our ability to issue additional debt by raising the cost of issuing new debt. As a consequence, we may not be able to issue additional debt in amounts and/or with terms that we consider to be reasonable. This could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities. We are controlled by a single stockholder, which could result in potential conflicts of interest. Loews Corporation, which we refer to as Loews, beneficially owned approximately 50.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of February 16, 2012 and is in a position to control actions that require the consent of stockholders, including the election of directors, amendment of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and any merger or sale of substantially all of our assets. In addition, three officers of Loews serve on our Board of Directors. One of those, James S. Tisch, the Chairman of the Board of our company, is also the Chief Executive Officer and a director of Loews. We have also entered into a services agreement and a registration rights agreement with Loews and we may in the future enter into other agreements with Loews. 17 Table of Contents Loews is a holding company. In addition to us, its principal subsidiaries are CNA Financial Corporation, a 90% owned subsidiary engaged in commercial property and casualty insurance; HighMount Exploration & Production LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary engaged in exploration, production and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids; Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, a 61% owned subsidiary engaged in the operation of interstate natural gas transmission pipeline systems; and Loews Hotels Holding Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary engaged in the operation of hotels. It is possible that Loews may in some circumstances be in direct or indirect competition with us, including competition with respect to certain business strategies and transactions that we may propose to undertake. In addition, potential conflicts of interest exist or could arise in the future for our directors who are also officers of Loews with respect to a number of areas relating to the past and ongoing relationships of Loews and us, including tax and insurance matters, financial commitments and sales of common stock pursuant to registration rights or otherwise. Although the affected directors may abstain from voting on matters in which our interests and those of Loews are in conflict so as to avoid potential violations of their fiduciary duties to stockholders, the presence of potential or actual conflicts could affect the process or outcome of Board deliberations. We cannot assure you that these conflicts of interest will not materially adversely affect us. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable.
