Risk Factors Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain words such as could, expects, may, anticipates, believes, intends, estimates, plans, envisions, seeks and other similar language and are considered forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the operating environment, economies and markets in which we operate. In addition, other written or oral statements which are considered forward-looking may be made by us or others on our behalf. These statements are subject to important risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which are difficult to predict and actual outcomes may be materially different. In particular, the risks described below could cause actual events to differ materially from those contemplated in forward-looking statements. Unless required by applicable securities laws, we do not have any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We have organized our risks into the following categories:  Risks Relating to Our Business;  Risks Relating to Our Liquidity, Financing Arrangements and Capital; and  Risks Relating to Our Prior Restatements and Related Matters. Risks Relating to Our Business We face significant emerging and existing competition, may not be able to maintain our market share and may suffer from competitive pricing practices. We operate in a highly volatile industry that is characterized by industry rationalization and consolidation (both in our competitors and our larger customers), vigorous competition for market share and rapid technological development. Competition is heightened in periods of slow overall market growth. These factors could result in aggressive pricing practices and growing competition from smaller niche companies and established competitors, as well as well-capitalized computer systems and communications companies which, in turn, could separately or together with consolidation in the industry have a material adverse effect on our gross margins. Increased competition could result in price reductions, negatively affecting our operating results and reducing profit margins, and could potentially lead to a loss of market share. The more traditional distinctions between communications equipment providers, computer hardware and software providers and service and solutions companies are blurring with increasing competition between these entities and yet we believe that to be successful going forward it will be increasingly necessary for companies to partner with others in this group in order to offer an integrated and broader based solution. As such distinctions blur, there are new opportunities but increasing uncertainty and risk, including the potential that regulatory decisions or other factors may affect customer spending decisions. Since some of the markets in which we compete are characterized by the potential for rapid growth and, in certain cases, low barriers to entry and rapid technological changes, smaller, specialized companies and start-up ventures are now, or may in the future become, our principal competitors. In particular, we currently, and may in the future, face increased competition from low cost competitors and other aggressive entrants in the market seeking to grow market share. Some of our current and potential competitors may have substantially greater marketing, technical and financial resources, including greater access to the capital markets, than we do. These competitors may have a greater ability to provide customer financing in connection with the sale of products and may be able to accelerate product development or engage in aggressive price reductions or other competitive practices, all of which could give them a competitive advantage over us. Our competitors may enter into business combinations or other relationships to create even more powerful, diversified or aggressive competitors. We may also face competition from the resale of used telecommunications equipment, including our own, by failed, downsized or consolidated high technology enterprises and telecommunications service providers. 18 Table of Contents We may be materially and adversely affected by cautious capital spending, including as a result of current economic uncertainties, or a change in technology focus by our customers, particularly certain key customers. Continued cautiousness in capital spending by service providers and other customers (including certain recent announcements) may affect our revenues and operating results more than we currently expect and may require us to adjust our current business model. We have focused on larger customers in certain markets, which provide a substantial portion of our revenues and margin. Reduced spending, or a loss, reduction or delay in business from one or more of these customers, a significant change in technology focus or a failure to achieve a significant market share with these customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and we could be required to reduce our capital expenditures and investments or take other measures in order to meet our cash requirements. Further, the trend towards the sale of converged networking solutions could also lead to reduced capital spending on multiple networks by our customers as well as other significant technology shifts, including for our legacy products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Rationalization and consolidation among our customers may lead to increased competition and harm our business. Continued rationalization and consolidation among our customers could result in our dependence on a smaller number of customers, purchasing decision delays by the merged companies and our playing a lesser role, or no longer playing a role, in the supply of communications products to the merged companies and downward pressure on pricing of our products. This rationalization and consolidation could also cause increased competition among our customers and pressure on the pricing of their products and services, which could cause further financial difficulties for our customers and result in reduced spending. Some of our customers have experienced financial difficulty and have filed, or may file, for bankruptcy protection or may be acquired by other industry participants. A rationalization of customers could also increase the supply of used communications products for resale, resulting in increased competition and pressure on the pricing for our new products. We operate in highly dynamic and volatile industries. If we are unable to develop new products rapidly and accurately predict, or effectively react to, market opportunities, our ability to compete effectively in our industry, and our sales, market share and customer relationships, could be materially and adversely affected. We operate in highly dynamic and volatile industries. The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards and customer demand, frequent new product introductions and potential for short product life cycles. Our success depends, in substantial part, on the timely and successful introduction of timely, cost competitive, innovative and high quality new products and upgrades to replace our legacy products with declining market demand, as well as cost reductions on current products to address the operational speed, bandwidth, efficiency and cost requirements of our customers. Our success will also depend on our ability to comply with emerging industry standards, to sell products that operate with products of other suppliers, to integrate, simplify and reduce the number of software programs used in our portfolio of products, to anticipate and address emerging market trends, to provide our customers with new revenue-generating opportunities and to compete with technological and product developments carried out by others. The development of new, technologically advanced products, including IP-optimized networking solutions, software products and 4G wireless networks, such as LTE and WiMax to either evolve customers from a CDMA network to a 4G network or implement a new wireless network, is a complex and uncertain process. It requires maintaining financial flexibility to react to changing market conditions and significant R&D commitments, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends along with the timely delivery of new technology. Investments in this environment may result in our R&D and other expenses growing at a faster rate than our revenues, particularly since the initial investment to bring a product to market may be high or market trends could change unexpectedly. We may not be successful in targeting new market opportunities, in developing and commercializing new products in a timely manner or in achieving market acceptance for our new products. If we fail to respond in a timely and effective manner to unanticipated changes in one or more of the technologies affecting telecommunications and data networking or our new products or product enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance, our ability to compete effectively in our industry, and our sales, market share and customer relationships could be materially and adversely affected. 19 Table of Contents Our performance may be materially and adversely affected if our expectations regarding market demand for particular products prove to be wrong. We expect that data communications traffic will grow at a faster rate than the growth expected for voice traffic and that the use of the Internet will continue to increase, and that this in turn will lead to the convergence of data and voice through either upgrades of traditional voice networks to transport large volumes of data traffic or the construction of new networks designed to transport both voice and data traffic. Either approach would require significant capital expenditures by service providers. We also believe that these developments will increase the demand for IP-optimized networking solutions and 4G wireless networks. The demand for IP-optimized networking solutions or 4G wireless networks may be lower than we currently expect or may increase at a slower pace than we currently anticipate. On a regional basis, growth of our revenues from sales of our networking solutions in developing countries, such as China and India, may be less than we anticipate if current customer demand does not translate into future sales, we are unable to establish strategic alliances in key markets or developing countries experience slower growth or fewer deployments of VoIP and wireless data networks than we anticipate. The market may also develop in an unforeseen direction. Certain events, including the commercial availability and actual implementation of new technologies, including 4G wireless networks, or the evolution of other technologies, may occur, which would affect the extent or timing of anticipated market demand, or increase demand for products based on other technologies, or reduce the demand for IP-optimized networking solutions or 4G wireless networks. For example we are seeing an increased demand for LTE as the path to evolve older technologies such as CDMA to 4G wireless networks. Any such change in demand may reduce purchases of our networking solutions by our customers, require increased or more rapid expenditures to develop and market different technologies, or provide market opportunities for our competitors. Certain key and new product evolutions are based on different or competing standards and technologies. There is a risk that the proposals we endorse and pursue may not evolve into an accepted market standard or sufficient active market demand. If our expectations regarding market demand and direction are incorrect, or the rate of development or acceptance of our next-generation solutions such as LTE does not meet market demand and customer expectation, or, if sales of our traditional circuit switching solutions decline more rapidly than we anticipate, or if the rate of decline continues to exceed the rate of growth of our next-generation solutions, it could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to restructure and transform our business. The assumptions underlying these efforts may prove to be inaccurate, or we may fail to achieve the expected benefits from these efforts, we may not successfully manage our costs and we may have to restructure or transform our business again in the future. In order to be successful, we must have a competitive business model which brings innovative products and services to market in a timely way. We continue to restructure and transform our business in response to changes in industry and market conditions and to focus on business simplification, quality improvement, reduce direct and indirect costs, and new revenue growth. We must manage the potentially higher growth areas of our business, which entail higher operational and financial risks, as well as the non-core areas, in order for us to achieve improved results. Our assumptions underlying these actions may not be correct, we may be unable to successfully execute these plans, and even if successfully executed, our actions may not be effective or may not lead to the anticipated benefits, or we may not on an ongoing basis successfully manage our costs. As a result, we may determine that further restructuring or business transformation will be needed, which could result in the need to record further special charges such as costs associated with workforce reductions, and we may be unable to maintain or improve our market competitiveness or profitability. In connection with the transformation of our business, we have made, and will continue to make, judgments as to whether we should further reduce, relocate or otherwise change our workforce. Costs incurred in connection with workforce reduction efforts may be higher than estimated. Furthermore, our workforce efforts may impair our ability to achieve our current or future business objectives. Any further workforce efforts including reductions may not occur on the expected timetable and may result in the recording of additional charges. Further, we have made, and will continue to make, judgments as to whether we should limit investment in, exit, or dispose of certain businesses. Any decision by management to further limit investment in, or exit or dispose of, businesses may result in the recording of additional charges. Any such decisions may not occur on the expected timetable, or at all, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 20 Table of Contents As part of our review of our restructured business, we look at the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets. Future market conditions may indicate these assets are not recoverable based on changes in forecasts of future business performance and the estimated useful life of these assets, and therefore trigger further write-downs of these assets. Further write-downs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Negative developments associated with our suppliers and contract manufacturers, including our reliance on certain suppliers for key optical networking solutions components, and on a sole supplier for the majority of our manufacturing and design functions and consolidation in the industries in which our suppliers operate may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and customer relationships. Our equipment and component suppliers have experienced, and may continue to experience, consolidation in their industry, and at times financial difficulties, which may result in fewer sources of components or products, increased prices and greater exposure relating to the financial stability of our suppliers. A reduction or interruption in component supply or external manufacturing capacity, a significant increase in the price of one or more components, or excessive inventory levels could materially and negatively affect our gross margins and our operating results and could materially damage customer relationships. In particular, we currently rely on certain suppliers for key optical networking solutions components, and our supply of such components could be materially adversely affected by adverse developments in that supply arrangement with these suppliers. If these suppliers are unable to meet their contractual obligations under our supply arrangements and if we are then unable to make alternative arrangements, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and relationships with our customers. As part of the transformation of our supply chain from a vertically integrated manufacturing model to a virtually integrated model, we have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing capacity, and divested associated assets, to contract manufacturers, including an agreement with Flextronics Telecom Systems, Ltd., or Flextronics. As a result, a significant portion of our supply chain is concentrated with Flextronics. In addition, further consolidation in the contract manufacturing industry has had the effect of increasing that concentration. Outsourcing our manufacturing capability to contract manufacturers involves potential challenges in designing and maintaining controls relating to the outsourced operations in an effective and timely manner. We work closely with our suppliers and contract manufacturers to address issues such as cost, quality and timely delivery and to meet increases in customer demand, when needed, and we also manage our internal inventory levels as required. However, we may encounter difficulties, including shortages or interruptions in the supply of quality components and/or products in the future, and we may also encounter difficulties with our concentrated supply chain relationships, which could be compounded by potential consolidation by our key suppliers. Further, certain key elements of our efforts to transform our business require and are reliant on our suppliers meeting their commitments and working cooperatively and effectively on these transformation aspects. A reduction or interruption in component supply or external manufacturing capacity, untimely delivery of products, a significant increase in the price of one or more components, or excessive inventory levels or issues that could arise in our concentrated supply chain relationships or in transitioning between suppliers could materially and negatively affect our gross margins and our operating results and could materially damage customer relationships. We may be required to pay significant penalties or liquidated damages, or our customers may be able to cancel contracts, in the event that we fail to meet contractual obligations including delivery and installation deadlines, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, cash flows and relationships with our customers. Some of our contracts with customers contain delivery and installation timetables, performance criteria and other contractual obligations which, if not met, could result in our having to pay significant penalties or liquidated damages and the termination of the contract. Our ability to meet these contractual obligations is, in part, dependent on us obtaining timely and adequate component parts and products from suppliers and contract manufacturers. Because we do not always have parallel rights against our suppliers, in the event of delays or failures to timely provide component parts and products, such delays or failures could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, cash flows and relationships with our customers. 21 Table of Contents Defects, errors or failures in our products could result in higher costs than we expect and could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our products are highly complex, and some of them can be fully tested only when deployed in telecommunications networks or with other equipment. From time to time, our products have contained undetected defects, errors or failures. The occurrence of defects, errors or failures in our products could result in cancellation of orders and product returns, and the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, loss of sales and increased operating or support costs. Further, our customers or our customers end users could bring legal actions against us, resulting in the diversion of our resources, legal expenses and judgments, fines or other penalties or losses. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We record provisions for estimated costs related to product warranties given to customers to cover defects. These provisions are based in part on historical product failure rates and costs. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Provisions for Product Warranties in the MD&A section of this report. If actual product failure rates or materials replacement, labor or servicing costs are greater than our estimates, our gross margin could be negatively affected. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. As an increasing proportion of our business may be denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our primary currency exposures are to Canadian Dollars, British Pounds and the Euro. These exposures may change over time as we change the geographic mix of our global business and as our business practices evolve. For instance, if we increase our presence in emerging markets, we may see an increase in our exposure to emerging market currencies, such as the Indian Rupee, Brazilian Real and the Chinese Yuan. These currencies may be affected by internal factors and external developments in other countries. Also, our ability to enter into normal course derivative or hedging transactions to mitigate such exposures in the future may be impacted by our credit condition. Significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also engage in economic foreign exchange and interest rate hedging programs. If these programs do not meet the hedge effectiveness designation criteria prescribed by certain accounting rules, or if we choose not to pursue such designation, changes in the fair value of the hedge could result in volatility to our income statement or have a negative effect on our results of operations. If we fail to manage the higher operational and financial risks associated with our international expansion efforts, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We intend to continue to pursue international and emerging market growth opportunities. In many international markets, long-standing relationships between potential customers and their local suppliers and protective regulations, including local content requirements and approvals, create barriers to entry. In addition, pursuing international opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before returns on those investments, if any, are realized, which may result in expenses growing at a faster rate than revenues. Furthermore, those projects and investments could be adversely affected by, among other factors: reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets to new competitors or the introduction of new technologies into those markets; a challenging pricing environment in highly competitive new markets; exchange controls; restrictions on repatriation of cash; nationalization or regulation of local industry; economic, social and political risks; taxation; challenges in staffing and managing international opportunities; and acts of war or terrorism. Difficulties in foreign financial markets and economies and of foreign financial institutions, particularly in emerging markets, could adversely affect demand from customers in the affected countries. An inability to maintain or expand our business in international and emerging markets while balancing the higher operational and financial risks associated with these markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected, an additional valuation allowance may be required for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets. We currently have significant deferred tax assets, which may be used to reduce taxable income in the future. We assess the realization of these deferred tax assets quarterly, and if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion 22 Table of Contents of these assets will not be realized, an income tax valuation allowance is recorded. If market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected, or there is a change to applicable tax rules, future assessments may result in a determination that it is more likely than not that some or all of our net deferred tax assets are not realizable. As a result, we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance for all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are subject to adverse judgments or settlements arising out of disputes regarding intellectual property rights, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Our proprietary technology is very important to our business. We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect that technology. Our business is global, and the extent of that protection varies by jurisdiction. The protection of our proprietary technology may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages. In particular, we may not be successful in obtaining any particular patent. Even if issued, future patents or other intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology. Competitors may misappropriate our intellectual property, disputes as to ownership may arise, and our intellectual property may otherwise fall into the public domain or similar intellectual property may be independently developed by competitors reducing the competitive benefits of our intellectual property. In addition, as part of our business transformation program in 2007, we substantially reduced and began focusing our total overall expenditure on protecting our intellectual property rights with an intention to focus on the key elements of such rights but there is a risk we may not adequately protect key elements. Expenditures on protecting intellectual property in 2008 are expected to be essentially flat from 2007. Additionally, efforts at refocusing the total expenditure on protecting intellectual property rights will continue in 2008. Claims of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation may also be asserted against us, or against our customers in connection with their use of our products or our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or fail to provide significant competitive advantages. We believe that intellectual property licensed from third parties will remain available on commercially reasonable terms in such cases, however there can be no assurance such rights will be available on such terms and an inability to license such rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. An unfavorable outcome in such a claim could require us to cease offering for sale the products that are the subject of such a claim, pay substantial monetary damages to a third party, make ongoing royalty payments to a third party and indemnify our customers. Defense or assertion of claims of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation may require extensive participation by senior management and other key employees and may reduce their time and ability to focus on other aspects of our business. Successful claims of intellectual property infringement or other intellectual property claims against us or our customers, or a failure by us to protect our proprietary technology, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to maintain the integrity of our information systems, our business and future prospects may be harmed. We rely on the security of our information systems, among other things, to protect our proprietary information and information of our customers. If we do not maintain adequate security procedures over our information systems, we may be susceptible to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems to access our proprietary information or that of our customers. Even if we are able to maintain procedures that are adequate to address current security risks, hackers or other unauthorized users may develop new techniques that will enable them to successfully circumvent our current security procedures. The failure to protect our proprietary information could seriously harm our business and future prospects or expose us to claims by our customers, employees or others that we did not adequately protect their proprietary information. Changes in regulation of the Internet or other regulatory changes may affect the manner in which we conduct our business and may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The telecommunications industry is highly regulated by governments around the globe, although market-based reforms are taking place in many countries. Changes in telecommunications regulations, product standards and spectrum availability, 23 Table of Contents or other industry regulation in any country in which we or our customers operate could significantly affect demand for and the costs of our products. For example, regulatory changes could affect our customers capital spending decisions, increase competition among equipment suppliers or increase the costs of selling our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. We are subject to various product content laws and product takeback and recycling requirements that will require full compliance in the coming years. As a result of these laws and requirements, we will incur additional compliance costs. See Environmental Matters in the Legal Proceedings section of this report. Although compliance costs relating to environmental matters have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in the past, they may result in a material adverse effect in the future. If we cannot operate within the scope of those laws and requirements, we could be prohibited from selling certain products in the jurisdictions covered by such laws and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may make strategic acquisitions. If we are not successful in operating or integrating these acquisitions, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. From time to time, we consider acquisitions of businesses that we believe will enhance the expansion of our business and products. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:  the industry may develop in a different direction than anticipated and the technologies we acquire may not prove to be those we need or the business model of acquired companies may become obsolete;  the future valuations of acquired businesses may decrease from the market price we paid for these acquisitions;  the revenues of acquired businesses may not offset increased operating expenses associated with these acquisitions;  potential difficulties in completing in-process research and development projects and delivering high quality products to our customers;  potential difficulties in integrating new products, software, internal controls, businesses and operations in an effective and timely manner or at all;  our customers or customers of the acquired businesses may defer purchase decisions as they evaluate the impact of the acquisitions on our future product strategy;  potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses;  diversion of the attention of our senior management from the operation of our daily business;  entering new markets in which we have limited experience and where competitors may have a stronger market presence;  the potential adverse effect on our cash position as a result of all or a portion of an acquisition purchase price being paid in cash;  potential issuance of equity or equity related securities as a result of all or a portion of an acquisition purchase price being paid with such equity or equity related securities, which could result in the significant dilution of existing equity positions; and  potential assumption of liabilities. If we do not successfully operate and integrate newly acquired businesses appropriately, effectively and in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for IP-optimized network solutions and other advances in technology, as well as on our revenues, gross margins and expenses. Our business may suffer if our strategic alliances are not consummated or are not successful. We have announced a number of strategic alliances with suppliers, developers and members of our industry to facilitate product compatibility, encourage adoption of industry standards or to offer complementary product or service offerings to meet customer needs, including our joint venture with LGE and our alliances with Microsoft and IBM. We believe that cooperation between multiple vendors is critical to the success of our communications solutions for both service providers and enterprises. In some cases, the companies with which we have strategic alliances also compete against us in some of our business areas. If a member of a strategic alliance fails to perform its obligations, if the relationship fails to develop as expected or if the relationship is terminated, we could experience delays in product availability or impairment of our relationships with our customers. Our business may also be adversely affected if our choice of strategic alliance collaborators does not enable us to leverage our existing and future product and service offerings in order to capitalize on expected future market trends (such as convergence in the enterprise market). 24 Table of Contents We may not be able to attract or retain the personnel necessary to achieve our business objectives. Competition for certain key positions and specialized technical and sales personnel in the high-technology industry remains strong. Our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate in a timely manner and retain qualified personnel, particularly in key senior management positions and in our key areas of potential growth. The loss of key managers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are not successful in attracting, recruiting or retaining qualified employees, including members of senior management, we may not have the personnel necessary to achieve our business objectives, including our business transformation initiatives and the implementation of our remedial measures. Our risk management strategy may not be effective or commensurate to the risks we are facing. We maintain global blanket policies of insurance of the types and in the amounts of companies of the same size and in the same industry. We have retained certain self-insurance risks with respect to certain employee benefit programs such as workers compensation, group health insurance, life insurance and other types of insurance. Our risk management programs and claims handling and litigation processes utilize internal professionals and external technical expertise. If this risk management strategy is not effective or is not commensurate to the risks we are facing, these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Risks Relating to Our Liquidity, Financing Arrangements and Capital Cash flow fluctuations may affect our ability to fund our working capital requirements and achieve our business objectives in a timely manner. Additional sources of funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Our working capital requirements and cash flows historically have been, and are expected to continue to be, subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations, depending on such factors as timing and size of capital expenditures, level of sales, timing of deliveries and collection of receivables, inventory levels, customer payment terms, customer financing obligations and supplier terms and conditions. As of December 31, 2007, our primary source of liquidity was cash and we expect this to continue throughout 2008. We cannot be assured that our operations will generate significant cash flow in 2008. If we do not meet our business transformation goals, including those relating to our operating margins, restructuring and working capital programs, our cash flow could be adversely impacted. As discussed below under We are subject to ongoing criminal investigations in the U.S. and Canada, which could require us to pay substantial fines or other penalties or subject us to sanctions that may have material adverse effects on us, any payments we make in connection with any judgments, fines, penalties or settlements in connection with our pending civil litigation and investigations could materially adversely affect our cash position and more generally our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may seek additional funds from liquidity-generating transactions and other sources of external financing (which may include a variety of debt, convertible debt and/or equity financings), but these financings may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may not continue to have access to our $750 support facility with Export Development Canada, or the EDC Support Facility, when and as needed. Our inability to manage cash flow fluctuations resulting from the above factors and the potential reduction or termination of the EDC Support Facility could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our working capital requirements from operating cash flows and other sources of liquidity or to achieve our business objectives in a timely manner. If we are unable to, or decide not to, refinance our existing debt that is coming due in 2008, the amount of cash available to finance our operations and other business activities and our ability to pay any judgments, fines, penalties or settlements, if any, would be significantly reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our high level of debt could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In order to finance our business, we have incurred significant levels of debt. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $4.5 billion of debt. In the future, we may need to obtain additional sources of funding, which may include debt or convertible debt financing. A high level of debt, arduous or restrictive terms and conditions related to accessing certain sources of funding, or any significant reduction in, or access to, the EDC Support Facility, could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt and could materially and adversely affect our ability to: fund the operations of our business; borrow money in the future or access other sources of funding; refinance our 25 Table of Contents existing debt, should we decide to do so; pay interest, or judgments, settlements, fines or other penalties; and maintain our flexibility in planning for or reacting to economic downturns, adverse industry conditions and adverse developments in our business, and our ability to withstand such events. Covenants in the indentures governing certain of our senior notes impose operating and financial restrictions on us, which may prevent us from issuing new debt and from capitalizing on business opportunities. The indentures governing our senior notes contain various restrictive covenants. See Liquidity and Capital Resources in the MD&A section of this report. These and other restrictions in the indentures governing our senior notes may limit our ability to execute our business strategy. A failure to comply with these restrictions could result in an event of default under the senior notes. In such circumstances, it is possible that the holders of our public debt or our lenders would seek to accelerate the maturity of our debt and we and NNL may be unable to meet our respective payment obligations. If this were to occur, we might be forced to seek a waiver or an amendment under the indenture, which could make the terms of these arrangements more onerous for us. Our credit ratings are below investment grade, which may adversely affect our liquidity. NNLs long-term corporate credit rating from Moodys is currently B3 and its preferred share rating is Caa3 and from S&P, it is currently B− and its preferred share rating is CCC−. Both Moodys and S&P have set their respective outlooks at stable. These ratings are below investment grade. These ratings and our current credit condition affect, among other things, our ability to raise debt, access the commercial paper market (which is currently closed to us), engage in alternative financing arrangements, obtain bank financings and our ability and the cost to sell or securitize receivables, obtain customer bid, performance-related and other bonds and contracts and/or enter into normal course derivative or hedging transactions. These factors also affect the terms under which some customers and suppliers are willing to continue to do business with us and the price of our publicly traded securities. If our credit ratings are lowered or rating agencies issue adverse commentaries in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. An increased portion of our cash and cash equivalents may be restricted as cash collateral if we are unable to secure alternative support for certain obligations arising out of our normal course business activities. The EDC Support Facility may not provide all the support we require for certain of our obligations arising out of our normal course of business activities. As of December 31, 2007, there was approximately $146 of outstanding support utilized under the EDC Support Facility, approximately $89 of which was outstanding under the small bond sub-facility. The EDC Support Facility will terminate on December 31, 2011, subject to automatic annual renewal each following year, unless either party provides written notice to the other of its intent to terminate. Individual bonds supported under the EDC Facility currently expire on the fourth anniversary of such individual bond regardless of the termination date of the EDC Support Facility. EDC may also suspend its obligation to issue NNL any additional support if events occur that have a material adverse effect on NNLs business, financial position or results of operations. If we do not have access to sufficient support under the EDC Support Facility, and if we are unable to secure alternative support, an increased portion of our cash and cash equivalents may be restricted as cash collateral, which would reduce our liquidity. An inability of our subsidiaries to provide us with funding in sufficient amounts could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations. We generally depend primarily on loans, dividends or other forms of financing from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations to pay interest and principal on outstanding debt and to pay corporate expenses. If our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or provide us with loans or other forms of financing in sufficient amounts, or if there are any restrictions on the transfer of cash between us and our subsidiaries, including those imposed by foreign governments and commercial limitations on transfers of cash pursuant to our joint ventures commitments, our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations would be adversely affected. We may need to make larger contributions to our defined benefit plans in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and our ability to meet our other obligations. We currently maintain various defined benefit plans in North America and the U.K. covering various categories of employees and retirees, which represent our major retirement plans. In addition, we have smaller retirement plans in other 26 Table of Contents countries. Effective January 1, 2008, accrual for service will no longer continue under our North American defined benefit plans. In November 2006, we reached an agreement with the Trustee of our pension plan in the U.K. that sets the levels of contribution through April 2012. As a result of these North American and U.K. changes, we have greater clarity regarding our contribution levels for the next several years. Our obligations to make contributions to fund benefit obligations under these plans are based on actuarial valuations, which themselves are based on certain assumptions about the long-term operation of the plans, including employee turnover and retirement rates, the performance of the financial markets and interest rates. If future trends differ from the assumptions, the amounts we are obligated to contribute to the plans may increase. If the financial markets perform lower than the assumptions, we may have to make larger contributions in the future than we would otherwise have to make and expenses related to defined benefit plans could increase. Also, if interest rates are lower in the future than we assume they will be, then we could be required to make larger contributions than we would otherwise have to make. Our exposure to our customers credit risk under customer financing arrangements could increase. The competitive environment in which we operate has required us at times to provide significant amounts of medium-term and long-term customer financing. Customer financing arrangements may include financing in connection with the sale of our products and services, funding for certain non-product and service costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services, financing for working capital and equity financing. While we have significantly reduced our customer financing exposure, we may in the future provide customer financing to customers in areas that are strategic to our core business activity. From time to time, certain of our customers may experience financial difficulties and fail to meet their financial obligations. When this occurs, we may incur charges for provisions related to certain trade and customer financing receivables. Any future financial difficulties experienced by any of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and operating results. Our stock price has historically been volatile and any declines in the market price of our publicly traded securities may negatively impact our ability to make future acquisitions, raise capital, issue debt and retain employees. Our publicly traded securities may continue to experience substantial price volatility, including considerable decreases, particularly as a result of variations between our actual or anticipated financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us, including announcements related to management changes, the criminal investigations, the Global Class Action Settlement, the other civil litigation proceedings and related matters. Our credit quality, any equity or equity-related offerings, our operating results and prospects, restatements of previously issued financial statements and any exclusion of our publicly traded securities from any widely followed stock market indices, among other factors, will also affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. The stock markets have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have affected the market price and trading volumes of many technology and telecommunications companies in particular. These fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to raise capital, issue debt, secure customer business, retain employees or make future acquisitions. Such difficulties, as well as general economic and geopolitical conditions, may in turn have a material adverse effect on the market price of our publicly traded securities. The issuance of approximately 62,866,775 Nortel Networks Corporation common shares under the Global Class Action Settlement will result in dilution of existing equity positions and may increase volatility in the market price of Nortel Networks Corporation common shares or our other publicly traded securities. We expect that the remaining settlement shares will be issued commencing in the first half of 2008. The calculations of basic or diluted earnings (loss) per share and the number of Nortel Networks Corporation outstanding common shares do not reflect common shares reserved for issuance under our incentive plans or upon exercise of stock options and common shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of our 4.25% Notes due 2008 or the Convertible Notes. Risks Relating to Our Prior Restatements and Related Matters We are subject to ongoing criminal investigations in the U.S. and Canada, which could require us to pay substantial fines or other penalties or subject us to sanctions that may have material adverse effects on us. We have effected successive restatements of certain prior periods financial results (see our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003). We have also received U.S. federal grand jury subpoenas for the production of certain documents sought in connection with an ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division. Further, a criminal investigation into our 27 Table of Contents financial accounting situation by the Integrated Market Enforcement Team of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is also ongoing. See the Legal Proceedings section of this report. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed or the timing of any other related developments, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. We continue to incur expenses in connection with these investigations and may be required to pay material judgments, fines, penalties or settlements, and we have not taken any reserves for any such payments. The investigations may adversely affect our ability to obtain, or increase the cost of obtaining, directors and officers liability insurance and other types of insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the findings and outcomes of the criminal investigations and our settlements with the OSC and SEC in May 2007 and October 2007, respectively, may adversely affect the course of the remaining civil litigation against us. The Global Class Action Settlement requires us to pay a substantial cash amount and will result in a significant dilution of existing equity positions. We have entered into agreements to settle the U.S. class actions and all but one of the related Canadian actions. In December 2006 and January 2007, the Global Class Action Settlement was approved by all of the courts in New York, Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec. Under the terms of the Global Class Action Settlement, we agreed to pay $575, plus applicable accrued interest, in cash and will issue approximately 62,866,775 Nortel Networks Corporation common shares (representing approximately 14.5% of Nortel Networks Corporation common shares outstanding as of February 7, 2006), to the plaintiffs, and will contribute to the plaintiffs one-half of any recovery from our ongoing litigation against certain of our former senior officers who were terminated for cause in 2004, which seeks the return of payments made to them in 2003 under our bonus plan. The effective date of the Global Class Action Settlement was March 20, 2007, on which date the number of shares issuable in connection with the equity component was fixed. The administration of the settlement continues to be a complex and lengthy process. Although we cannot predict how long the process will take, approximately 4% of the settlement shares have been issued, and we currently expect the issuance of the balance to commence in the first half of 2008. Our insurers agreed to pay $229 towards the settlement and we agreed with the insurers to certain indemnification obligations. While we believe that these indemnification obligations would be unlikely to materially increase our total payment obligations under the Global Class Action Settlement, any such indemnification payments could be material and would not reduce the amounts payable by us. The equity component of the Global Class Action Settlement will result in a dilution of existing equity positions, could contribute to volatility in the market price of Nortel Networks Corporation common shares and could materially and adversely impact future financings with equity or equity-related securities. We are subject to additional pending civil litigation actions, which are not encompassed by the Global Class Action Settlement and which, if decided against us or as a result of settlement, could require us to pay significant judgments or settlements and could result in the dilution of existing equity positions, and we cannot predict the timing of developments in these matters. In addition to the shareholder class actions encompassed by the Global Class Action Settlement and litigation in the ordinary course of business, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to class actions, other securities litigation and other actions arising in relation to our accounting restatements. See the Legal Proceedings section of this report. This litigation is, and any such additional litigation could be, time consuming and expensive and could distract our executive team from the conduct of our daily business. The adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our ability to favorably resolve other lawsuits and on our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, the resolution of those matters may require us to issue equity or equity-related securities, which could potentially result in the significant dilution of existing equity positions.
