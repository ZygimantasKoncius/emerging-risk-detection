D. Risk Factors in this annual report. We caution you that our businesses and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. A. Operating Results Overview We operate a platform that offers mobile and PC applications for our users and global content distribution channels for our customers, both of which are powered by our proprietary cloud-based data analytics engines. Our mission critical applications, including Clean Master, CM Security, Battery Doctor and Duba Anti-virus, help make the internet and mobile experience speedier, simpler and safer for users worldwide. Although substantially all of our applications are free to our users, our large user base presents monetization opportunities for us and our customers. We generate revenues from our online marketing services primarily by referring user traffic and selling advertisements on our mobile and PC platforms. We generated 73.8%, 81.7% and 75.0% of our revenues from online marketing services in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. We also generate revenues by providing internet value-added services, currently mainly from online games. We have achieved significant growth in recent years. Our revenues increased from RMB287.9 million in 2012 to RMB749.9 million in 2013, representing a 160.5% growth, and further to RMB1,763.6 million (US$284.2 million) in 2014, representing a 135.2% growth. Our net income attributable to Cheetah Mobile shareholders increased from RMB9.8 million in 2012 to RMB62.0 million in 2013, representing a 530.0% increase, and further increased by 9.6% to RMB67.9 million (US$11.0 million) in 2014. We believe mobile presents massive opportunities and we have made significant investments in mobile internet to capitalize on these opportunities. Our mobile user base has grown rapidly since we launched our first mobile application, Battery Doctor, in July 2011. Our mobile applications attracted 395.4 million monthly active users in December 2014. Our mobile strategy has been focusing on the development of applications for the Android platform. As of December 31, 2014, we have created 32 core mobile applications for Android, compared to 15 for iOS. Accordingly, the popularity of the Android ecosystem and the use of Android devices have, and will continue to have, material impacts on our overall results of operations. We are still in the early stage of monetizing our mobile applications and the revenues generated from our mobile applications accounted for only approximately 2.2%, 7.4% and 26.4% of our total revenues in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. 85 Table of Contents Our business has rapidly expanded internationally since we released our Clean Master overseas version in September 2012. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 68.8% of our mobile monthly active users were from overseas markets, mostly the United States, Asia (excluding China) and Europe, compared to 53.2% as of December 31, 2013. Since we began to monetize our overseas operations in the second quarter of 2014, overseas revenues have increased significantly to 23.6% of our total revenues and 62.6% of our mobile revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014. Overseas revenues accounted for 12.6% of our total revenues and 47.7% of our mobile revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. As we continue to deepen our global penetration and increase the level of monetization in overseas markets, we expect that our overseas revenues will continue to increase and become a major growth driver for both our mobile and total revenues. We have invested heavily in research and development and selling and marketing to grow our mobile business. Operating expenses as a percentage of our revenues have increased from 68.9% in 2013 to 72.4% in 2014. In 2015, we expect to further increase our investments in marketing spending to grow our user base, and in the expansion of our mobile business team to develop mobile applications and expand our mobile business in the global market. We expect our operating expenses will increase in absolute amount and as a percentage of revenues in 2015. We believe that our investments will contribute to value creation in the long term. Selected Statement of Operations Items Revenues We generate revenues from online marketing services, internet value-added services, or IVAS, and internet security services and others. The following table sets forth the principal components of our revenues by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods presented. Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014 RMB % of Revenues RMB % of Revenues RMB US$ % of Revenues (in thousands, except percentages) Online marketing services 212,443 73.8 612,565 81.7 1,322,612 213,166 75.0 IVAS 2,354 0.8 83,155 11.1 400,671 64,576 22.7 Internet security services and others 73,130 25.4 54,191 7.2 40,296 6,495 2.3 Revenues 287,927 100.0 749,911 100.0 1,763,579 284,237 100.0 Online Marketing Services Revenues from our online marketing services accounted for 73.8%, 81.7% and 75.0% of our revenues in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. We generate online marketing revenues primarily by referring user traffic and selling advertisements on our mobile and PC platforms. The fee arrangements generally include cost per sale, cost per click, cost per time or cost per installation for actions that originate from our platform. We believe that the most significant factors affecting revenues from online marketing include: · User base and user engagement. We believe a large, loyal and engaged user base would help us retain existing customers and attract more customers seeking online marketing services and at the same time gives us more pricing power. It also results in more user impressions, clicks, sales or other actions that generate more fees for performance-based marketing. In particular, a large and engaged mobile user base is crucial for the long-term growth of our online marketing services. We plan to increase our spending on marketing activities to further grow our global mobile user base. 86 Table of Contents · Revenue sharing and fee arrangements with our significant customers. A small number of customers have contributed a majority of our online marketing service revenues. Changes in the revenue sharing or fee arrangements with these significant customers may materially affect our online marketing services revenues. For example, changes from pay per click to pay per sale arrangements may result in a smaller percentage of revenue-generating traffic. Likewise, changes in the fee rate we receive per click or per sale may affect our online marketing services revenues. Although changes in the revenue sharing and fee arrangements with our individual customer may affect our revenues positively or negatively, our array of choices helps to increase our overall customer base and our ability to tailor fee arrangements to the needs of our customers. · Ability to increase the number of customers. We had over 950 customers in 2014, including business partners such as Facebook and Google. Our ability to increase our number of customers depends on whether we can provide integrated marketing services and help the customers more precisely reach their targeted audience, the effectiveness of our direct sales efforts, our ability to successfully acquire additional customer base through acquisition of complementary businesses, and our ability to increase our range of cooperation with existing business partners such as Facebook and Google. · Optimal utilization of advertising inventory. Certain categories of customers are willing to offer higher rates for our online marketing services due to the high return on investment they can achieve on our platform. Our ability to source high quality customers within the appropriate categories that our users are interested in and our ability to optimize the allocation of our advertising inventory to these customers can help improve our online marketing services revenues. IVAS Revenues from IVAS accounted for 0.8%, 11.1% and 22.7% of our revenues in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. IVAS in these periods mainly include publishing online games. We believe that the most significant factors affecting our IVAS revenues include: · Popularity of games on our platform. We began publishing games in the third quarter of 2012 and had more than 840 games in our game centers as of December 31, 2014 . Our revenues from game publishing depend on our ability to select and publish popular and engaging games. The popularity of the games we publish directly affects the number of users we attract and the revenues generated from such games. · Game publishing arrangements. We have two types of game publishing arrangements. Under a joint operating arrangement, we jointly operate games with game developers and publishers without paying license fees or incurring significant promotional expenses. We share user payments with game developers and publishers. As of December 31, 2014, most of the games on our platform were under joint operating arrangements. Under an exclusive publishing arrangement, we pay royalty fees and upfront license fees to developers, share a portion of user payments with certain publishers, and promote and operate the games at our own costs. The popularity of the games has a larger impact in revenues for exclusive publishing arrangement as we bear higher risks and potentially receive higher rewards under this arrangement. 87 Table of Contents · Number of paying users for games. Games published on our platform are free to play and we generate revenues from users purchase of in-game virtual items. Since we started publishing games, the number of monthly paying users has grown significantly. We calculate the number of paying users during a given period as the cumulative number of paying user accounts that have purchased virtual items at least once during the relevant period. We expect the number of monthly paying users to continue to grow as we publish more popular games, especially mobile games, on our platform and further strengthen our game distribution capabilities through our mobile applications. · Other services. Capitalizing on our large user base, we plan to continue to launch new value added services for new revenue opportunities on our platform. Internet Security Services and Others Revenues from internet security services and others accounted for 25.4%, 7.2% and 2.3% of our revenues in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Internet security services and others revenues mainly include subscription services such as game acceleration and instant data recovery for our paying members, and license fees from Kingsoft Japan, one of Kingsoft Corporations subsidiaries. In 2012 and 2013, this revenue item also included revenues from enterprise security services that were subsequently transferred from our company to an equity investee. We expect revenues from internet security services to decline as we continue to remodel our business into a mobile-oriented platform. Cost of Revenues Historically, cost of revenues consisted primarily of bandwidth costs, server custody fees and depreciation of servers and other equipment (collectively, bandwidth and IDC costs), personnel costs, content and channel costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and VAT, business tax, and related surcharges. Bandwidth and IDC costs consist of fees that we pay to telecommunication carriers and other service providers for hosting our servers at their internet data centers and purchasing bandwidth as well as depreciation of our servers and other equipment that are directly related to our business operations and technical support. We expect our bandwidth and IDC costs to increase as our user traffic continues to grow. Personnel costs include salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation, for our employees involved in the operation of our game publishing business and maintenance of servers. We expect personnel costs to increase as we hire additional operational employees in line with the expansion of our business. Content and channel costs consist primarily of the fees shared by the third-party game developers, commission fees paid to distribution platforms and payment channels, and amortization of license fees paid for exclusively licensed games. Amortization of acquired intangible assets primarily represents amortization of intangible assets through acquisitions or business combinations. Going forward, as we continue to (i) develop our game publishing services, (ii) conduct business combinations and acquisitions, and (iii) increase cooperation with advertising publishers, we expect that the content and channel costs associated with game publishing business, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and the share of revenues paid to advertising publishers will become more significant components of our cost of revenues and our gross margin will decrease accordingly. 88 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of (i) research and development expenses, (ii) selling and marketing expenses and (iii) general and administrative expenses. The following table sets forth the components of our operating expenses for the periods indicated, both in absolute amounts and as percentages of our revenues. Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014 RMB % of Revenues RMB % of Revenues RMB US$ % of Revenues (in thousands, except percentages) Operating expenses: Research and development 114,329 39.7 217,846 29.0 436,840 70,406 24.8 Selling and marketing 57,167 19.9 201,504 26.9 580,610 93,577 32.9 General and administrative 34,408 12.0 97,817 13.0 260,047 41,912 14.7 Total operating expenses 205,904 71.6 517,167 68.9 1,277,497 205,895 72.4 Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation expenses, for our research and development employees. These expenditures are generally expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to expand our research and development team to develop better applications for our users and a more sophisticated mobile advertising platform. Selling and Marketing Expenses. Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation expenses, related to personnel involved in our selling and marketing efforts and general marketing and promotion expenses. We expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase significantly as we plan to expand our mobile business and deepen our global penetration. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation expenses, related to our general and administrative personnel, professional service fees, and other administrative expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as our business grows and as we incur increased expenses related to complying with our reporting obligations under the U.S. securities laws as a public company. Taxation Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or after execution brought within the jurisdiction of, the Cayman Islands. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands. Additionally, upon payments of dividends by our company to its shareholders, no Cayman Islands withholding tax will be imposed. British Virgin Islands. A BVI business company subject to the provisions of the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (as amended) is exempt from all provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance of the BVI (including with respect to all dividends, interests, rents, royalties, compensation and other amounts payable by such company to persons who are not persons resident in the BVI). 89 Table of Contents Capital gains realized with respect to any shares, debt obligations or other securities of a company by persons who are not persons resident in the BVI are also exempt from all provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance of the BVI. No estate, inheritance, succession or gift tax, rate, duty, levy or other charge is payable by persons who are not persons resident in the BVI with respect to any shares, debt obligations or other securities of a company, save for interest payable to or for the benefit of an individual resident in the European Union. United States. Cheetah Mobile America was incorporated in the United States and is subject to federal income tax rate of 35% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively. No provision for federal income tax has been made in the consolidated financial statements as it had no assessable profits for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014. Hong Kong. Cheetah Technology, Zoom Interactive and Hong Kong Youloft Technology Limited, or Youloft, were incorporated in Hong Kong and are subject to Hong Kong profits tax at a rate of 16.5%. No provision for Hong Kong profits tax has been made for Cheetah Technology as it had no assessable profits for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2013, Cheetah Technology was in a gain position subject to profits tax at a rate of 16.5%. Zoom Interactive and Youloft were in a gain position subject to profits tax at a rate of 16.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. PRC. Enterprise income tax. Our subsidiaries, VIEs and a VIEs subsidiary are subject to the statutory rate of 25% in accordance with the EIT Law, with exceptions for certain preferential tax treatments. Under relevant government policies, enterprises qualified as new software enterprise are entitled to a two-year exemption and three-year 50% reduction on enterprise income tax commencing from the first profit-making year. Enterprises qualified as high and new technology enterprise are entitled to a preferential rate of 15%. A few of our PRC subsidiaries or VIEs, including Beijing Security, Beike Internet, Beijing Network and Conew Network, are qualified as new software enterprise and some of our other PRC subsidiaries or VIEs, including Zhuhai Juntian, Beijing Security, Beike Internet, Beijing Network and Conew Network, have obtained the high and new technology enterprise certificate. Zhuhai Juntian was eligible for a preferential tax rate of 12.5%, 12.5% and 15% for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Beijing Security was eligible for a preferential tax rate of 12.5% from 2012 to 2014. Each of Beike Internet, Beijing Network and Conew Network was in a loss position for the year ended December 31, 2012, and obtained a new software enterprise certificate in 2013. As a result, Beike Internet and Conew Network were eligible for a 0% preferential tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014. Beijing Network was still in a loss position for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, and will be eligible for a 0% preferential tax rate commencing from its first profit-making year. Our remaining VIEs and a VIEs subsidiary were subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Withholding tax. Under the EIT Law and its implementation rules, dividends, interests, rent or royalties payable by a foreign-invested enterprise, such as our PRC subsidiaries, to any of its non-resident enterprise investors, and proceeds from any such non-resident enterprise investors disposition of assets (after deducting the net value of such assets) shall be subject to 10% EIT, namely withholding tax, unless non-resident enterprise investors jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty or arrangements with China that provides for a reduced withholding tax rate or an exemption from withholding tax. The Cayman Islands, where our company is incorporated, and the British Virgin Islands, where our subsidiary Conew.com Corporation was incorporated, do not have such tax treaties with China. Our U.S. subsidiary is not an immediate holding company of any of our PRC subsidiaries. Under the Arrangement Between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, the dividend withholding tax rate may be reduced to 5%, if a Hong Kong resident enterprise that receives a dividend is considered a non-PRC tax resident enterprise and holds at least 25% of the equity interests in the PRC enterprise distributing the dividends, subject to approval of the PRC local tax authority. However, if the Hong Kong resident enterprise is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under applicable PRC tax regulations, such dividends may remain subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10%. Accordingly, Cheetah Technology Corporation Limited may be able to enjoy the 5% withholding tax rate for the dividends it receives from our PRC subsidiaries if it satisfies the relevant conditions under tax rules and regulations, and obtains the approvals as required. 90 Table of Contents PRC business tax and VAT. On January 1, 2012, the Chinese State Council officially launched a pilot VAT reform program, or Pilot Program, applicable to businesses in selected industries. Businesses in the Pilot Program would pay VAT instead of business tax. The Pilot Program imposes VAT in lieu of business tax for certain modern service industries in certain regions and eventually expands to nation-wide in August 2013. According to the implementation circulars released by the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation on the Pilot Program, the modern service industries include industries involving the leasing of tangible movable property, research and development and technical services, information technology services, cultural and creative services, logistics and ancillary services, certification and consulting services, and radio and television services. With respect to all of our PRC entities for the period prior to the implementation of the Pilot Program, revenues from online marketing services, IVAS and subscription of internet security services were subject to a 5% PRC business tax. All of our entities were subject to the Pilot Program as of December 31, 2014, or specifically, VAT of 6% in lieu of business tax for online marketing services, IVAS and subscription of internet security services that are deemed by the relevant tax authorities to be within the pilot industries. In addition, cultural business construction fee is imposed at the rate of 3% on revenues derived from our online marketing services. With respect to revenues from sales of goods, including sales of software products, licensing software without transferring its copyright and sales of other goods, they are still subject to a 17% VAT pursuant to Chinese tax law. In addition, sales of self-developed software products or license fees from self-developed software are entitled to a VAT refund with respect to the tax payment over a tax rate of 3%. With the adoption of the Pilot Program, our revenues subject to VAT payable on goods sold or taxable services provided by a general VAT taxpayer for a taxable period is the net balance of the output VAT for the period after crediting the input VAT for the period. Hence, the amount of VAT payable does not result directly from output VAT generated from goods sold or taxable services provided. Therefore, we have adopted the net presentation of VAT. Results of Operations The following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated. The period-to-period comparisons of results of operations should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. 91 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014 RMB RMB RMB US$ (In thousands) Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income Data: Revenues 287,927 749,911 1,763,579 284,237 Online marketing services 212,443 612,565 1,322,612 213,166 IVAS 2,354 83,155 400,671 64,576 Internet security services and others 73,130 54,191 40,296 6,495 Cost of revenues (1) (71,560 ) (140,526 ) (403,412 ) (65,018 ) Gross profit 216,367 609,385 1,360,167 219,219 Operating expenses: Research and development (1) (114,329 ) (217,846 ) (436,840 ) (70,406 ) Selling and marketing (1) (57,167 ) (201,504 ) (580,610 ) (93,577 ) General and administrative (1) (34,408 ) (97,817 ) (260,047 ) (41,912 ) Total operating expenses (205,904 ) (517,167 ) (1,277,497 ) (205,895 ) Operating profit 10,463 92,218 82,670 13,324 Other income (expenses): Interest income 3,263 7,077 28,216 4,548 Changes in fair value of redemption right granted to a noncontrolling shareholder  11,146 3,576 576 Changes in fair value of contingent considerations (297 ) (1,067 ) (13,749 ) (2,216 ) Changes in fair value of put options granted to employees   799 129 Foreign exchange gain, net 47 920 16 3 Impairment loss of available-for-sale securities   (8,664 ) (1,397 ) Other income, net 1,283 2,243 3,487 562 Losses from equity method investments  (1,849 ) (5,447 ) (878 ) Income before taxes 14,759 110,688 90,904 14,651 Income tax expenses (4,915 ) (48,670 ) (23,993 ) (3,867 ) Net income 9,844 62,018 66,911 10,784 Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests   (1,030 ) (166 ) Net income attributable to Cheetah Mobile Inc. 9,844 62,018 67,941 10,950 (1) The amount of share-based compensation expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 is as follows: As of December 31, 2012 2013 2014 RMB RMB RMB US$ (In thousands) Cost of revenues 21 10 1,393 225 Research and development expenses 6,663 14,520 51,176 8,248 Selling and marketing expenses 609 2,835 7,407 1,194 General and administrative expenses 12,994 20,031 113,298 18,260 Total 20,287 37,396 173,274 27,927 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 Revenues. Our revenues increased by 135.2% from RMB749.9 million in 2013 to RMB1,763.6 million (US$284.2 million) in 2014. This increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues from online marketing services and IVAS, partially offset by decrease in internet security services and others. Our mobile revenues increased from RMB55.3 million in 2013 to RMB465.0 million (US$74.9 million) in 2014, resulting from the increased demand for our mobile advertising services in China and overseas markets, our expanded mobile user base and the growth of our mobile game publishing business. 92 Table of Contents Online marketing services. Revenues from online marketing services increased by 115.9% from RMB612.6 million in 2013 to RMB1,322.6 million (US$213.2 million) in 2014. This increase was primarily due to the growth of our user traffic and increased monetization of our PC platform. The increase in revenues from online marketing services was also due to a significant growth of our mobile advertising revenues from RMB40.0 million in 2013 to RMB313.0 million (US$50.4 million) in 2014, driven by the increased acceptance of our mobile advertising services in China and overseas markets, and increased mobile monetization. IVAS. Revenues from IVAS was RMB400.7 million (US$64.6 million) in 2014, a 381.8% increase from RMB83.2 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of mobile and PC games that we published, and an increase in the number of monthly paying users from 2013 to 2014. Internet security services and others. Revenues from internet security services and others decreased by 25.6% from RMB54.2 million in 2013 to RMB40.3 million (US$6.5 million) in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to our ceasing to promote subscriptions services to paying users in a strategic reorientation, resulting in a decrease in the number of paying customers. Cost of revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 187.1% from RMB140.5 million in 2013 to RMB403.4 million (US$65.0 million) in 2014. The increase in our cost of revenues was mainly due to increased content and channel costs associated with the growth of our mobile game business, higher costs of value-added tax associated with the growth of our revenues, higher bandwidth and IDC costs due to increased user traffic, and higher amortization costs due to newly acquired intangible assets related to business acquisitions. Gross profit. As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit increased by 123.2% from RMB609.4 million in 2013 to RMB1,360.2 million (US$219.2 million) in 2014. Gross margin. Our gross margin decreased from 81.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 77.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased revenue contribution from mobile games publishing, which has a lower margin, as well as an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses. Our operating expenses increased by 147.0% from RMB517.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to RMB1,277.5 million (US$205.9 million) for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increases in research and development expenses, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses. Our research and development expenses increased by 100.5% from RMB217.8 million in 2013 to RMB436.8 million (US$70.4 million) in 2014. This increase was primarily due to our expanded team of research and development personnel, increasing from 842 as of December 31, 2013 to 1,268 as of December 31, 2014 mainly to further develop our mobile applications. The increase was also due to an increase in share-based compensation expenses included in our research and development expenses from RMB14.5 million in 2013 to RMB51.2 million (US$8.2 million) in 2014. Selling and marketing expenses. Our selling and marketing expenses increased by 188.1% from RMB201.5 million in 2013 to RMB580.6 million (US$93.6 million) in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increased spending on marketing and promotional activities to expand our global mobile user base. The increase was also due to our expanded team of sales and marketing personnel, which increased from 81 as of December 31, 2013 to 221 as of December 31, 2014 mainly to further enhance our mobile monetization capabilities and global sales efforts. 93 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses increased by 165.9% from RMB97.8 million in 2013 to RMB260.0 million (US$41.9 million) in 2014. This increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expenses from RMB20.0 million in 2013 to RMB113.3 million (US$18.3 million) in 2014, an increase in professional service fees, and an increase in the headcount of general and administrative personnel from 79 as of December 31, 2013 to 153 as of December 31, 2014. Operating profit. As a result of the foregoing, our operating profit decreased from RMB92.2 million in 2013 to RMB82.7 million (US$13.3 million) in 2014. Operating margin. Our operating margin decreased from 12.3% in 2013 to 4.7% in 2014 primarily due to increases in share-based compensation expenses, selling and marketing expenses and headcount increase. Income tax expense. Our income tax expense decreased from RMB48.7 million in 2013 to RMB24.0 million (US$3.9 million) in 2014, primarily due to preferential tax treatment to a number of our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs, and a slowdown in the increase of the unremitted retained earnings and reserves of our VIEs in 2014, resulting in a decrease in outside basis difference on investment in our VIEs. Net income attributable to Cheetah Mobile Shareholders. As a result of the foregoing, our net income attributable to Cheetah Mobile shareholders increased from RMB62.0 million in 2013 to RMB67.9 million (US$11.0 million) in 2014. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 Revenues. Our revenues increased by 160.5% from RMB287.9 million in 2012 to RMB749.9 million in 2013. This increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues from online marketing services and IVAS, partially offset by decrease in internet security services and others. Our revenues generated from our mobile business increased from RMB6.3 million in 2012 to RMB55.3 million in 2013, resulted from the increased acceptance of our mobile advertising services and the growth of our mobile gaming services. Online marketing services. Revenues from online marketing services increased by 188.3% from RMB212.4 million 2012 to RMB612.6 million in 2013. This increase was mainly driven by an increase in online marketing revenues from our top ten customers from RMB171.4 million in 2012 to RMB476.2 million in 2013, and to a lesser extent, an increase in the total number of our online marketing customers from 199 in 2012 to 387 in 2013. The significant increase in revenues from our top ten customers was primarily due to the significant growth of our user traffic, our broader and deeper cooperation with these customers, and the resulting more favorable pricing terms from these customers. In addition, we began to generate mobile advertising revenues in 2012 and 2013 was the first full year in which we had mobile advertising revenues. IVAS. Revenues from IVAS was RMB83.2 million in 2013, a significant increase from RMB2.4 million in 2012. We launched our game publishing business in the third quarter of 2012 and significantly increased the number of mobile and PC games we published in 2013. As a result, the number of our monthly paying users grew to 50,115 in December 2013. Internet security services and others. Revenues from internet security services and others decreased by 25.9% from RMB73.1 million in 2012 to RMB54.2 million in 2013. This decrease was primarily due to our strategic reorientation to stop promoting subscriptions services to paying users, resulting in a decrease in the number of paying customers. 94 Table of Contents Cost of revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 96.4% from RMB71.6 million in 2012 to RMB140.5 million in 2013. The increase in our cost of revenues was mainly due to an increase in taxes and surcharges, bandwidth and IDC costs and personnel costs. Our bandwidth and IDC costs increased as a result of our growing user traffic and our personnel costs increased primarily due to increased headcount and level of compensation. Gross profit. Our gross profit increased by 181.6% from RMB216.4 million in 2012 to RMB609.4 million in 2013. Gross margin. Our gross margin was 75.1% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 81.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating expenses. Our operating expenses increased by 151.2% from RMB205.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 to RMB517.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increase in research and development expenses, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses. Our research and development expenses increased by 90.5% from RMB114.3 million in 2012 to RMB217.8 million in 2013. This increase was primarily due to our expanded team of research and development personnel, increasing from 506 as of December 31, 2012 to 842 as of December 31, 2013 mainly to further develop our mobile business and cloud-based analytics engines. The increase is also due to increased salary levels and investments in our mobile products business. Our research and development expenses included share-based compensation expenses of RMB6.7 million and RMB14.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Selling and marketing expenses. Our selling and marketing expenses increased from RMB57.2 million in 2012 to RMB201.5 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to expenses incurred in further promoting our mobile applications, in particular Clean Master and Battery Doctor and our brand awareness. General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses increased by 184.3% from RMB34.4 million in 2012 to RMB97.8 million in 2013. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our general and administrative staff, from 40 as of December 31, 2012 to 79 as of December 31, 2013, increased salary levels and an increase in professional service fees. Our general and administrative expenses included share-based compensation expenses of RMB13.0 million and RMB20.0 million in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Operating profit. Our operating profit increased from RMB10.5 million in 2012 to RMB92.2 million in 2013. Operating margin. Our operating margin increased from 3.6% in 2012 to 12.3% in 2013. Income tax expense. Our income tax expense increased from RMB4.9 million in 2012 to RMB48.7 million in 2013, primarily as a result of increased income and the outside basis difference arising from unremitted retained earnings and reserves of our VIEs. Net income attributable to Cheetah Mobile Shareholders. As a result of the foregoing, our net income attributable to Cheetah Mobile shareholders increased from RMB9.8 million in 2012 to RMB62.0 million in 2013. 95 Table of Contents Inflation Since our inception, inflation in China has not materially impacted our results of operations. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the consumer price index in China increased by 2.6%, 2.5% and 1.5% in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Although we have not in the past been materially affected by inflation since our inception, we can provide no assurance that we will not be affected in the future by higher rates of inflation in China or elsewhere in the world. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our estimates. An accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time such estimate is made and if different accounting estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognition We generate revenues primarily through online marketing services, internet value-added services, and internet security services and others. We recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Online marketing services We generate revenues from online marketing services primarily by referring user traffic and selling advertisements on our mobile and PC platforms. Online marketing services contributed 73.8%, 81.7% and 75.0% of our revenues in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. The online marketing services are provided through our online platform, such as text links, contextual native ads, banners, and other forms of graphical advertisement which link to our customers websites or mobile applications. We have two general pricing models for advertising links: cost over a time period and cost for performance basis (including cost per sale, cost per click or cost per installation). For advertising contracts over a time period, we generally recognize revenues ratably over the period the advertising is provided. For contracts that are charged on the cost for performance basis, we charge an agreed-upon fee to our customers determined based on the effectiveness of advertising links, which is typically measured by user registrations, clicks, transactions, downloads and other actions originating from our online platform. Online marketing services revenue charged on the cost for performance basis is generally recognized upon receiving monthly statements from our customers either in the current month or in the following month in which the service is provided. We also direct search traffic to search engines through our default search boxes placed on our online platform, and earn a pre-determined fee from our search engine customers based on the number of searches originating from our online platform. Search revenues are recognized upon receiving monthly confirmations from our search engine customers confirming the amount for traffic in the month in which the service is provided. 96 Table of Contents We occasionally engage in nonmonetary transactions to allow one of our shareholders to advertise and co-market our mobile and PC applications with a related partys software products. Revenues and expenses are recognized at fair value when such fair value of the services surrendered in the transaction is determinable based on our own historical practice of receiving cash, marketable securities, or other consideration that is readily convertible to a known amount of cash for similar services from customers unrelated to the counterparty in the barter transaction. No revenues or expenses are recognized if the fair value of the nonmonetary transactions is not determinable. In addition, we provide advertising agency services by arranging advertisers to purchase various advertisement products from certain online network, primarily Facebook and Google AdWords. We receive from the online network performance-based commissions, which are determined based on a pre-specified percentage of the payment by the advertisers for the online networks various advertisement products. We act as an agent in the advertising agency arrangement as we are neither the primary obligor to provide advertisement product nor to assume inventory risk. Revenue from advertising agency services is recognized on a net basis when the advertisement products are delivered by the online network. IVAS We enter into agreements with online and mobile game developers to provide online and mobile distribution and payment collection services, in order for game players to purchase and recharge virtual currencies used in the online and mobile games. All games are developed and hosted by game developers, and accessed by game players through links on our online, mobile platform or third-party mobile platforms. The payment collection services are mainly provided through third-party professional payment and settlement institutions. We generally charge commission as a percentage of the gross proceeds or collection amount from the settlement institutions, and pay the remaining proceeds to the game developers. We act as an agent to the game developers in these arrangements and therefore recognize revenue net of remittances to the developer as they are considered the primary obligor. We estimate revenues based on our internal system, which is confirmed with the respective settlement institutions, and recognized such revenues periodically when accepted by the game developer. For certain mobile games that we believe we act as the principal in the arrangements, we are considered the primary obligor and take fulfillment responsibilities of game operations, including determining distribution and promotion, providing customer services, setting up game and services specifications, and pricing of in-game virtual currencies and virtual items. We record such mobile game revenues on a gross basis. Commission fees paid to the third-party mobile platform and royalty fees paid to third party game developers are recorded as cost of revenues. We have determined that an implied obligation exists to the paying players over their estimated average playing life, and accordingly, recognize the revenues ratably over the estimated average paying player life, i.e. from the time when the players accounts are first recharged with in-game virtual currency to when the players becoming inactive when all other revenue recognition criteria are met. The average paying player life is estimated based on the historical data of paying players behavior. While we believe the estimate to be reasonable based on available game player information, we may revise such estimates in the future as more game data become available and playing patterns of the paying players of the game change. Any adjustments arising from changes in the estimates of the average paying player life are applied prospectively on the basis that such changes are caused by new information indicating a change in game player behavior patterns. Purchases of in-game currency are not refundable after they have been sold. In addition, we receive online lottery purchase orders from the end users through our website or mobile application and process the orders either with other entities or individuals who are authorized agents of lottery sales offices established by provincial governments, or Authorized Distributors. We receive service fees from the Authorized Distributors based on the pre-determined rate and the total amount of the processed orders. Upon fulfilling our service obligations to the Authorized Distributors, we record the revenue on a net basis because we act as an agent of the Authorized Distributors in the distribution and administration of the lottery products. Internet security services and others We market and distribute our off-the-shelf anti-virus security solutions to enterprise and individual users. The enterprise solutions are distributed through re-sellers. The individual solutions are directly sold to the individual end-users. 97 Table of Contents Upon the customers initial purchase of the enterprise solutions, the arrangements include multiple elements, generally comprising of software and post-contract customer services, or PCS. When vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of the fair value of the PCS exists, we allocate and defer revenues for the PCS based on its fair value, and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred as software license revenues. When VSOE of the fair value of the PCS does not exist, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the PCS period. The arrangement fee of the PCS purchased on a stand-alone basis is recognized into revenues ratably over the PCS period. The software, including unspecified upgrades, for the individual solutions are provided to users free of charge via downloads from our online platform at any time. We also provide the individual users the option to purchase additional value added services, which are non-essential to the functionality of the software, either concurrent with the download of software, or separately as a renewal. The value added services are provided over the period of time as determined and purchased by the respective users. The fees for value-added services are recognized into revenues ratably over the term of such services. We occasionally engage in nonmonetary transactions to provide free internet security services to the major Chinese internet companies to promote a more secured internet environment in China. No revenues derived from these nonmonetary transactions were recognized. Consolidation of VIEs PRC law currently restricts foreign ownership of internet-based and mobile-based businesses and regulates internet access, distribution of online information, online advertising, distribution and operation of online games through strict business licensing requirements and other government regulations. We are a Cayman Islands company and to comply with these foreign ownership restrictions, we operate our website and conduct substantially the majority of our online advertising and the distribution and operation of internet value-added services and internet security services businesses in the PRC through the VIEs. Beike Internet and Beijing Network hold the requisite ICP licenses required to operate our internet-based, including mobile-based, businesses in China. We have been and are expected to continue to be dependent on our VIEs to operate our business if PRC laws do not allow us to directly operate such business in China. Beijing Security and Conew Network, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, as the case may be, have entered into a series of contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their respective shareholders. Despite the lack of technical majority ownership, there exists a parent-subsidiary relationship between our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the VIEs through the irrevocable shareholder voting proxy agreements, whereby the shareholders of the VIEs effectively assign all of the voting rights underlying their equity interests in the VIEs to our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Furthermore, pursuant to the exclusive equity option agreements, which include a substantive kick-out right, our wholly-owned subsidiaries have the power to control the shareholders of the VIEs, and therefore, the power to govern the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. In addition, through the contractual arrangements, our wholly-owned subsidiaries demonstrate their ability and intention to continue to exercise the ability to absorb substantially all of the expected losses and the majority of the profits of the VIEs, and therefore, have the rights to the economic benefits of the VIEs. As a result of these contractual arrangements, we consolidate the VIEs as required by ASC 810-10, Consolidation: Overall. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed of an acquired business. In accordance with ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, recorded goodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present. 98 Table of Contents We adopted Accounting Standards Update 2011-08, or ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, to test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step one of the goodwill impairment test. If we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than the carrying amount, a two-step impairment test is required. Otherwise, further testing is not needed. We have an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. We may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. Under the two-step impairment test, the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Fair value is primarily determined by computing the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit. If the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired. If this occurs, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If the implied goodwills fair value is less than its carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss. If we reorganize our reporting structure in a manner that changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, goodwill is reassigned based on the relative fair value of each of the affected reporting units. We have one reporting unit and use the discounted cash flow method to derive enterprise value as a basis of our impairment test. Business Combinations We account for its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC topic 805, or ASC 805, Business Combinations. The purchase method of accounting requires that the consideration transferred to be allocated to the assets, including separately identifiable assets and liabilities we acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The consideration transferred of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets given, liabilities incurred, and equity instruments issued as well as the contingent considerations and all contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date. The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair value as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling interests. The excess of (i) the total of cost of acquisition, fair value of the noncontrolling interests and acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over (ii) the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in earnings. The determination and allocation of fair values to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable judgment from management. The most significant variables in these valuations are discount rates, terminal values, the number of years on which to base the cash flow projections, as well as the assumptions and estimates used to determine the cash inflows and outflows. We determine discount rates to be used based on the risk inherent in the related activitys current business model and industry comparisons. Terminal values are based on the expected life of assets, forecasted life cycle and forecasted cash flows over that period. Impairment of Investments Our investments mainly consist of cost method investments and equity method investments in privately held companies, held-to-maturity securities and available-for-sale securities. We periodically review our cost method investments and equity method investments for impairment. If we conclude that any of such investments is impaired, we will assess whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider in making such determination include the performance and financial position of the investee as well as other evidence of market value. Such evaluation includes, but is not limited to, reviewing the investees cash position, recent financing, projected and historical financial performance, cash flow forecasts and financing needs. An impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal to the excess of the investments cost over its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made. The fair value would then become the new cost basis of investment. For held-to-maturity securities, we evaluate whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other-than-temporary in accordance with our policy and ASC topic 320, or ASC 320, InvestmentsDebt and Equity Securities. When we intend to sell an impaired debt security or it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred. In these instances, the other-than-temporary impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal to the entire excess of the debt securitys amortized cost basis over its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made. When we do not intended to sell an impaired debt security and it is more-likely-than-not that we will not be required to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, we must determine whether or not it will recover our amortized cost basis. If we conclude that we will not, an other-than-temporary impairment exists and that portion of the credit-loss is recognized in earnings, while the portion of loss related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. As available-for-sale securities is reported at fair value, an impairment loss on the available-for-sale securities would be recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income when the decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary. The fair value determination, particularly for investments in privately-held companies, requires significant judgment in determining appropriate estimates and assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of whether any identified impairment is other-than-temporary. If impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and take the corresponding charge to the consolidated financial statements. 99 Table of Contents Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles We evaluate our long-lived assets or asset group, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or a group of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When these events occur, we evaluate impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the assets, we would recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Share-based Compensation We account for share-based compensation following the provision of ASC 718, or ASC 718, CompensationStock Compensation, under which we determine whether an award should be classified and accounted for as a liability award or equity award. All grants of share-based awards to employees classified as equity awards are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their grant date fair values and the related cost is recognized over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period. All grants of share-based awards to employees classified as liability awards are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their grant date fair values and re-measured to fair value at the end of each reporting period. The liability recorded considers the fair value of the award and the number of awards that have vested to date. Re-measurement of the fair value of the liability awards is recorded as share-based compensation expenses. We have no liability awards for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 and issued restricted shares with redemption features to two employees that are considered tandem awards, having both equity and liability components, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014. We have elected to recognize share-based compensation using the accelerated method, for all share-based awards granted with graded vesting based on service conditions. Forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical experience and future expectations of employee turnover rates and are periodically reviewed. If required vesting conditions are not met resulting in the forfeiture of the share-based awards, previously recognized compensation expense related to those awards are reversed. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in the subsequent period if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. To the extent we revise these estimates in the future, the share-based payments could be materially impacted in the period of revision, as well as in following periods. Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that expense is recorded only for those share-based awards that are expected to vest. We have determined the fair value of share-based awards with the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm. 100 Table of Contents Fair Value of Our Ordinary Shares Prior to the completion of our initial public offering, as a private company with no quoted market in our ordinary shares, we need to estimate the fair value of our ordinary shares at the relevant grant dates for employee restricted shares and at each reporting date for non-employee options. The determination of the fair value of our ordinary shares requires complex and subjective judgments to be made regarding our projected financial and operating results, our unique business risks, the liquidity of our shares and our operating history and prospects at the time of each grant. In determining the estimated fair value of restricted shares granted to executive officers and certain employees, we have considered the guidance prescribed by the AICPA Audit and Accounting Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid, which sets forth the preferred types of valuation that should be used. We have followed the Level B recommendation, and established the fair value of our ordinary shares at the dates of grant using a retrospective valuation with the assistance of an independent appraiser. We obtained a retrospective valuation instead of contemporaneous valuation because our financial and managerial resources were limited before 2014. We are ultimately responsible for all the fair value measurements in relation to the ordinary shares. In determining the fair value of our ordinary shares prior to the completion of our initial public offering in May 2014, we followed a two-step process. In the first step, the equity value of our company from 2011 to 2013 was determined by taking into consideration the income approach, or the discounted cash flow method. Due to lack of consistencies in the guideline companies valuation ratios, we did not apply any weight for the market approach to arrive at the equity value of our company. Instead, the market approach is only used to corroborate the valuation results based on the income approach. After the estimated offering price range was determined and the underwriters informed us of their valuation methods used in their estimation on April 25, 2014, we revalued our ordinary shares as of January 1 and 2, 2014 for consistency of the basis of estimation of our share-based compensation in the first quarter of 2014. The major changes made in the revaluation included the following: (1) we applied forward looking multiples in a market approach, known as guideline company method, or GCM, and assigned equal weighing to the results derived by income approach and market approach; (2) we also used the same group of comparable companies used by the underwriters in the estimation of the offering price range; (3) as the size of our company increases, small size premium, which is a component used in determination of our weighted average cost of capital, decreases, and as a result, the discount rate used in income approach for valuation as of January 2014 decreases to 16.5%; and (4) with consideration of the latest progress of this offering, the discount for lack of marketability applied in valuation as of January 1 and 2, 2014 decreases to 12%. After the revaluation, we determined the fair value of our ordinary shares as of January 1 and 2, 2014 was US$0.9000. The fair value of our ordinary shares as of March 21, 2014 and April 8, 2014 was determined based on the mid-point of estimated offering range. The discounted cash flow, or DCF, method, which incorporates the projected cash flow of our managements best estimation as of each measurement date. The projected cash flow estimation includes, among others, analysis of projected revenue growth, gross margins and terminal value. The assumptions used in deriving the fair value of ordinary shares are consistent with our business plan. The key assumptions used in developing the cash flow forecasts include: (i) compounded annualized growth rates of revenue range from 12% to 43% over the forecasted period; (ii) gross margin forecast to improve with increasing economies of scale; and (iii) a terminal growth rate after the projection period. 101 Table of Contents The DCF method of the income approach involves applying appropriate weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, to discount the future cash flows forecast to present value. WACC comprises a required rate of return on equity plus the current tax-effected rate of return on debt, weighted by the relative percentages of equity and debt in the capital structure of comparable public companies whose business operations are similar to that of ours. The required rates of return on equity were based on an estimation of the market required rate of return for investing in business similar to ours, which were derived by using the capital asset pricing model, or CAPM. Under CAPM, the discount rate was determined with consideration of the risk-free rate, industry-average correlated relative volatility coefficient beta, equity risk premium, size of our company, the scale of our business and our ability in achieving forecasted projections. The risks associated with achieving the forecasts were assessed in selecting the appropriate WACC, which had been determined to range from 16.5% to 20.5%. In estimating the fair value of our ordinary shares by the DCF method, our management does not think there would be disproportionate returns of cash flows to different shareholders. That is, we do not think the controlling shareholders would receive greater returns than the non-controlling shareholders through their control of business decisions or participation in the daily operations of the business. Therefore, neither control premium nor a lack of control discount was considered in our valuations. The guideline company method of the market approach provides an indication of value with reference to the market value of publicly traded guideline companies and various measures of their operating results, then applying such multiples to the business being valued. For the market approach, we and the independent appraiser considered the market profile and performance of the five publicly traded companies in the Chinese internet and mobile services sector, and used such information to derive market multiples. We and the independent appraiser then calculated the three multiples for the guideline companies: enterprise value (EV) to 2014 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, (EBITDA) multiple, EV to 2014 earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) and price to 2014 earning (P/E) multiple. The median of the guideline companies multiples were then multiplied by our estimated EBITDA, EBIT and earning in 2014 to arrive at the fair value of our company. We also applied a discount for lack of marketability, or DLOM, ranging from 40% to 12%, to reflect the fact that there is no ready market for shares in a closely-held company like us. When determining the DLOM, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. Under this option-pricing method, the cost of the put option, which can hedge the price change before the privately held shares can be sold, was considered as a basis to determine the discount for lack of marketability. This option pricing method was used because it takes into account certain company-specific factors, including the timing of the expected initial public offering and the volatility of the share price of the guideline companies engaged in the same industry. The above assumptions used in determining the fair values were consistent with our business plan and major milestones we achieved. We also applied general assumptions, including the following: · there will be no major changes in the existing political, legal, fiscal and economic conditions in countries in which we will carry on our business; · there will be no major changes in the current taxation law in countries in which we operates, that the rates of tax payable remain unchanged and that all applicable laws and regulations will be complied with; 102 Table of Contents · exchange rates and interest rates will not differ materially from those presently prevailing; · the availability of financing will not be a constraint on the future growth of our operation; · we will retain and have competent management, key personnel, and technical staff to support our ongoing operation; and · industry trends and market conditions for related industries will not deviate significantly from economic forecasts. In the second step, since our capital structure comprised convertible preferred shares and ordinary shares at each grant date, we allocated our equity value among each class of equity securities using the option-pricing method. The option-pricing method treats ordinary shares and preferred shares as call options on our companys equity value and liquidation preference of the preferred shares. In determining the fair value of restricted shares with an option feature granted on January 2, March 21 and April 8, 2014, we use the binomial tree model for an option pricing applied. As the grantees were required to pay purchase price for their restricted shares, the restricted shares are treated as an option for the purpose of determining the fair value of such restricted shares. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the restricted shares with the option feature at the relevant grant dates in 2014 were as follows. Changes in these assumptions could significantly affect the fair value of the restricted shares and hence the amount of share-based compensation expense we recognize in our consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the key assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the restricted shares with the option feature granted in the periods presented: 2014 Risk-free interest rates(1) 2.65%~3.22% Expected volatility range(2) 64.5%~66.2% Expected dividend yield(3) 0% Expected exercise multiple(4) 2.2~2.8 (1) The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the restricted shares with the option feature is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the expected term of the awards. (2) Expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility ordinary shares of several comparable companies in the same industry. (3) The dividend yield was estimated based on our expected dividend policy over the expected term of the restricted shares with the option feature. (4) The expected exercise multiple was based on research study regarding exercise pattern and historical statistic data. If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share-based compensation expenses in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model, our share-based compensation expenses in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in prior periods and could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share. 103 Table of Contents Since our initial public offering in May 2014, the determination of the fair value of the ordinary shares is based on the market price of our ADSs, each representing ten Class A ordinary shares, traded on the NYSE. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial StatementsGoing Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The guidance requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows and Working Capital To date, we have financed our operations from our operating income, private issuances and sales of preferred and ordinary shares and the net proceeds from our initial public offering. As of December 31, 2014, we had RMB1,093.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our cash and the anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next 12 months. However, we may require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to selectively pursue. If our existing cash resources are insufficient to meet our requirements, we may seek to sell equity or equity-linked securities, debt securities or borrow from banks. Under PRC regulations, prior approval from and prior registration with the SAFE is required for Renminbi conversion for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China. Subject to certain rules and procedures, the Renminbi is freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, and trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends to our shareholders. The table below sets forth a breakdown of our cash by currency and location as of December 31, 2012 and 2013 and 2014: 104 Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014 (In thousands of RMB) Cash located outside of the PRC - in US dollars 1,935 287,698 713,716 - in RMB 21,247 4,795 8,970 - in HK dollars 1,810 965 12,914 - in Japanese yen   346 - in Euro   61 - in GB pounds   46 Cash located in the PRC - held by WFOE in RMB 60,647 95,293 287,531 - held by VIEs in RMB 48,737 140,474 67,434 - held by VIEs in US dollars  1,311 2,267 Total cash and cash equivalents 134,376 530,536 1,093,285 The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014 RMB RMB RMB US$ (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 45,788 198,181 361,442 58,255 Net cash used for investing activities (51,238 ) (100,787 ) (1,175,295 ) (189,423 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 628 304,272 1,380,889 222,558 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (151 ) (5,506 ) (4,287 ) (691 ) Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of year 139,349 134,376 530,536 85,507 Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (4,973 ) 396,160 562,749 90,699 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year 134,376 530,536 1,093,285 176,206 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to RMB361.4 million (US$58.3 million) in 2014 from RMB198.2 million in 2013. This amount was primarily attributable to net income of RMB66.9 million (US$10.8 million), (i) adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, primarily share-based compensation expenses of RMB173.3 million (US$27.9 million), amortization of intangible assets of RMB57.1 million (US$9.2 million), depreciation of property and equipment of RMB21.7 million (US$3.5 million) and changes in fair value of contingent consideration of RMB13.7 million (US$2.2 million); (ii) adjusted for changes in operating assets and liabilities that positively affected operating cash flow, primarily an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of RMB225.4 million (US$36.3 million); and (iii) partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that negatively affected operating cash flow, primarily an increase in accounts receivable of RMB152.0 million (US$24.5 million) and an increase in prepayments and other current assets of RMB85.5 million (US$13.8 million). The amortization of intangible assets was mainly related to technology, customer relationship and user base that were acquired through business acquisition and prepaid license fees for games. The increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was mainly attributable to (i) the increase in accrued advertising, marketing and promotional expenses, which primarily resulted from unpaid expenses incurred in promoting our mobile applications, and (ii) the increase in labor and welfare payable relating to our increased headcount and increased salary levels. The increase in accounts receivable is in line with the rapid growth of our business. 105 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was RMB198.2 million. This amount was primarily attributable to net income of RMB62.0 million, (i) adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, primarily share-based compensation expenses of RMB37.4 million, deferred income tax expense of RMB33.9 million, deemed employee compensation attributable to redemption right granted to a noncontrolling shareholder of RMB14.7 million and amortization of intangible assets of RMB14.2 million, (ii) adjusted for changes in operating assets and liabilities that positively affected operating cash flow, primarily an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of RMB97.1 million, and (iii) partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that negatively affected operating cash flow, primarily an increase in prepayments and other current assets of RMB45.4 million. The deferred income tax expenses mainly resulted from the outside basis difference arising from the retained earnings in Beike Internet, our VIE, and the deferred tax liability related to the non-deductible share-based compensation expense, which primarily resulted from the difference between PRC tax regulations and their practical implementation by PRC tax authorities. The increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was mainly attributable to (i) the increase in accrued advertising, marketing and promotional expenses, which primarily resulted from unpaid expenses incurred in promoting our mobile applications, and (ii) increase in labor and welfare payable relating to our increased headcount and increased salary levels. The increase in prepayments and other current assets was mainly attributable to receivable from employees related to the individual income tax arising from the vested restricted shares of our company. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 was RMB45.8 million. This amount was primarily attributable to net income of RMB9.8 million, (i) adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, primarily share-based compensation expenses of RMB20.3 million, (ii) adjusted for changes in operating assets and liabilities that positively affected operating cash flow, primarily an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of RMB38.3 million, and (iii) partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that negatively affected operating cash flow, primarily an increase in accounts receivable of RMB23.4 million and an increase in due from related party of RMB11.1 million. The increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was mainly attributable to (i) the increase in labor and welfare payable relating to our increased headcount and increased salary levels and (ii) increase in accrued advertising, marketing and promotional expenses, which primarily resulted from unpaid expenses incurred in promoting our mobile applications. The increase in accounts receivable was in line with our business growth. The increase in due from related parties was primarily due to the outstanding receivable from a shareholders affiliated company. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased to RMB1.2 billion (US$189.4 million) in 2014 from RMB100.8 million in 2013, primarily attributable to purchase of held-to-maturity investments of RMB1,388.2 million (US$223.7 million), acquisition of business (net of cash acquired) of RMB195.2 million (US$31.5 million), purchase of cost method investments of RMB151.3 million (US$24.4 million), purchase of equity method investments of RMB125.7 million (US$20.3 million), purchase of intangible assets of RMB120.4 million (US$19.4 million) and purchase of available-for-sale securities of RMB110.8 million (US$17.9 million), partially offset by sales and maturity of short-term investments of RMB959.8 million (US$154.7 million). 106 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was RMB100.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily attributable to payments to purchase short-term investments of RMB141.6 million, payments for acquisition of business (net of cash acquired) RMB52.8 million, purchase of property and equipment of RMB27.6 million, entrusted loan to investors of an investee of RMB14.0 million, partially offset by sales and maturity of short-term investments of RMB145.4 million.

Financing Activities Net cash generated from financing activities was RMB1.4 billion (US$222.6 million) in 2014, compared to net cash of RMB304.3 million generated from financing activities in 2013. This increase was primarily due to the net proceeds of US$227.1 million from our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement completed in May 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities was RMB304.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily attributable to proceeds from issuance of series B preferred shares (net of issuance costs) of RMB322.0 million, partially offset by payment of dividend of RMB17.7 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was RMB0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 from proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares. Holding Company Structure Cheetah Mobile Inc. is a holding company with no operations of its own. We conduct our operations in China primarily through our subsidiaries, VIEs and a VIEs subsidiary in China. As a result, although other means are available for us to obtain financing at the holding company level, Cheetah Mobile Inc.s ability to pay dividends to the shareholders and to service any debt it may incur may depend on dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries and service fees paid by our PRC VIEs to our PRC subsidiaries under the exclusive technology development, support and consultancy agreements. If any of our subsidiaries incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing such debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends to us. Each of our PRC entities are required to make appropriations to certain statutory reserve funds, which are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of a solvent liquidation of the companies. Specifically, each of our PRC entities is required to allocate at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds until such reserve funds reach 50% of its registered capital. In addition, each of our PRC entities may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds, enterprise expansion fund and discretionary surplus fund, as the case may be, at the discretion of its board of directors. Loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits, which is the difference between the registered capital of such PRC subsidiary and the amount of total investment as approved by the PRC government. In addition, if we decide to finance our PRC subsidiaries by means of capital contributions, these capital contributions must be approved by the PRC government. Therefore, any failure or delay in receiving such registrations or approvals may limit our ability to fund our PRC subsidiaries using funds we have, such as the net proceeds we received from our initial public offering, hence materially and adversely affecting our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. 107 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures We incurred capital expenditures of RMB17.9 million, RMB30.0 million and RMB156.6 million (US$25.2 million) in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Our capital expenditures were primarily used to purchase intangible assets including intellectual property, game copyrights and tools applications, computers, servers and other equipment. As our business expands, we may purchase more intangible assets, new servers and other equipment in the future. C. Research and Development We seek to be at the forefront of our industry by meeting and exceeding user needs through the development of innovative products and services. Our R&D and innovation are driven by our user centric culture. From our line engineers to our chief executive officer, everyone involved in our interactive product development process focuses on developing and enhancing products and services to anticipate, meet and exceed our users expectations. Through various channels such as pre-release trial events among our fans in various countries, feedback from closed beta testing and user comments and ratings on application distribution platforms, our massive global user base provides us with an invaluable source of information regarding our products and services and the evolution of the mobile industry. We then feed the ideas back into our development processes to innovate and enhance our products and services. As of December 31, 2014, our engineering team consisted of 1,268 employees, approximately 78% of whom hold bachelors or more advanced degrees. In addition, we have a dedicated customer service team capable of operating in over 30 languages that interacts with users and receives users input and advice regarding further product development.

We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholders equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.

Our directors may exercise all the powers of our company to borrow money, mortgage or charge our undertaking, property and uncalled capital, and to issue debentures, debenture stock and other securities whether outright or as security for any debt, liability or obligation of our company or of any third party. 116 Table of Contents Committees of the Board of Directors We have established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee under the board of directors. We have adopted a charter for each of the three committees. Each committees members and functions are described below. Audit Committee Our audit committee consists of Richard Weidong Ji, Yuk Keung Ng and David Ying Zhang, and is chaired by Richard Weidong Ji. Our board of directors has determined that Richard Weidong Ji and David Ying Zhang both meet the independence requirements of NYSE and the independence standards under Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. We have determined that Richard Weidong Ji qualifies as an audit committee financial expert. The audit committee oversees our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of the financial statements of our company. The audit committee is responsible for, among other things: · selecting the independent registered public accounting firm and pre-approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm; · reviewing with the independent registered public accounting firm any audit problems or difficulties and managements response; · reviewing and approving all proposed related party transactions, as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act; · discussing the annual audited financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm; · reviewing major issues as to the adequacy of our internal controls and any special audit steps adopted in light of any material control deficiencies; · annually reviewing and reassessing the adequacy of our audit committee charter; · meeting separately and periodically with management and the independent registered public accounting firm; and · reporting regularly to the board. Compensation Committee Our compensation committee consists of Jun Lei, Richard Weidong Ji and David Ying Zhang, and is chaired by Jun Lei. Our board of directors has determined that David Ying Zhang and Richard Weidong Ji both satisfy the independence standards under applicable NYSE corporate governance rules. Upon expiration of the one-year phase-in period that we currently rely on, we intend to rely on the controlled company exemption available under applicable NYSE corporate governance rules with respect to the composition of our compensation committee. The compensation committee assists the board in reviewing and approving the compensation structure, including all forms of compensation, relating to our directors and executive officers. Our chief executive officer may not be present at any committee meeting during which his compensation is deliberated upon. The compensation committee is responsible for, among other things: 117 Table of Contents · reviewing and approving, or recommending to the board for its approval, the compensation for our chief executive officer and other executive officers; · reviewing and recommending to the board for determination with respect to the compensation of our non-employee directors; · reviewing periodically and approving any incentive compensation or equity plans, programs or similar arrangements; and · selecting compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser only after taking into consideration all factors relevant to that persons independence from management. Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Our nominating and corporate governance committee consists of Jun Lei, Sheng Fu and David Ying Zhang, and is chaired by David Ying Zhang. Our board of directors has determined that David Ying Zhang satisfies the independence standards under applicable NYSE corporate governance rules. Upon expiration of the one-year phase-in period that we currently rely on, we intend to rely on the controlled company exemption available under applicable NYSE corporate governance rules with respect to the composition of our nominating and corporate governance committee. The committee assists the board in selecting individuals qualified to become our directors and in determining the composition of the board and its committees. The committee is responsible for, among other things: · recommending nominees to the board for election or re-election to the board, or for appointment to fill any vacancy on the board; · reviewing annually with the board the current composition of the board with regard to characteristics such as independence, skills, experience, expertise, diversity, and availability of service to us; · selecting and recommending to the board the directors to serve as members of each standing committee of the board; and · developing and reviewing periodically the corporate governance principles adopted by the board to ensure appropriateness and compliance with the requirements of the NYSE, and to recommend any desirable changes to the board. Duties of Directors Under Cayman Islands law, our directors have a fiduciary duty to act honestly, in good faith and with a view to our best interests. Our directors also owe to our company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands. In fulfilling their duty of care to us, our directors must ensure compliance with our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time. 118 Table of Contents Terms of Directors and Executive Officers Our officers are elected by and serve at the discretion of the board. Our directors are not subject to a term of office and hold office until such time as they resign or are removed from office by ordinary resolution or the unanimous written resolution of all shareholders. A director will be removed from office automatically if, among other things, the director (1) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors; (2) dies or is found to be or becomes of unsound mind; or (3) without special leave of absence from the board of directors, is absent from meetings of the board for three consecutive meetings and the board resolves that his office be vacated. D. Employees We had 692, 1,178 and 1,809 employees as of December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

Share Ownership For information regarding the share ownership of our directors and officers, see Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party TransactionsA. Major Shareholders. For information as to share awards granted to our directors, executive officers and other employees, see Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesB. CompensationShare Incentive Plans. Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions A. Major Shareholders The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our shares as of March 31, 2015 by: · each of our current directors and executive officers; and · each person known to us to own beneficially more than 5% of our shares. Percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 1,423,901,876 total outstanding ordinary shares as of March 31, 2015, representing the sum of 332,537,724 Class A ordinary shares and 1,091,364,152 Class B ordinary shares of our company. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These rules generally provide that a person is the beneficial owner of securities if such person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of securities, or to dispose or direct the disposition of securities or has the right to acquire such powers within 60 days. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we have included shares that the person has the right to acquire within 60 days, including through the exercise of any option, warrant or other right or the conversion of any other security, in both the numerator and the denominator. These shares, however, are not included in the computation of the percentage ownership of any other person. 119 Table of Contents Ordinary Shares Shares Beneficially Owned Beneficially Class A Class B Owned Voting Power Directors and executive officers**: Ordinary Shares Ordinary Shares %(1) %(2) Jun Lei(3)     Sheng Fu(4) 32,500,000 82,644,330 8.1 7.6 Hongjiang Zhang(5)     Yuk Keung Ng(6) *  * * David Ying Zhang(7) 39,586,743 42,168,675 5.7 4.1 Ke Ding(8)     Zhijian Peng(9) *  * * Wei Liu(10)     Richard Weidong Ji(11) *  * * Ming Xu(12) 10,000,000 47,575,395 4.0 4.3 Ka Wai Andy Yeung     Xinhua Liu  * * * Jie Xiao  * * * Yong Chen * * * * All directors and executive officers as a group 86,057,597 191,158,400 19.1 17.8 Principal Shareholders: Kingsoft Corporation Limited(13) 5,040,877 662,806,049 46.9 59.0 Tencent Holdings Limited(14) 15,031,120 220,481,928 16.5 19.7 Sheng Global Limited (15) 32,500,000 47,500,000 5.6 4.5 Matrix Partners Funds(16) 39,552,090 42,168,675 5.7 4.1 * Less than 1% of our total outstanding Class A and Class B ordinary shares. ** Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes, the business address for our directors and officers is 12/F, Fosun International Center Tower, No. 237 Chaoyang North Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100022, Peoples Republic of China.
