Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks related to our properties and our business Our results of operations are subject to the following risks inherent in the student housing industry: annual leasing cycle, concentrated lease-up period, seasonal cash flows and increased risk of student defaults during the summer months of a twelve-month lease. We generally lease our properties under 11.5 month leases, but we may also lease for terms of nine months or less. As a result, we may experience significantly reduced cash flows during the summer months at properties leased for terms shorter than twelve months. In addition, students leasing under twelve-month leases may be more likely to default in their rental payments during the summer months. Although we typically require a students parents to guarantee the students lease, we may have to spend considerable effort and expense in pursuing payment upon a defaulted lease, and our efforts may not be successful. Furthermore, all of our properties must be entirely re-leased each year, exposing us to increased leasing risk. In addition, we are subject to increased leasing risk on properties that we acquire that we have not previously managed due to our lack of experience leasing those properties and unfamiliarity with their leasing cycles. Student housing communities are typically leased during a limited leasing season that begins in February and ends in August of each year. We are therefore highly dependent on the effectiveness of our marketing and leasing efforts and personnel during this season. Our use of debt financing reduces cash available for distribution and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations. Our charter and bylaws impose no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur. Our debt service obligations expose us to the risk of default and reduce (or eliminate) cash resources that are available to operate our business. On the Closing Date, we entered into a $75 million revolving credit facility to fund future property acquisitions and for other working capital needs, which may include the payment of distributions to our stockholders. Subsequently, the credit facility was amended to increase the availability to $100 million. The amount available to us and our ability to borrow from time to time under this facility is subject to certain conditions and the satisfaction of specified financial covenants, which include limiting distributions to our stockholders. If the income generated by our properties and other assets fails to cover our debt service, we would be forced to reduce or eliminate distributions to our stockholders and may experience losses. Our level of debt and the operating limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:  we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms;  we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;  we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms;  we may default on our payment or other obligations as a result of insufficient cash flow or otherwise, and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases; and  foreclosures could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, a circumstance that could hinder our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements. On March 30, 2006 the revolving credit facility was amended and restated and the Operating Partnership entered into a $50 million senior unsecured term loan. The amended credit facility has substantially the same terms as the original facility, including $100 million of availability and customary affirmative and negative covenants. 13 Table of Contents We are recently organized and have no operating history. We have been recently organized and had no operating history until the Closing Date. Consequently, our historical operating results and the financial data set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10K may not be useful in assessing our likely future performance. The operating performance of the properties may decline under our management, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from operations to make anticipated distributions. We will also be subject to the risks generally associated with the formation of any new business. Our management has no prior experience in running a public company. The consideration we paid for our initial assets may exceed their fair market value. On the Closing Date, we acquired our initial properties and our Management Company and Development Company in exchange for cash, Operating Partnership units and University Towers Partnership units. We did not obtain independent appraisals of the initial properties or the management and development businesses. In addition, the terms of the contribution and sale agreements relating to the purchase of our College Station property and our Management Company, which includes our Development Company as its wholly owned subsidiary, were not negotiated at arms length. Certain of our officers, specifically, Messrs. Bower, Brown, Cardwell, Harris, Hickey and Wilcox, received collectively through their ownership of interests in properties held by the EDR Predecessor and our Management Company and our Development Company, total consideration of approximately $19.9 million, including Operating Partnership units and University Towers Partnership units of $17.2 million and cash of $2.7 million, which were used to repay certain unaffiliated third-party loans incurred by the EDR Predecessor. In addition, we paid approximately $800,000 in cash to an affiliate for certain office furniture and equipment. It is possible that the consideration we provided in exchange for these assets may exceed their fair market value and that we could realize less value from the assets than we would have realized if all of the contribution or sale agreements had been entered into with an unrelated third party or if we had obtained independent appraisals of the assets. We face significant competition from university-owned student housing and from other private student housing communities located within close proximity to universities. Many students prefer on-campus housing to off-campus housing because of the closer physical proximity to campus and integration of on-campus facilities into the academic community. Universities can generally avoid real estate taxes and borrow funds at lower interest rates, while we and other private-sector operators pay full real estate tax rates and have higher borrowing costs. Consequently, universities often can offer more convenient and/or less expensive student housing than we can, which can adversely affect our occupancy and rental rates. We also compete with other national and regional owner-operators of off-campus student housing in a number of markets as well as with smaller local owner-operators. There are a number of purpose-built student housing properties that compete directly with us located near or in the same general vicinity of many of our student housing communities. Such competing student housing communities may be newer than our student housing communities, located closer to campus, charge less rent, possess more attractive amenities, or offer more services, shorter lease terms or more flexible leases. The construction of competing properties or decreases in the general levels of rents for housing in competing properties could adversely affect our rental income. We believe that a number of other large national companies may be potential entrants in the student housing business. In some cases, these potential competitors possess substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we do. The entry of one or more of these companies could increase competition for student tenants and for the acquisition, development and management of other student housing communities. 14 Table of Contents We may not be able to recover our costs for our development consulting services. We typically are awarded development consulting services business on the basis of a competitive award process, but definitive contracts are typically not executed until the formal approval of the transaction by the institutions governing body at the completion of the project. In the intervening period, we may incur significant pre-development and other costs in the expectation that the development consulting services contract will be executed. These costs generally range from $300,000 to $500,000 and typically include architects fees to design the property and contractors fees to price the construction. We typically seek to enter into a reimbursement agreement with the institution that requires the institution to provide a guarantee of our advances. However, we may not be successful in negotiating such an agreement. In addition, if an institutions governing body does not ultimately approve our selection and the underlying terms of a pending development, we may not be able to recover these costs from the institution. In addition, when we are awarded development consulting business, we generally receive 50% of our fees at the time the project is financed, and the remainder is generally paid in monthly installments thereafter. As a result, the recognition and timing of revenues will, among other things, be contingent upon the project owners successful structuring and closing of the project financing as well as the timing of construction. We may be unable to take advantage of certain disposition opportunities because of additional costs we have agreed to pay if we sell certain of our properties in taxable transactions for a period of five years. On the Closing Date, we issued Operating Partnership units as partial or full consideration for our interests in two properties in the JPI portfolio and University Towers Partnership units for our interest in University Towers. So long as the contributing owners of such properties hold at least 25% of the Operating Partnership units or University Towers Partnership units that they received on the Closing Date, we have agreed to maintain certain minimum amounts of debt on the properties so as to avoid triggering gain to the contributing owners. If we fail to do this, we will owe to the contributing owners the amount of taxes that they incur. In each case, the amount of tax is computed assuming the highest federal and state rates. As a result, these agreements may preclude us from selling the restricted properties at the optimal time. We rely on our relationships with universities, and changes in university personnel and/or policies could adversely affect our operating results. In some cases, we rely on our relationships with universities for referrals of prospective tenants or for mailing lists of prospective tenants and their parents. The failure to maintain good relationships with personnel at these universities could therefore have a material adverse effect on us. If universities refuse to make their lists of prospective student-tenants and their parents available to us or increase the costs of these lists, the increased costs or failure to obtain such lists could also have a material adverse effect on us. We may be adversely affected by a change in university admission policies. For example, if a university reduces the number of student admissions, the demand for our properties may be reduced and our occupancy rates may decline. In addition, universities may institute a policy that a certain class of students, such as freshmen, must live in a university-owned facility, which would also reduce the demand for our properties. While we may engage in marketing efforts to compensate for such policy changes, we may not be able to effect such marketing efforts prior to the commencement of the annual lease-up period or at all. Our growth will be dependent upon our ability to acquire and/or develop, lease, integrate and manage additional student housing communities successfully. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify real estate investments that meet our investment criteria, that we will be successful in completing any acquisition we identify or that any 15 Table of Contents acquisition we complete using the proceeds of our initial public offering will produce a return on our investment. We will have broad authority to invest in real estate investments that we identify in the future. Our future growth will be dependent upon our ability to successfully acquire new properties on favorable terms, which may be adversely affected by the following significant risks:  we may be unable to acquire a desired property at all or at a desired purchase price because of competition from other purchasers of student housing;  many of our future acquisitions are likely to be dependent on external financing, and we may be unable to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all;  we may be required to incur significant capital expenditures to improve or renovate acquired properties;  we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations;  market conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates; and  we may acquire properties subject to liabilities but without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the sellers, or with liabilities that are unknown to us, such as liabilities for undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by members, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. As we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and integration risks. Newly acquired properties may not perform as expected, and newly acquired properties may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us at the time of acquisition. Risks related to the real estate industry Our performance and the value of our real estate assets are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and with the real estate industry. Our ability to make distributions to our stockholders depends on our ability to generate cash revenues in excess of expenses, scheduled debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements. Events and conditions generally applicable to owners and operators of real property that are beyond our control may decrease cash available for distribution and the value of our properties. These events include:  local oversupply of student housing units, increased competition or reduction in demand for student housing;  inability to collect rent from tenants;  vacancies or our inability to lease beds on favorable terms;  increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities, and real estate taxes;  costs of complying with changes in governmental regulations;  the relative illiquidity of real estate investments;  changing student demographics;  national, regional and local economic conditions; and  rising interest rates. 16 Table of Contents We have limited time to perform due diligence on many of our acquired properties, which could subject us to significant unexpected liabilities and under-performance of the acquired properties. When we enter into an agreement to acquire a property, we often have limited time to complete our due diligence prior to acquiring the property. Because our internal resources are limited, we may rely on third parties to conduct a portion of our due diligence. To the extent these third parties or we underestimate or fail to identify risks and liabilities associated with the properties we acquire, we may incur unexpected liabilities, or the property may fail to perform in accordance with our projections. If, during the due diligence phase, we do not accurately assess the value of and liabilities associated with a particular property, we may pay a purchase price that exceeds the current fair value of the assets. As a result, material goodwill and other intangible assets would be recorded, which could result in significant charges to earnings in future periods. These charges, in addition to the financial impact of significant liabilities that we may assume, could seriously harm our financial and operating results, as well as our ability to pay dividends. Certain losses may not be covered by insurance. We carry insurance covering comprehensive liability, fire, earthquake, terrorism, business interruption, vandalism and malicious mischief, extended coverage perils, physical loss perils, commercial general liability, personal injury, workers compensation, business, automobile, errors and omissions, employee dishonesty, employment practices liability and rental loss with respect to all of the properties in our portfolio and the operation of our Management Company and Development Company. We also carry insurance covering terrorism and flood (when the property is located in whole or in material part in a designated flood plain area) on some of our properties. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. There are, however, certain types of losses (such as property damage from riots or wars, employment discrimination losses, punitive damage awards, terrorism or acts of God) that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Some of our policies are subject to large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses. In addition, we may discontinue earthquake, terrorism or other insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for these policies exceeds, in our judgment, the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged. Future terrorist attacks in the United States could harm the demand for and the value of our student housing communities. Future terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the attacks that occurred in New York and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001, and other acts of terrorism or war, or threats of the same, could harm the demand for and the value of our properties. A decrease in demand in our markets would make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties at rates equal to or above historical rates. Terrorist attacks also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction, loss or increased security costs, and the availability or cost of insurance for such acts. If we receive casualty proceeds, we may not be able to reinvest such proceeds profitably or at all, and we may be forced to recognize taxable gain on the affected property. We could incur significant costs related to government regulation and private litigation over environmental matters. Under various environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for contamination resulting from the release or threatened release of hazardous or toxic substances or 17 Table of Contents petroleum at that property, and an entity that arranges for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous or toxic substance or petroleum at another property may be held jointly and severally liable for the cost to investigate and clean up such property or other affected property. Such parties are known as potentially responsible parties, or PRPs. Environmental laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the costs of any required investigation or cleanup of these substances can be substantial. PRPs are liable to the government as well as to other PRPs who may have claims for contribution. The liability is generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the propertys value and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties also may expose us to third-party liability for personal injury or property damage, or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real property or to borrow using the real property as collateral. We do not carry environmental insurance on any of the properties in our portfolio. Environmental laws also impose ongoing compliance requirements on owners and operators of real property. Environmental laws potentially affecting us address a wide variety of matters, including, but not limited to, asbestos-containing building materials, storage tanks, storm water and wastewater discharges, lead-based paint, wetlands and hazardous wastes. Failure to comply with these laws could result in fines and penalties and/or expose us to third-party liability. Some of our properties may have conditions that are subject to these requirements, and we could be liable for such fines or penalties and/or liable to third parties for those conditions. We could be exposed to liability and remedial costs related to environmental matters. Certain properties in our portfolio may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing building materials, or ACBMs. Environmental laws require that ACBMs be properly managed and maintained, and may impose fines and penalties on building owners and operators for failure to comply with these requirements. Also, certain properties may contain, or may have contained, or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Certain properties in our portfolio contain, or may have contained, elevated radon levels. Third parties may be permitted by law to seek recovery from owners or operators for property damage and/or personal injury associated with exposure to contaminants, including, but not limited to, petroleum products, hazardous or toxic substances and asbestos fibers. Also, some of the properties may contain regulated wetlands that can delay or impede development or require costs to be incurred to mitigate the impact of any disturbance. Absent appropriate permits, we can be held responsible for restoring wetlands and be required to pay fines and penalties. Some of the properties in our portfolio may contain microbial matter such as mold and mildew. The presence of microbial matter could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if any property in our portfolio is not properly connected to a water or sewer system, or if the integrity of such systems are breached, or if water intrusion into our buildings otherwise occurs, microbial matter or other contamination can develop. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. If this were to occur, we could incur significant remedial costs and we may also be subject to material private damage claims and awards. Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing, as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. If we become subject to claims in this regard, it could materially and adversely affect us and our future insurability for such matters. Independent environmental consultants conducted Phase I environmental site assessments on all of our initial properties. Phase I environmental site assessments are intended to evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties based generally on visual observations, interviews and certain publicly available databases. These assessments do not typically take into account all environmental issues including, but not limited to, testing of soil or groundwater or the possible presence of asbestos, lead-based paint, radon, wetlands or mold. Some of the 18 Table of Contents Phase I assessments did, however, test for radon and found elevated radon levels at two properties. A radon mitigation system was implemented at one of the properties and another mitigation system will be needed at one additional property. In addition, a limited Phase II study was conducted on four of the properties and concluded that further investigation was not warranted. None of the site assessments revealed any past or present environmental liability that we believe would be material to us. However, the assessments may have failed to reveal all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns. Material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the assessments were conducted or may arise in the future; and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability. We cannot assure you that costs of future environmental compliance will not affect our ability to make distributions or that such costs or other remedial measures will not be material to us. We may incur significant costs complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Additional federal, state and local laws also may require modifications to our properties, or restrict our ability to renovate our properties. For example, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, or FHAA, requires apartment properties first occupied after March 13, 1990 to be accessible to the handicapped. We have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance with present ADA requirements. Noncompliance with the ADA or FHAA could result in the imposition of fines or an award for damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature. We cannot predict the ultimate amount of the cost of compliance with the ADA, FHAA or other legislation. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA, FHAA or any other legislation, we could be materially and adversely affected. In June 2001, the United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, notified JPI of an on-going investigation regarding possible violations of the ADA and the FHAA at various residential properties developed by JPI, mostly multi-family apartment communities. Of the 14 student housing communities we acquired from JPI on the Closing Date, one property is included in those reviewed by the DOJ to date. The DOJ has reviewed the property plans for this property but has not issued a report regarding its review. In October 2002, the DOJ indicated that the investigations were being delayed for an undetermined period of time. This investigation has not been resolved and, at this point, no conclusion can be reached regarding what will be required to conclude it or whether it will result in a dispute or legal proceedings with the DOJ. Noncompliance with the ADA and the FHAA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. We are unable to predict the outcome of the DOJs investigation related to the JPI portfolio. We may incur significant costs complying with other regulations. The properties in our portfolio are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these various requirements, we might incur governmental fines or be liable for private actions for money damages. Furthermore, existing requirements could change and require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that would materially and adversely affect us. Our potential participation in joint ventures presents additional risks. We may co-invest with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. In such event, we will not have sole decision-making authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. Investments in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, 19 Table of Contents including the possibility that partners or co-venturers may become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners or co-venturers also may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our preferences, policies or objectives. Such investments also will have the potential risk of our reaching impasses with our partners or co-venturers on key decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our management team from focusing its time and effort exclusively on our business. In addition, we may in some circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers. Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties. Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. In acquiring a property, we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property. These transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate. Risks related to our organization and structure To maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to limit the activities of our Management Company. To maintain our status as a REIT, no more than 20% of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries, such as our Management Company. Some of our activities, such as our third-party management, development consulting and food services, must be conducted through our Management Company and Development Company for us to maintain our REIT qualification. In addition, certain non-customary services such as cleaning, transportation, security and, in some cases, parking, must be provided by a taxable REIT subsidiary or an independent contractor. If the revenues from such activities create a risk that the value of our Management Company, based on revenues or otherwise, approaches the 20% threshold, we will be forced to curtail such activities or take other steps to remain under the 20% threshold. Because the 20% threshold is based on value, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, could successfully contend that the value of our Management Company exceeds the 20% threshold even if our Management Company accounts for less than 20% of our consolidated revenues, income or cash flow, in which case our status as a REIT could be jeopardized. We will depend heavily on the availability of equity and debt capital to fund our business. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to distributions paid and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income, including any net capital gains. Because of these distribution requirements, REITs are largely unable to fund capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, renovations, development and property upgrades from operating cash flow. Consequently, we will be largely dependent on the public equity and debt capital markets and private lenders to provide capital to fund our growth and 20 Table of Contents other capital expenditures. We may not be able to obtain this financing on favorable terms or at all. Our access to equity and debt capital depends, in part, on:  general market conditions;  our current debt levels and the number of properties subject to encumbrances;  our current performance and the markets perception of our growth potential;  our cash flow and cash distributions; and  the market price per share of our common stock. If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our debt service obligations or make the cash distributions to our stockholders, including those necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our stock. Our charter provides that, subject to certain exceptions, no person or entity may beneficially own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the Code, more than 9.8% (by value, by number of shares or by voting power, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock or more than 9.8% (by value, by number of shares or by voting power, whichever is more restrictive) of all our outstanding shares, including both common and preferred stock. We refer to this restriction as the ownership limit. Generally, if a beneficial owner of our shares exceeds the ownership limit, such owner will be effectively divested of all ownership rights with respect to shares exceeding the limit and may suffer a loss on his or her investment. The constructive ownership rules under the Code are complex and may cause stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals and/or entities to be owned constructively by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our stock (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns, actually or constructively, our stock) by an individual or entity, could, nevertheless cause that individual or entity, or another individual or entity, to own constructively in excess of 9.8% of our outstanding stock and thereby subject certain shares to the ramifications of exceeding the ownership limit. Our charter, however, permits exceptions to be made to this limitation if our board of directors determines that such exceptions will not jeopardize our tax status as a REIT. This ownership limit could delay, defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction that might otherwise result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. Certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control. Certain provisions contained in our charter and bylaws and the Maryland General Corporation Law may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us, or could delay, defer or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. These provisions also may delay or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of common stock over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include:  the REIT ownership limit described above;  authorization of the issuance of our preferred shares with powers, preferences or rights to be determined by our board of directors;  the right of our board of directors, without a stockholder vote, to increase our authorized shares and classify or reclassify unissued shares; and  advance notice requirements for stockholder nomination of directors and for other proposals to be presented at stockholder meetings. 21 Table of Contents The Maryland business statutes also impose potential restrictions on a change of control of our Company. Various Maryland laws may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us, even if the acquisition would be advantageous to our stockholders. Our bylaws exempt us from some of those laws, such as the control share acquisition provisions, but our board of directors can change our bylaws at any time to make these provisions applicable to us. We have the right to change some of our policies that may be important to our stockholders without stockholder consent. Our major policies, including our policies with respect to investments, leverage, financing, growth, debt and capitalization, are determined by our board of directors or those committees or officers to whom our board of directors has delegated that authority. Our board of directors also establishes the amount of any distributions that we make to our stockholders. Our board of directors may amend or revise the foregoing policies, our distribution payment amounts and other policies from time to time without a stockholder vote. Accordingly, our stockholders may not have control over changes in our policies. The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders. Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders. Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited. Maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In addition, our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money, property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and that is material to the cause of action. Our bylaws require us to indemnify directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacitates to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a result, our stockholders and we may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers. Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. We depend upon the services of our key personnel, particularly Paul O. Bower, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Randall H. Brown, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Craig L. Cardwell, our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. Messrs. Bower and Cardwell each have been in the student housing business for over 30 years, and each of them has developed a network of contacts and a reputation that attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with universities, lenders and industry personnel. In addition, Mr. Brown possesses detailed knowledge of and experience with our financial and ancillary support operations that are critical to our operations and financial reporting obligations as a public company. We will continue to need to attract and retain qualified additional senior executive officers as we grow our business. The loss of the services of any of our senior executive officers, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 22 Table of Contents Federal income tax risks Failure to qualify as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock. We intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under the Code. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS that we qualify as a REIT. If we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because:  we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income, and such amounts would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;  we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and  unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury Regulations that have been promulgated under the Code is greater in the case of a REIT that, like us, holds its assets through a partnership or a limited liability company. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and two gross income tests: (a) at least 75% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualified sources, such as rents from real property, mortgage interest, distributions from other REITs and gains from sale of such assets, and (b) at least 95% of our gross income must be derived from sources meeting the 75% income test above, and other passive investment sources, such as other interest and dividends and gains from sales of securities. Also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gains. In addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors, our ability to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments. We may be subject to federal and state income taxes that would harm our financial condition. Even if we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we may become subject to federal income taxes and related state taxes. For example, if we have net income from a sale of dealer property or inventory, or, if our Management Company enters into agreements with us or our tenants on a basis that is determined to be other than an arms length basis, that income will be subject to a 100% penalty tax. If we believe that a sale of a property might be treated as a prohibited transaction, we will attempt to structure a sale through a taxable REIT subsidiary, in which case the gain from the sale would be subject to corporate income tax but not the 100% prohibited transaction tax. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS would not assert successfully that sales of properties that we make directly, rather than through a taxable REIT subsidiary, were sales of dealer property or inventory, in which case the 100% penalty tax will apply. In addition, we may not be able to make sufficient distributions to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax on undistributed income. We may also be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, either directly or at the level of our Operating Partnership or the University Towers Partnership or at a level of the other entities through which we indirectly own our properties that would aversely affect our operating results. 23 Table of Contents An investment in our common stock has various tax risks, including the treatment of distributions in excess of earnings and the inability to apply passive losses against distributions. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, to the extent that they exceed the adjusted basis of an investors common stock, will be treated as long-term capital gain (or short-term capital gain if the shares have been held for less than one year). Any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares by a stockholder who is not a dealer in securities will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year, and otherwise will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss. Distributions that we properly designate as capital gain distributions will be treated as taxable to stockholders as gains (to the extent that they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year) from the sale or disposition of a capital asset held for greater than one year. Distributions we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a stockholder of shares of our stock will not be treated as passive income, meaning stockholders generally will not be able to apply any passive losses against such income or gain. Future distributions may include a significant portion as a return of capital. Our distributions may exceed the amount of our income as a REIT. If so, the excess distributions will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholders basis in our stock, and the stockholders basis in our stock will be reduced by such amount. To the extent distributions exceed a stockholders basis in our stock, the stockholder will recognize capital gain, assuming the stock is held as a capital asset. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
