Item 1A. Risk Factors.  (Continued). Cyclical and Seasonal Nature of Business The industries in which the Corporation operates are highly cyclical, and are impacted by but not limited to the following conditions:  Availability of wholesale and retail financing;  Consumer confidence;  Interest rates;  Demographic and employment trends;  Availability of used or repossessed homes or park model; and  Impact of inflation. Sales associated with the manufactured housing, modular housing and park model industries are also seasonal in nature with sales being lowest in the winter months. Seasonal changes, in addition to weakness in demand in one or both of the Corporations market segments, could materially impact the Corporations net sales, operating results and cash flows. Dependence on Executive Officers and Other Key Personnel The Corporation depends on the efforts of its executive officers and certain key employees. An unexpected loss of the service of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on net sales, operating results and cash flows of the Corporation. Covenant Compliance The Corporations secured revolving credit facility necessitates compliance with various financial covenants. Subsequent to May 31, 2015, the Corporation on two occasions did not meet a covenant requiring a monthly loss not exceeding $500,000. In addition, at least one monthly loss exceeding $500,000 is projected during the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2016; a period where net sales are at its lowest for the year. The inability to meet the aforementioned covenants represents an event of default, which if not cured or waived could negatively affect the Corporations ability to obtain financing under the facility and thereby have an adverse effect on liquidity. The Corporation has requested a waiver of the existing covenant defaults together with a modification of this covenant. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None 8 Table of Contents
