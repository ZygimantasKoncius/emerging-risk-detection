Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Properties and OperationsOur growth will partially depend upon our ability to successfully acquire future properties, and we may be unable to enter into and consummate property acquisitions on advantageous terms or our property acquisitions may not perform as we expect.We acquire and intend to continue to acquire primarily freestanding, single tenant retail properties net leased primarily to investment grade and other credit tenants on a medium-term basis. The acquisition of properties entails various risks, including the risks that our investments may not perform as we expect, that we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate our new acquisitions into our existing operations and that our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. Further, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other well capitalized real estate investors, including both publicly-traded REITs and private institutional investment funds, including ARC and its affiliates and other REITs and funds sponsored or advised by ARC or its affiliates, and these competitors may have greater financial resources than us and a greater ability to borrow funds and acquire properties. In particular, ARCT, an ARC-sponsored REIT for which Mr. Schorsch is the chairman of the board and Mr. Kahane is the president and chief executive officer, is a publicly traded REIT that also invests in net leased properties (although not primarily our target assets). As of March 1, 2012, ARCT market capitalization was $1.8 billion, more than 22 times our market capitalization as of such date, which means that ARCT is likely to have greater financial resources and significantly greater access to capital than we will have in order to acquire properties. This competition increases as investments in real estate become increasingly attractive relative to other forms of investment. As a result of competition, we may be unable to acquire additional properties as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly elevated. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or our OP or its subsidiaries and proceeds from property contributions and divestitures which may not be available and which could adversely affect our cash flows. Any of the above risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay distributions on, and the market price of, our common stock.10In addition, our growth strategy includes the disciplined acquisition of properties as opportunities arise. Our ability to acquire properties on satisfactory terms and successfully integrate and operate them is subject to the following significant risks:•we may be unable to acquire desired properties because of competition from other real estate investors with more capital, including other real estate operating companies, REITs and investment funds;•we may acquire properties that are not accretive to our results upon acquisition, and we may not successfully manage and lease those properties to meet our expectations;•competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price of a desired property;•we may be unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, or obtain the necessary debt or equity financing to consummate an acquisition or, if obtainable, financing may not be on satisfactory terms;•we may need to spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties;•agreements for the acquisition of properties are typically subject to customary conditions to closing, including satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations, and we may spend significant time and money on potential acquisitions that we do not consummate;•the process of acquiring or pursuing the acquisition of a new property may divert the attention of our Manager from our existing business operations;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations;•market conditions may result in future vacancies and lower-than-expected rental rates; and•we may acquire properties without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, for liabilities, whether known or unknown, such as cleanup of environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.If we cannot complete property acquisitions, including the proposed property acquisitions, on favorable terms, or operate acquired properties to meet our goals or expectations, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make dividends to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected.We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for dividend to our stockholders, per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.Because we compete with a number of real estate operators in connection with the leasing of our properties, the possibility exists that one or more of our tenants will extend or renew its lease with us when the lease term expires on terms that are less favorable to us than the terms of the then-expiring lease, or that such tenant or tenants will not renew at all. Because we depend, in large part, on rental payments from our tenants, if one or more tenants renews its lease on terms less favorable to us, does not renew its lease or we do not re-lease a significant portion of the space made available, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for dividend to our stockholders, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.11We are dependent on single-tenant leases for our revenue and, accordingly, lease terminations or tenant defaults could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We expect to focus our investment activities on ownership of freestanding, single-tenant commercial properties that are net leased to a single tenant. Therefore, the financial failure of, or other default in payment by, a single tenant under its lease is likely to cause a significant reduction in our operating cash flows from that property and a significant reduction in the value of the property, and could cause a significant reduction in our revenues. If a lease is terminated or defaulted on, we may experience difficulty or significant delay in re-leasing such property, or we may be unable to find a new tenant to re-lease the vacated space, which could result in us incurring a loss. The current economic conditions and the credit crisis may put financial pressure on and increase the likelihood of the financial failure of, or other default in payment by, one or more of the tenants to whom we have exposure.Because we lease our properties to a limited number of tenants, and to the extent we depend on a limited number of tenants in the future, failure by any major tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us, because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise, or the termination or non-renewal of a lease by a major tenant, would have a material adverse effect on us.As of December 31, 2011, we had 6 tenants (including for this purpose, all affiliates of such tenants) in our 90 properties, all of which are single-tenant properties. We expect to derive substantially all of our revenue from a limited number of tenants. Therefore, our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our tenants. While we evaluate the creditworthiness of our tenants by reviewing available financial and other pertinent information, there can be no assurance that any tenant will be able to make timely rental payments or avoid defaulting under its lease. At any time, our tenants may experience an adverse change in their business. For example, the recent downturn in the global economy already may have adversely affected, or may in the future adversely affect, one or more of our tenants. If any of our tenants' business experience significant adverse changes, they may decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close a number of stores, exercise early termination rights (to the extent such rights are available to the tenant) or declare bankruptcy. If a tenant defaults, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment.If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could result in the termination of the tenant's leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases. If a lease is terminated or defaulted on, we may be unable to find a new tenant to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. Furthermore, the consequences to us would be exacerbated if one of our major tenants were to experience an adverse development in their business that resulted in them being unable to make timely rental payments or to default under their lease. The occurrence of any of the situations described above would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.We rely significantly on two major tenants (including, for this purpose, all affiliates of such tenants) and therefore, are subject to tenant credit concentrations that make us more susceptible to adverse events with respect to those tenants.As of December 31, 2011, 84% of our annualized rental income is derived from two major tenants (including for this purpose, all affiliates of such tenants). Therefore, the financial failure of a major tenant is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. In addition, the value of our investment is historically driven by the credit quality of the underlying tenant, and an adverse change in a major tenant's financial condition or a decline in the credit rating of such tenant may result in a decline in the value of our investments and have a material adverse effect on our results from operations.Our net leases may require us to pay property-related expenses that are not the obligations of our tenants.Under the terms of all of our net leases, in addition to satisfying their rent obligations, our tenants are responsible for the payment of real estate taxes, insurance and ordinary maintenance and repairs. However, under the provisions of future leases with our tenants, we may be required to pay some expenses, such as the costs of environmental liabilities, roof and structural repairs, insurance, certain non-structural repairs and maintenance. If our properties incur significant expenses that must be paid by us under the terms of our leases, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected and the amount of cash available to meet expenses and to make dividends to holders of our common stock may be reduced.12Any of our properties that incurs a vacancy could be difficult to sell or re-lease.One or more of our properties may incur a vacancy either by the continued default of a tenant under its lease or the expiration of one of our leases. Certain of our properties may be specifically suited to the particular needs of a tenant (e.g., a retail bank branch or distribution warehouse) and major renovations and expenditures may be required in order for us to re-lease vacant space for other uses. We may have difficulty obtaining a new tenant for any vacant space we have in our properties, including our two presently vacant properties. If the vacancy continues for a long period of time, we may suffer reduced revenues resulting in less cash available to be distributed to stockholders. In addition, the resale value of a property could be diminished because the market value of a particular property will depend principally upon the value of the leases of such property.We are subject to tenant industry concentrations that make us more susceptible to adverse events with respect to certain industries.As of December 31, 2011, our tenants operate in five industries. Any downturn in one or more of these industries, or in any other industry in which we may have a significant credit concentration in the future, could result in a material reduction of our cash flows or material losses to our company.Our properties may be subject to impairment charges.We periodically evaluate our real estate investments for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions, tenant performance and legal structure. For example, the early termination of, or default under, a lease by a tenant may lead to an impairment charge. Since our investment focus is on properties net leased to a single tenant, the financial failure of, or other default in payment by, a single tenant under its lease may result in a significant impairment loss. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the property, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and FFO in the period in which the impairment charge is recorded.Our real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and therefore we may not be able to dispose of properties when appropriate or on favorable terms.The real estate investments made, and to be made, by us are relatively difficult to sell quickly. Return of capital and realization of gains, if any, from an investment generally will occur upon disposition or refinancing of a property. In addition, the Code imposes restrictions on the ability of a REIT to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. We may be unable to realize our investment objectives by disposition or refinancing of a property at attractive prices within any given period of time or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy. In particular, these risks could arise from weakness in or even the lack of an established market for a property, changes in the financial condition or prospects of prospective purchasers, changes in national or international economic conditions, and changes in laws, regulations or fiscal policies of jurisdictions in which the property is located.Our investments in properties backed by below investment grade credits will have a greater risk of default.As of December 31, 2011, 9.0% of our annualized rental income come is derived tenants who do not have credit ratings or are rated below investment grade by a major rating agency. We also may invest in other properties in the future where the underlying tenant's credit rating is below investment grade. These investments will have a greater risk of default and bankruptcy than investments in properties leased exclusively to investment grade tenants.Our investments in properties where the underlying tenant does not have a publicly available credit rating will expose us to certain risks.When we invest in properties where the underlying tenant does not have a publicly available credit rating, we will rely on our own estimates of the tenant's credit rating and usually subsequently obtain a private rating from a reputable credit rating agency to allow us to finance the property as we had planned. If our lender or a credit rating agency disagrees with our ratings estimates, or our ratings estimates are inaccurate, we may not be able to obtain our desired level of leverage or our financing costs may exceed those that we projected. This outcome could have an adverse impact on our returns on that asset and hence our operating results.13Operating expenses of our properties will reduce our cash flow and funds available for future dividends.For certain of our properties, we are responsible for operating costs of the property. In some of these instances, our leases require the tenant to reimburse us for all or a portion of these costs, either in the form of an expense reimbursement or increased rent. Our reimbursement may be limited to a fixed amount or a specified percentage annually. To the extent operating costs exceed our reimbursement, our returns and net cash flows from the property and hence our overall operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.We have greater exposure to operating costs with respect to properties leased to the United States Government.Subsequent to December 31, 2011, we acquired a property this is leased to the United States Government, and may acquire more in the future . Any leases with the United States Government generally will be typical Government Services Administration-type leases. These leases do not provide that the United States Government is wholly responsible for operating costs of the property, but include an operating cost component within the rent we receive that increases annually by an agreed upon percentage based upon the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. Thus, we will have greater exposure to operating costs on our properties leased to the United States Government, if any, because if the operating costs of the property increase faster than the CPI, we will bear those excess costs.We would face potential adverse effects from tenant defaults, bankruptcies or insolvencies.The bankruptcy of our tenants may adversely affect the income generated by our properties. If our tenant files for bankruptcy, we generally cannot evict the tenant solely because of such bankruptcy. In addition, a bankruptcy court could authorize a bankrupt tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. In such a case, our claim against the tenant for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and it is unlikely that a bankrupt tenant would pay in full amounts it owes us under the lease. Any shortfall resulting from the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.The price we paid for the assets we acquired in the formation transactions, all of which were purchased from the Contributor, an affiliate of our Sponsor, may have exceeded their aggregate fair market value.The amount of consideration we paid the Contributor, an affiliate of our Sponsor, for the properties we purchased in our initial formation transaction may have been greater than the value of such properties, as determined by a recent independent third-party investment valuation, because the amount of consideration for such properties was not determined as a result of arm's-length negotiations. Further, we have not obtained a recent appraisal of the fair market value of the properties nor solicited third-party bids for the properties for purposes of creating a market check on their value. Conflicts of interest existed in connection with the transaction in which interests in these properties were contributed to our operating partnership. There can be no assurance that the values reflected in the independent third-party investment valuation that we obtained reflect the fair market value of the properties were they to be sold in an arm's-length transaction. As a result, the price paid by us for the acquisition of the assets in the formation transactions may have exceeded the fair market value of those assets. The aggregate historical combined net book value of the real estate assets acquired by us in the formation transactions was $109.5 million.We assumed liabilities in connection with the formation transactions, including unknown liabilities.As part of the formation transactions, we assumed existing liabilities of our property subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, liabilities in connection with our properties, some of which may have been unknown or unquantifiable at the time the formation transactions were consummated. Unknown liabilities might include liabilities for cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, claims of tenants or other persons dealing with the entities prior to the consummation of the formation transactions, tax liabilities, employment-related issues, and accrued but unpaid liabilities whether incurred in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. If the magnitude of such unknown liabilities is high, either singly or in the aggregate, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make dividends to our stockholders.14We face intense competition, which may decrease or prevent increases in the occupancy and rental rates of our properties.We compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of retail, industrial and office real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. If one of our properties becomes vacant and our competitors (which would include ARC or any ARC-sponsored program) offer space at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose existing or potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge or to offer substantial rent abatements. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected.Our operating performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.Our real estate investments are subject to various risks and fluctuations and cycles in value and demand, many of which are beyond our control. Certain events may decrease cash available for dividends, as well as the value of our properties. These events include, but are not limited to:•adverse changes in international, national or local economic and demographic conditions such as the recent global economic downturn;•vacancies or our inability to rent space on favorable terms, including possible market pressures to offer tenants rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or tenant-favorable renewal options;•adverse changes in financial conditions of buyers, sellers and tenants of properties;•inability to collect rent from tenants;•competition from other real estate investors with significant capital, including other real estate operating companies, REITs and institutional investment funds;•reductions in the level of demand for commercial space generally, and freestanding net leased properties specifically, and changes in the relative popularity of our properties;•increases in the supply of freestanding single-tenant properties;•fluctuations in interest rates, which could adversely affect our ability, or the ability of buyers and tenants of our properties, to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;•increases in expenses, including, but not limited to, insurance costs, labor costs, energy prices, real estate assessments and other taxes and costs of compliance with laws, regulations and governmental policies, all of which have an adverse impact on the rent a tenant may be willing to pay us in order to lease one or more of our properties; and•changes in, and changes in enforcement of, laws, regulations and governmental policies, including, without limitation, health, safety, environmental, zoning and tax laws, governmental fiscal policies and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession, such as the recent global economic downturn, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults under existing leases. If we cannot operate our properties to meet our financial expectations, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make dividends to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our return objectives.15A potential change in U.S. accounting standards regarding operating leases may make the leasing of our properties less attractive to our potential tenants, which could reduce overall demand for our leasing services.Under current authoritative accounting guidance for leases, a lease is classified by a tenant as a capital lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered to reside with the tenant. Under capital lease accounting for a tenant, both the leased asset and liability are reflected on their balance sheet. If the lease does not meet any of the criteria for a capital lease, the lease is considered an operating lease by the tenant, and the obligation does not appear on the tenant's balance sheet; rather, the contractual future minimum payment obligations are only disclosed in the footnotes thereto. Thus, entering into an operating lease can appear to enhance a tenant's balance sheet in comparison to direct ownership. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board, or the IASB, conducted a joint project to re-evaluate lease accounting. In August 2010, the FASB and the IASB jointly released exposure drafts of a proposed accounting model that would significantly change lease accounting. The final standards are expected to be issued in 2012. Changes to the accounting guidance could affect both our accounting for leases as well as that of our current and potential tenants. These changes may affect how our real estate leasing business is conducted. For example, if the accounting standards regarding the financial statement classification of operating leases are revised, then companies may be less willing to enter into leases with us in general or desire to enter into leases with us with shorter terms because the apparent benefits to their balance sheets could be reduced or eliminated. This in turn could cause a delay in investing our offering proceeds and make it more difficult for us to enter into leases on terms we find favorable.We will rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs, and if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital, we may not be able to make future acquisitions necessary to grow our business or meet maturing obligations.In order to qualify as a REIT under the Code, we will be required, among other things, to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. Because of this dividend requirement, we may not be able to fund, from cash retained from operations, all of our future capital needs, including capital needed to make investments and to satisfy or refinance maturing obligations.We expect to rely on external sources of capital, including debt and equity financing, to fund future capital needs. However, the recent U.S. and global economic slowdown has resulted in a capital environment characterized by limited availability, increasing costs and significant volatility. If we are unable to obtain needed capital on satisfactory terms or at all, we may not be able to make the investments needed to expand our business, or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature.Any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage. Our access to capital will depend upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including:•general market conditions;•the market's perception of our growth potential;•our current debt levels;•our current and expected future earnings;•our cash flow and cash dividends; and•the market price per share of our common stock.We may not be in a position to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities for growth if we are unable to access the capital markets on a timely basis on favorable terms.16Our ability to sell equity to expand our business will depend, in part, on the market price of our common stock, and our failure to meet market expectations with respect to our business could negatively affect the market price of our common stock and limit our ability to sell equity.The availability of equity capital to us will depend, in part, on the market price of our common stock, which, in turn, will depend upon various market conditions and other factors that may change from time to time, including:•the extent of investor interest;•our ability to satisfy the dividend requirements applicable to REITs;•the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies;•our financial performance and that of our tenants;•analyst reports about us and the REIT industry;•general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed-income securities, which may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends;•a failure to maintain or increase our dividend, which is dependent, to a large part, on FFO, which, in turn, depends upon increased revenue from additional acquisitions and rental increases; and•other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in REIT tax laws.Our failure to meet market expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, as a result, the availability of equity capital to us.We have substantial amounts of indebtedness outstanding, which may affect our ability to make dividends, may expose us to interest rate fluctuation risk and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.As of December 31, 2011, our aggregate indebtedness was approximately $72.7 million. We may incur significant additional debt for various purposes including, without limitation, the funding of future acquisitions, capital improvements and leasing commissions in connection with the repositioning of a property.17Payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to make the dividends currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. Our substantial outstanding indebtedness, and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements, could have other significant adverse consequences, including as follows:•our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;•we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on satisfactory terms, which could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to capitalize upon emerging acquisition opportunities or meet needs to fund capital improvements and leasing commissions;•we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;•we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms;•we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations;•certain of the property subsidiaries' loan documents may include restrictions on such subsidiary's ability to make dividends to us;•we may be unable to hedge floating-rate debt, counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under our hedge agreements, these agreements may not effectively hedge interest rate fluctuation risk, and, upon the expiration of any hedge agreements, we would be exposed to then-existing market rates of interest and future interest rate volatility;•we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases; and•our default under any of our indebtedness with cross-default provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness.If any one of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make dividends to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any foreclosure on our properties could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, which could adversely affect our ability to meet the REIT dividend requirements imposed by the Code.Our existing loan agreements contain, and future financing arrangements will likely contain, restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to make dividends to our stockholders.We are subject to certain restrictions pursuant to the restrictive covenants of our outstanding indebtedness, which may affect our dividend and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt. Loan documents evidencing our existing indebtedness contain, and loan documents entered into in the future will likely contain, certain operating covenants that limit our ability to further mortgage the property or discontinue insurance coverage. In addition, future agreements may contain, and any future company credit facilities likely will contain, financial covenants, including certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt, make dividends, sell all or substantially all of our assets, and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. Specifically, our ability to make dividends may be limited by our senior secured revolving credit facility, pursuant to which our dividends may not exceed the greater of (i) 95.0% of our AFFO or (ii) the amount required for us to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT. Covenants under any future indebtedness may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions. In addition, failure to meet any of these covenants, including the financial coverage ratios, could cause an event of default under or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us.Increases in interest rates would increase the amount of our variable-rate debt payments and could limit our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.Indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility is subject to, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future subject to, floating interest rates, and as a result, increases in interest rates on such indebtedness would reduce our cash flows and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. In addition, if we are required to repay existing debt during periods of higher interest rates, we may need to sell one or more of our investments in order to repay the debt, which might reduce the realization of the return on such investments.18Our organizational documents have no limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. As a result, we may become highly leveraged in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition.Our business strategy contemplates the use of both secured and unsecured debt to finance long-term growth. While we intend to limit our indebtedness to maintain an overall net debt to gross asset value of approximately 45% to 55%, provided that we may exceed this amount for individual properties in select cases where attractive financing is available, our governing documents contain no limitations on the amount of debt that we may incur, and our Board of Directors may change our financing policy at any time without stockholder approval. As a result, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could result in an increase in our debt service and harm our financial condition.Adverse global market and economic conditions may continue to adversely affect us and could cause us to recognize impairment charges or otherwise harm our performance.Recent market and economic conditions have been challenging, with tighter credit conditions in 2008 through 2011. Continued concerns about the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, inflation, unemployment levels, geopolitical issues and declining equity and real estate markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the U.S. economy. The commercial real estate sector in particular has been adversely affected by these market and economic conditions. These conditions may result in our tenants requesting rent reductions, declining to extend or renew leases upon expiration or renewing at lower rates. These conditions also have forced tenants, in some cases, to declare bankruptcy or vacate leased premises. We may be unable to re-lease vacated space at attractive rents or at all. We are unable to predict whether, or to what extent or for how long, these adverse market and economic conditions will persist. The continuation or intensification of these conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses, maintain properties, make dividends and repay debt.Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows, and there can be no assurance as to future costs and the scope of coverage that may be available under insurance policies.We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket insurance policy with policy specifications, limits and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties. In addition, we carry professional liability and directors' and officers' insurance. We have selected policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. We do not carry insurance for certain losses, including, but not limited to, losses caused by riots or war. Certain types of losses may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, such as losses due to earthquakes, riots or acts of war. Should an uninsured loss occur, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property. If any such loss is insured, we may be required to pay a significant deductible on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss, or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss. In addition, future lenders may require such insurance, and our failure to obtain such insurance could constitute a default under our loan agreements. In addition, we may reduce or discontinue terrorism, earthquake, flood or other insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any of these policies exceeds, in our judgment, the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss. Our title insurance policies may not insure for the current aggregate market value of our portfolio, and we do not intend to increase our title insurance coverage as the market value of our portfolio increases. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make dividends to our stockholders may be materially and adversely affected.If we or one or more of our tenants experiences a loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.If any of our insurance carriers becomes insolvent, we could be adversely affected.We carry several different lines of insurance, placed with several large insurance carriers. If any one of these large insurance carriers were to become insolvent, we would be forced to replace the existing insurance coverage with another suitable carrier, and any outstanding claims would be at risk for collection. In such an event, we cannot be certain that we would be able to replace the coverage at similar or otherwise favorable terms. Replacing insurance coverage at unfavorable rates and the potential of uncollectible claims due to carrier insolvency could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.19Terrorism and other factors affecting demand for our properties could harm our operating results.The strength and profitability of our business depends on demand for and the value of our properties. Future terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the attacks that occurred in New York and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001, and other acts of terrorism or war could have a negative impact on our operations. Such terrorist attacks could have an adverse impact on our business even if they are not directed at our properties. In addition, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 have substantially affected the availability and price of insurance coverage for certain types of damages or occurrences, and our insurance policies for terrorism include large deductibles and co-payments. The lack of sufficient insurance for these types of acts could expose us to significant losses and could have a negative impact on our operations.We may be required to make significant capital expenditures to improve our properties in order to retain and attract tenants, causing a decline in operating revenue and reducing cash available for debt service and dividends to stockholders.If adverse economic conditions continue in the real estate market and demand for freestanding single tenant properties remains low, we expect that, upon expiration of leases at our properties, we will be required to make rent or other concessions to tenants, or accommodate requests for renovations, build-to-suit remodeling and other improvements. As a result, we may have to make significant capital or other expenditures in order to retain tenants whose leases expire and to attract new tenants. Additionally, we may need to raise capital to make such expenditures. If we are unable to do so or capital is otherwise unavailable, we may be unable to make the required expenditures. This could result in non-renewals by tenants upon expiration of their leases, which would result in declines in revenue from operations and reduce cash available for debt service and dividends to stockholders.Difficult conditions in the commercial real estate markets may cause us to experience market losses related to our holdings, and these conditions may not improve in the near future.Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the real estate markets, the financial markets and the economy generally and may cause commercial real estate values, including the values of our properties, and market rental rates, including rental rates that we are able to charge, to decline significantly. Current economic and credit market conditions have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for real estate markets, as well as adversely impacted inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues and the availability and cost of credit, and will continue to do so going forward. The further deterioration of the real estate market may cause us to record losses on our assets, reduce the proceeds we receive upon sale or refinance of our assets or adversely impact our ability to lease our properties. Declines in the market values of our properties may adversely affect our results of operations and credit availability, which may reduce earnings and, in turn, cash available for dividends to our stockholders. Current economic and credit market conditions may also cause one or more of the tenants to whom we have exposure to fail or default in their payment obligations, which could cause us to record material losses or a material reduction in our cash flows.Because we own real property, we are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.Environmental laws regulate, and impose liability for, releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Under various provisions of these laws, an owner or operator of real estate, such as us, is or may be liable for costs related to soil or groundwater contamination on, in, or migrating to or from its property. In addition, persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination at the disposal site. Such laws often impose liability regardless of whether the person knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances that caused the contamination. The presence of, or contamination resulting from, any of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate them, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our property or to borrow using such property as collateral. In addition, persons exposed to hazardous or toxic substances may sue us for personal injury damages. For example, certain laws impose liability for release of or exposure to asbestos-containing materials and contamination from past operations or from off-site sources. As a result, in connection with our current or former ownership, operation, management and development of real properties, we may be potentially liable for investigation and cleanup costs, penalties, and damages under environmental laws.Although all of our properties were, at the time they were acquired by our predecessor, subjected to preliminary environmental assessments, known as Phase I assessments, by independent environmental consultants that identify certain liabilities, Phase I assessments are limited in scope, and may not include or identify all potential environmental liabilities or risks associated with the property. Further, any environmental liabilities that arose since the date the studies were done would not be identified in the assessments. Unless required by applicable laws or regulations, we may not further investigate, remedy or ameliorate the liabilities disclosed in the Phase I assessments.20We cannot assure you that these or other environmental studies identified all potential environmental liabilities, or that we will not incur material environmental liabilities in the future. If we do incur material environmental liabilities in the future, we may face significant remediation costs, and we may find it difficult to sell any affected properties.As a result of becoming a public company, we implemented additional financial and accounting systems, procedures and controls which are applicable to such companies, which has increased our costs and requires substantial management time and attention.As a public company, we have incurred, and in the future will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses that our predecessor did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements and corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As an example, in order to comply with such reporting requirements, we are evaluating our internal control systems in order to allow management to report on, and, when required, our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail to implement proper overall business controls, including as required to integrate the property subsidiaries and support our growth, our results of operations could be harmed or we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, if we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, or if we are unable to receive an unqualified report from our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and the trading price of our common stock and our ability to obtain any necessary equity or debt financing could suffer.Furthermore, the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements, or misrepresentations. Although management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weaknesses, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in the trading price of our common stock, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.Payment of fees to our Manager and ARC reduces cash available for investment and dividend.Our Manager and ARC will perform services for us in connection with the selection, acquisition, financing, leasing and management of us and our properties. Our Manager and ARC will be paid substantial fees for these services, which reduce the amount of cash available for investment in properties or dividend to stockholders. Such fees and reimbursements include: (i) a management fee payable to our Manager equal to 0.50% per annum of our average unadjusted book value of our real estate assets, calculated and payable monthly in advance, provided that the full amount of the dividends declared by us in respect of our OP units for the six immediately preceding months is equal to or greater than the amount of our AFFO; (ii) incentive fees equal to the difference between (1) the product of (x) 20% and (y) the difference between (I) our Core Earnings (as defined below) for the previous 12-month period, and (II) the product of (A) the weighted average of the issue price per share of our common stock of all of our public offerings multiplied by the weighted average number of all shares of common stock outstanding (including any restricted shares of common stock and other shares of common stock underlying awards granted under our equity incentive plans) in the previous 12-month period, and (B) 8.00%, and (2) the sum of any incentive fee paid to our Manager with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such previous 12-month period; provided, however, that no incentive fee is payable with respect to any calendar quarter unless Core Earnings for the 12 most recently completed calendar quarters is greater than zero; (iii) an acquisition fee payable to ARC equal to 1.0% of the contract purchase price (including assumed indebtedness) of each property that we acquire which is originated by ARC; (iv) a financing fee payable to ARC equal to 0.75% of the amount available under any secured mortgage financing or refinancing that we obtain and use for the acquisition of properties that is arranged by ARC; and (v) reimbursement for all out of pocket costs actually incurred by ARC in connection with the performance of services under the acquisition and capital services agreement, including without limitation, legal fees and expenses, due diligence fees and expenses, other third party fees and expenses, costs of appraisals, travel expenses, nonrefundable option payments and deposits on properties not acquired, accounting fees and expenses, title insurance premiums and other closing costs, personnel costs and miscellaneous expenses relating to the selection, acquisition and due diligence of properties. Also, in the future we may contract with ARC to perform property management and leasing services with respect to our properties in respect of which we will pay fees equal to 1.5% of gross revenues from such properties plus certain expense reimbursements.21We used some of the proceeds from future equity offerings to repay indebtedness owed to affiliates or incurred pursuant to affiliated debt programs.To the extent we borrow money from affiliates or pursuant to affiliated debt programs in the future, we may use proceeds from future equity offerings to repay such indebtedness.Risks Related to Our Relationship with Our Manager and ARCWe are dependent on ARC and its key personnel, especially Messrs. Schorsch, Budko, Block and Weil, who provide services to us through the management agreement and the acquisition and capital services agreement, and we may not find a suitable replacement for our Manager and ARC if the management agreement and the acquisition and capital services agreement is terminated, or for these key personnel if they leave ARC or otherwise become unavailable to us.We have no separate facilities and are completely reliant on our Manager and ARC. Our chief executive officer, our president, our executive vice president and chief investment officer and our other executive officer are executives of ARC. We do not have and do not expect to have any employees. Our Manager and ARC have significant discretion as to the implementation of our investment and operating policies and strategies. Accordingly, we believe that our success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts, experience, diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the officers and key personnel of our Manager and ARC. The officers and key personnel of our Manager and ARC will evaluate, negotiate, close and monitor our investments; therefore, our success will depend on their continued service. The departure of any of the officers or key personnel of our Manager could have a material adverse effect on our performance and slow our future growth. We have not obtained and do not expect to obtain “key person” life insurance on any of our key personnel.Neither our Manager nor ARC is obligated to dedicate any specific personnel exclusively to us. In addition, none of our officers or the officers of our Manager or ARC are obligated to dedicate any specific portion of their time to our business. Each of them has significant responsibilities for other investment vehicles currently managed by affiliates of ARC, including as a result of being part of the senior management or key personnel of, including our business as of December 31, 2011, 10 ARC-sponsored investment programs and their advisors including eight REITS and two Registered Investment Companies ("RIC"). One of the ARC-sponsored REITs and one RIC have registration statements that are not yet effective and are in the development phase. As a result, such REITs and RICs will have concurrent or overlapping fundraising, acquisition and operational phases as us, which may cause conflicts of interest to arise throughout the life of our company. Additionally, based on our Sponsor's experience, a significantly greater time commitment is required of senior management during the development stage when entity is being organized, funds are initially being raised and funds are initially being invested, and less time is required as additional funds are raised and the offering matures. As a result, these individuals may not always be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business. Further, when there are turbulent conditions in the real estate markets or distress in the credit markets, the attention of our Manager's and ARC's personnel and our executive officers and the resources of ARC will also be required by the other investment vehicles managed by affiliates of ARC. In such situations, we may not receive the level of support and assistance that we may receive if we were internally managed.In addition, we offer no assurance that our Manager will remain our investment manager or that we will continue to have access to ARC to provide us with acquisition and capital services following the initial term of the acquisition and capital services agreement. The initial term of our management agreement with our Manager and the acquisition and capital services agreement between us and ARC extends until September 6, 2021, which is the tenth anniversary of the closing of our IPO, with automatic one-year renewals thereafter of our management agreement and our acquisition and capital services agreement, subject to a 180-day prior written notice of termination period. If the management agreement is terminated or the acquisition and capital services agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found to provide the services needed by us under those agreements, we may not be able to execute our business plan.22There are various conflicts of interest in our relationship with ARC and our Manager, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.We are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with ARC and our Manager. Specifically, Mr. Schorsch, our chief executive officer and the chairman of our Board of Directors, Mr. Weil, our president, chief operating officer, secretary and one of our Directors, Mr. Budko, our executive vice president and chief investment officer, and Mr. Block, our executive vice president and chief financial officer, are executives of ARC. Our Manager and executive officers may have conflicts between their duties to us and their duties to, and interests in, ARC and other ARC-sponsored programs. Our ability to make investments in our target assets is governed by an acquisition and capital services agreement with ARC. Our acquisition and capital services agreement with ARC provides that no entity controlled by ARC or its affiliates, including executives of ARC, will sponsor or manage any public or private U.S. investment vehicle that has as its principal investment strategy to invest in net leased properties that are subject to leases that have remaining terms of less than 10 years but not less than three years other than us for so long as either Mr. Schorsch or Mr. William M. Kahane are directly or indirectly affiliated with our Manager and our management agreement is in effect. However, ARC and its affiliates may sponsor or manage another public or private U.S. investment vehicle that invests generally in real estate assets but not primarily in our target assets, including net leased properties.Our Board of Directors has adopted a policy with respect to any proposed investments by our directors or officers or the officers of our Manager, which we refer to as the covered persons, in our target properties. This policy provides that any proposed investment by a covered person for his or her own account in any of our target properties will be permitted if the capital required for the investment does not exceed the lesser of (i) $5 million, or (ii) 1% of our total stockholders' equity as of the most recent month end, or the personal investment limit. To the extent that a proposed investment exceeds the personal investment limit, our Board of Directors will only permit the covered person to make the investment (i) upon the approval of the disinterested directors, or (ii) if the proposed investment otherwise complies with terms of any other related party transaction policy our Board of Directors may adopt in the future. Subject to compliance with all applicable laws, these individuals may make investments for their own account in our target properties which may present certain conflicts of interest not addressed by our current policies.We may acquire properties in geographic areas where ARC or other ARC Funds own competing properties. Also, we may acquire properties from, or sell properties to, ARC or other ARC-sponsored programs. If ARC or any one of the other ARC-sponsored programs attracts a tenant that we are competing for, we could suffer a loss of revenue due to delays in locating another suitable tenant.We will pay our Manager and ARC substantial management fees, incentive fees, acquisition fees and financing fees and may, in the future, pay them property management fees, most of which are payable regardless of the performance of our portfolio. Our Manager's and ARC's entitlement to such fees, which are not based upon performance metrics or goals, might reduce their incentive to devote their time and effort to seeking investments that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our portfolio. Additionally, because of the payment of acquisition fees and financing fees to ARC with respect to properties acquired and financings obtained, ARC may attempt to cause us to acquire properties and incur financings in order to earn these fees. This in turn could hurt both our ability to make dividends to our stockholders and the market price of our common stock.Concurrently with the completion of our IPO, we granted to our Manager 167,400 restricted shares of Manager's Stock, which is equal to 3.0% of the number of shares sold in our IPO. This award will vest ratably in quarterly installments over a three-year period beginning on October 1, 2011. Once vested, to the extent our Manager sells some of the shares, its interests may be less aligned with our interests.Each of the management agreement with our Manager and the acquisition and capital services agreement with ARC was not negotiated on an arm's-length basis and may not be as favorable to us as if each agreement had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party and each agreement may be costly and difficult to terminate.Our executive officers and two of our five directors are executives of ARC. Each of our management agreement with our Manager and the acquisition and capital services agreement with ARC was negotiated between related parties and their terms, including amounts payable under each agreement and the term of each agreement, which exceeds the term of most other externally advised REITs, may not be as favorable to us as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.23Termination of the management agreement with our Manager and the acquisition and capital services agreement with ARC without cause is difficult. During the initial term of the management agreement, the management agreement may be terminated by us only for cause. Following the initial ten-year term (which commenced on September 6, 2011), the management agreement may be terminated annually upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors based upon: (1) our Manager's unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us, or (2) a determination that the management fees payable to our Manager are not fair, subject to our Manager's right to prevent termination based on unfair fees by accepting a reduction of management fees agreed to by at least two-thirds of our independent directors. Our Manager will be provided 180 days prior written notice of any such termination. Additionally, the acquisition and capital services agreement with ARC has a ten-year term (which commenced on September 6, 2011) and then continues on a yearly basis thereafter subject to 180 days prior written notice of any termination. These provisions may adversely affect our ability to terminate our Manager and ARC without cause.Both our Manager and ARC are only contractually committed to serve us until September 6, 2021, which is the tenth anniversary of the closing of our IPO. Thereafter, the management agreement and the acquisition and capital services agreement are each renewable for one-year terms; provided, however, that (1) our Manager may terminate the management agreement annually upon 180 days prior written notice and (2) ARC may terminate the acquisition and capital services agreement annually upon 180 days prior written notice. If the management agreement is terminated or the acquisition and capital services agreement is terminated and, in each case, no suitable replacement is found to manage us or provide acquisition and capital services to us, we may not be able to execute our business plan.Pursuant to each of the management agreement and the acquisition and capital services agreement, neither our Manager nor ARC will assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder and neither will be responsible for any action of our Board of Directors in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. Each of our Manager and ARC maintains a contractual as opposed to a fiduciary relationship with us. Under the terms of the management agreement and the acquisition and capital services agreement, none of our Manager, ARC, or any of their respective officers, members or personnel, any person controlling or controlled by our Manager or ARC or any person providing sub-advisory services to our Manager or ARC will be liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our directors, our stockholders or any subsidiary's stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the management agreement or the acquisition and capital services agreement, except because of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of their duties under the management agreement or the acquisition and capital services agreement. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify our Manager, ARC and each of their respective officers, stockholders, members, managers, directors and personnel, any person controlling or controlled by our Manager or ARC and any person providing sub-advisory services to our Manager or ARC with respect to all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims arising from acts or omissions of our Manager or ARC not constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of duties, performed in good faith in accordance with and pursuant to the management agreement or the acquisition and capital services agreement.The incentive fee payable to our Manager under the management agreement is payable quarterly and is based on our Core Earnings and therefore, may cause our Manager to select investments in more risky assets to increase its incentive compensation.Our Manager is entitled to receive incentive compensation based upon our achievement of targeted levels of Core Earnings. In evaluating investments and other management strategies, the opportunity to earn incentive compensation based on Core Earnings may lead our Manager to place undue emphasis on the maximization of Core Earnings at the expense of other criteria, such as preservation of capital, in order to achieve higher incentive compensation. Investments with higher yield potential are generally riskier or more speculative. This could result in increased risk to the value of our investment portfolio.24The conflicts of interest policy we have adopted may not adequately address all of the conflicts of interest that may arise with respect to our investment activities and also may limit the allocation of investments to us.In order to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our Manager, ARC or any of the ARC parties, we have adopted a conflicts of interest policy to specifically address some of the conflicts relating to our investment opportunities. Although under this policy the approval of a majority of our independent directors will be required to approve (i) any purchase of our assets by any of the ARC parties and (ii) any purchase by us of any assets of any of the ARC parties, there is no assurance that this policy will be adequate to address all of the conflicts that may arise or will address such conflicts in a manner that is favorable to us. In addition, as a result of the investment opportunity allocation provisions applicable to us, other ARC Funds may in the future, participate in some of our investments. Participating investments will not be the result of arm's length negotiations and will involve potential conflicts between our interests and those of the other participating ARC Funds in obtaining favorable terms. Since our executives are also executives of ARC, the same personnel may determine the price and terms for the investments for both us and these ARC Funds and there can be no assurance that any procedural protections, such as obtaining market prices or other reliable indicators of fair market value, will prevent the consideration we pay for these investments from exceeding their fair market value or ensure that we receive terms for a particular investment opportunity that are as favorable as those available from an independent third party.Risks Related to Our Organization and StructureThe supermajority voting requirements applicable to our Board of Directors in connection with our consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or our engaging in a share exchange will limit our independent directors' ability to influence such corporate matters.Our charter provides that we may not consolidate, merge, sell all or substantially all of our assets or engage in a share exchange, unless such actions are approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our Board of Directors. As a result, at least one of our directors who is also an executive of ARC will have to approve such significant corporate transactions. This concentrated control limits the ability of our independent directors to influence such corporate matters and could delay, deter or prevent a change of control transaction that might otherwise involve a premium for our shares of common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a result, our directors who are also executive of ARC may block certain transactions that our independent directors otherwise view as being in the best interests of our stockholders. Additionally, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected because of the such imbalance of control.Our Sponsor exercised significant influence with respect to the terms of the formation transactions, including transactions in which it determined the compensation our principals ultimately received.We did not conduct arm's-length negotiations with our Sponsor with respect to the formation transactions. In the course of structuring the formation transactions, our Sponsor had the ability to influence the type and level of benefits that it, its affiliates (including our principals and our Manager) and our other officers ultimately received from us. In addition, our principals had substantial pre-existing indirect ownership interests in the property subsidiaries that we acquired in the formation transactions and received substantial economic benefits as a result of the formation transactions. In addition, our principals have certain executive management and director positions with us, our Manager and ARC, for which they will receive certain other benefits such as any profits associated with the fees earned by our Manager and ARC and equity-based awards.Our charter, the partnership agreement of our operating partnership and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change of control transaction.Our charter contains a 9.8% ownership limit. Our charter, subject to certain exceptions, limits any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of stock and not more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of our shares of stock. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion and upon receipt of certain representations and undertakings, may exempt a person (prospectively or retroactively) from the ownership limits. However, our Board of Directors may not, among other limitations, grant an exemption from the ownership limits to any person whose ownership, direct or indirect, in excess of the 9.8% ownership limit would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Consistent with our charter, our Board of Directors has further limited such ownership of our stock (other than by our Sponsor) to no more than 5.25% in value of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of stock and not more than 5.25% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of our shares of stock. The ownership limits and the other restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock contained in our charter may delay or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. 25Tax protection provisions on certain properties could limit our operating flexibility.We have agreed with the Contributor, an affiliate of our Sponsor, to indemnify it against adverse tax consequences if we were to sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of the interests in the continuing properties acquired by us in the formation transactions, in a taxable transaction. However, we can sell these properties in a taxable transaction if we pay the Contributor cash in the amount of its tax liabilities arising from the transaction and tax payments. These tax protection provisions apply until September 6, 2021, which is the tenth anniversary of the closing of our IPO. Although it may be in our stockholders' best interest that we sell a property, it may be economically disadvantageous for us to do so because of these obligations. We have also agreed to make debt available for the Contributor to guarantee. We agreed to these provisions in order to assist the Contributor in preserving its tax position after its contribution of its interests in the continuing properties. As a result, we may be required to incur and maintain more debt than we would otherwise.We may pursue less vigorous enforcement of certain agreements because of conflicts of interest with certain of our directors and officers.Our principals and certain of our other executive officers and employees had indirect interests in all of the property subsidiaries that we acquired in the formation transactions, which property subsidiaries entered into the contribution agreement and other agreements with us in connection with such acquisitions. We may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under these agreements due to our ongoing relationship with our principals and our other executive officers.Tax consequences to holders of OP units upon a sale or refinancing of our properties may cause the interests of our principals to differ from the interests of our other stockholders.As a result of the unrealized built-in gain that may be attributable to one or more of the contributed properties at the time of contribution, some holders of OP units, including the Contributor, an affiliate of our Sponsor, may experience different tax consequences than holders of our common stock upon the sale or refinancing of the properties owned by our operating partnership, including disproportionately greater allocations of items of taxable income and gain upon a realization event. As those holders will not receive a correspondingly greater distribution of cash proceeds, they may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing, timing and other material terms of any sale or refinancing of certain properties, or whether to sell or refinance such properties at all, than those that would be in the best interests of our stockholders taken as a whole.Our Sponsor, the Contributor and our principals will have significant influence over our affairs.Our Sponsor and its affiliates hold a substantial percentage of the shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2011, the Contributor, an affiliate of our Sponsor, owns 310,000 OP units, which are convertible into 310,000 shares of our common stock, our Manager, which is wholly owned by our Sponsor, owns 167,400 shares of Manager's Stock, which will vest ratably in quarterly installments over a three-year period beginning on October 1, 2011, ARCT, an ARC-sponsored REIT whose shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for which Mr. Schorsch is the chairman of the board and Mr. Kahane is the president and chief executive officer , owns 282,000 shares of our common stock, and our Sponsor owns 1,629,669 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2011, (i) the Contributor owns approximately 4.1% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis, (ii) our Manager owns approximately 2.2% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis, (iii) ARCT owns approximately 3.7% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis and (iv) our Sponsor owns approximately 21.3% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. If the Contributor exercises its redemption rights with respect to its OP units and we issue common stock in exchange therefor, and all of the restricted shares granted to our Manager vest, our Sponsor, through its ownership of our common stock, affiliation with the Contributor, ownership and control of our Manager, and together with ARCT, will own collectively approximately 31.3% (for beneficial ownership purposes, but not for purposes of the 28.0% ownership limitation of our Sponsor and its affiliates) of our common stock on a fully diluted basis. In such an instance, our Sponsor and ARCT will have influence over our affairs and could exercise such influence in a manner that is not in the best interests of our other stockholders, including by attempting to delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. In addition, two principals of ARC serve on our Board of Directors. These indicia of control are in addition to the control our Sponsor, our executive officers, who also are members of our Sponsor, and our principals will have over our affairs attributable to their direct and indirect ownership interests in our Manager.26We are a holding company with no direct operations. As a result, we will rely on funds received from our operating partnership to pay liabilities and dividends, our stockholders' claims will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our operating partnership and our stockholders will not have any voting rights with respect to our operating partnership's activities, including the issuance of additional OP units.We are a holding company and will conduct all of our operations through our operating partnership. We do not have, apart from our ownership of our operating partnership, any independent operations. As a result, we will rely on distributions from our operating partnership to pay any dividends we might declare on shares of our common stock. We will also rely on distributions from our operating partnership to meet any of our obligations, including tax liability on taxable income allocated to us from our operating partnership (which might make distributions to the company not equal to the tax on such allocated taxable income).In addition, because we are a holding company, stockholders' claims will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for borrowed money) of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, claims of our stockholders will be satisfied only after all of our and our operating partnership's and its subsidiaries' liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.As of December 31, 2011, we owned approximately 95.9% of the OP units in our operating partnership. However, our operating partnership may issue additional OP units in the future. Such issuances could reduce our ownership percentage in our operating partnership. Because our common stockholders will not directly own any OP units, they will not have any voting rights with respect to any such issuances or other partnership-level activities of our operating partnership.Our Board of Directors may create and issue a class or series of common or preferred stock without stockholder approval.Our Board of Directors is empowered under our charter to amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of our stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue, to designate and issue from time to time one or more classes or series of stock and to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors may determine the relative preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of any class or series of stock issued. As a result, we may issue series or classes of stock with voting rights, rights to dividends or other rights, senior to the rights of holders of our common stock. The issuance of any such stock could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.Certain provisions in the partnership agreement of our operating partnership may delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions of us.Provisions in the partnership agreement of our operating partnership may delay or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions of us or changes in our control. These provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition of us or change of our control, although some stockholders might consider such proposals, if made, desirable. These provisions include, among others:•redemption rights of qualifying parties;•transfer restrictions on the OP units;•the ability of the general partner in some cases to amend the partnership agreement without the consent of the limited partners;•the right of the limited partners to consent to transfers of the general partnership interest of the general partner and mergers or consolidations of our company under specified limited circumstances; and•restrictions relating to our qualification as a REIT under the Code.Our charter and bylaws and the partnership agreement of our operating partnership also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. 27Certain rights which are reserved to our stockholders may allow third parties to enter into business combinations with us that are not in the best interest of the stockholders, without negotiating with our Board of Directors.Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or the MGCL, may have the effect of requiring a third party seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our Board of Directors, including:•“business combination” provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an “interested stockholder” (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of our company who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding stock) or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes special appraisal rights and stockholder supermajority voting requirements on these combinations; and•“control share” provisions that provide that “control shares” of our company (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a “control share acquisition” (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding “control shares”) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.As permitted by the MGCL, our Board of Directors has by resolution exempted business combinations (1) between us and any person, provided that such business combination is first approved by our Board of Directors (including a majority of directors who are not affiliates or associates of such person) and (2) between us and our Sponsor, our Manager, our operating partnership or any of their respective affiliates. Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to such business combinations. As a result, any person described above may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders without compliance by us with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the statute. This resolution, however, may be altered or repealed in whole or in part at any time by our Board of Directors. If this resolution is repealed, or our Board of Directors does not otherwise approve a business combination with a person other than our Sponsor, our Manager, our operating partnership or any of their respective affiliates, the statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.Pursuant to a provision in our bylaws, we have opted out of the control share provisions of the MGCL. However, we may, by amendment to our bylaws, opt in to the control shares provisions of the MGCL in the future.Additionally, Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain takeover defenses, such as a classified board, some of which we do not yet have. These provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us under the circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price. Our fiduciary duties as sole general partner of our operating partnership could create conflicts of interest.We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership, and, as such, will have fiduciary duties to our operating partnership and the limited partners in the operating partnership, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. The limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership provides that, in the event of a conflict between the duties owed by our directors to our company and the duties that we owe, in our capacity as the sole general partner of our operating partnership, to such limited partners, our directors are under no obligation to give priority to the interests of such limited partners. In addition, those persons holding OP units will have the right to vote on certain amendments to the limited partnership agreement (which require approval by a majority in interest of the limited partners, including us) and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights, as well as the right to vote on mergers and consolidations of us in our capacity as sole general partner of the operating partnership in certain limited circumstances. These voting rights may be exercised in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. For example, we cannot adversely affect the limited partners' rights to receive distributions, as set forth in the limited partnership agreement, without their consent, even though modifying such rights might be in the best interest of our stockholders generally.28We have never operated as a REIT and have only recently begun operating as a public company and, therefore, we cannot assure you that we will successfully and profitably operate our business in compliance with the regulatory requirements applicable to REITs and to public companies.We have not previously operated as a REIT and have only operated as a public company beginning the date of the closing of our IPO on September 6, 2011. In addition, certain members of our Board of Directors and certain of our executive officers have no experience in operating a publicly-traded REIT that is traded on a securities exchange. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully operate our company as a REIT or a publicly-traded company, including satisfying the requirements to timely meet disclosure requirements and complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including implementing effective internal controls. Failure to maintain our qualification as a REIT or comply with other regulatory requirements would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make dividends to our stockholders.Our Board of Directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval.Our investment, financing, borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to other activities, including growth, debt, capitalization and operations, will be determined by our Board of Directors. These policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of the Board of Directors without a vote of our stockholders. In addition, the Board of Directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements. A change in these policies could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders.We are highly dependent on information systems of ARC and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends.Our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems of ARC. Any failure or interruption of ARC's systems could cause delays or other problems in our securities trading activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.U.S. Federal Income Tax RisksOur failure to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax, and would adversely affect our operations and the market price of our common stock.We elected to be qualified to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2011. However, we may terminate our REIT qualification, if our Board of Directors determines that not qualifying as a REIT is in the best interests of our stockholders, or inadvertently. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, dividend, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. We currently intend to structure our activities in a manner designed to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a REIT. However, the REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT is limited. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, such recharacterization could jeopardize our ability to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a REIT. Furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative change to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.If we fail to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT qualification. Losing our REIT qualification would reduce our net earnings available for investment or dividends to stockholders because of the additional tax liability. In addition, dividends to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction, and we would no longer be required to make dividends. If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax.29Even if we qualify as a REIT, in certain circumstances, we may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for distribution to you.Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. For example, net income from the sale of properties that are “dealer” properties sold by a REIT (a “prohibited transaction” under the Code) will be subject to a 100% tax. We may not make sufficient dividends to avoid excise taxes applicable to REITs. We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay U.S. federal income tax directly on such income. In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly. However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file U.S. federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax. We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, including franchise, payroll and transfer taxes, either directly or at the level of our operating partnership or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets, such as TRSs, which are subject to full U.S. federal, state, local and foreign corporate-level income taxes. Any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to you.To qualify as a REIT we must meet annual dividend requirements, which may force us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions. This could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce your overall return.In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which dividends we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (a) 85% of our ordinary income, (b) 95% of our capital gain net income and (c) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. These requirements could cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on investments in real estate assets and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, possibly at unfavorable rates, or sell assets to fund these dividends. Although we intend to make dividends sufficient to meet the annual dividend requirements and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings while we qualify as a REIT, it is possible that we might not always be able to do so.Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to the prohibited transaction tax, which could reduce the return on your investment.For so long as we qualify as a REIT, our ability to dispose of property during the first few years following acquisition may be restricted to a substantial extent as a result of our REIT qualification. Under applicable provisions of the Code regarding prohibited transactions by REITs, while we qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of any property (other than foreclosure property) that we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding our TRSs, that is deemed to be inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of trade or business. Whether property is inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each property. While we qualify as a REIT, we intend to avoid the 100% prohibited transaction tax by (a) conducting activities that may otherwise be considered prohibited transactions through a TRS (but such TRS will incur income taxes), (b) conducting our operations in such a manner so that no sale or other disposition of an asset we own, directly or through any subsidiary, will be treated as a prohibited transaction or (c) structuring certain dispositions of our properties to comply with a prohibited transaction safe harbor available under the Code for properties held for at least two years. However, despite our present intention, no assurance can be given that any particular property we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding our TRSs, will not be treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Our two vacant properties will be held in a TRS because we are contemplating various strategies including selling them as a means of maximizing our value from those properties.Our TRSs are subject to corporate-level taxes and our dealings with our TRSs may be subject to 100% excise tax.A REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs. Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS. A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs.30A TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT, including gross income from operations pursuant to management contracts. We may use TRSs generally to hold properties for sale in the ordinary course of business or to hold assets or conduct activities that we cannot conduct directly as a REIT. Our TRSs will be subject to applicable U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax on its taxable income. In addition, the rules, which are applicable to us, also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's-length basis.If our operating partnership failed to qualify as a partnership or was not otherwise disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.We intend to maintain the status of our operating partnership as a partnership or a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, if the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of our operating partnership as a partnership or disregarded entity for such purposes, it would be taxable as a corporation. In such event, this would reduce the amount of dividends that our operating partnership could make to us. This also would also result in our failing to qualify as a REIT, and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our income. This substantially would reduce our cash available to pay dividends and the yield on your investment. In addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which our operating partnership owns its properties, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership and is otherwise not disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing dividends to the operating partnership. Such a recharacterization of an underlying property owner could also threaten our ability to maintain our REIT qualification.We may choose to make dividends in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you receive.In connection with our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. In order to satisfy this requirement, we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash and shares of our common stock at the election of each stockholder. Under IRS Revenue Procedure 2010-12, up to 90% of any such taxable dividend with respect to the taxable years ended on or before December 31, 2011 could be payable in our common stock. Taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. stockholders may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. Accordingly, U.S. stockholders receiving a dividend of our shares may be required to sell shares received in such dividend or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them, at a time that may be disadvantageous, in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such dividend. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock, by withholding or disposing of part of the shares in such dividend and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, such sale may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.Further, while Revenue Procedure 2010-12 applies only to taxable dividends payable by us in a combination of cash and stock with respect to the taxable years ended on or before December 31, 2011, and it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to pay taxable dividends in cash and stock in later years. Moreover, various tax aspects of such a taxable cash/stock dividend are uncertain and have not yet been addressed by the IRS. No assurance can be given that the IRS will not impose additional requirements in the future with respect to taxable cash/stock dividends, including on a retroactive basis, or assert that the requirements for such taxable cash/stock dividends have not been met.31The taxation of dividends to our stockholders can be complex; however, dividends that we make to our stockholders generally will be taxable as ordinary income.Dividends that we make to our taxable stockholders out of current and accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends, or, for tax years beginning before January 1, 2013, qualified dividend income) generally will be taxable as ordinary income. However, a portion of our dividends may (1) be designated by us as capital gain dividends generally taxable as long-term capital gain to the extent that they are attributable to net capital gain recognized by us, (2) be designated by us, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013, as qualified dividend income generally to the extent they are attributable to dividends we receive from our TRSs, or (3) constitute a return of capital generally to the extent that they exceed our accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder's investment in our common stock.Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.The maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates has been reduced to 15% for tax years beginning before January 1, 2013. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. Although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common stock.If we were considered to actually or constructively pay a “preferential dividend” to certain of our stockholders, our status as a REIT could be adversely affected.In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. In order for dividends to be counted as satisfying the annual dividend requirements for REITs, and to provide us with a REIT-level tax deduction, the dividends must not be “preferential dividends.” A dividend is not a preferential dividend if the dividend is pro rata among all outstanding shares of stock within a particular class, and in accordance with the preferences among different classes of stock as set forth in our organizational documents. Currently, there is uncertainty as to the IRS's position regarding whether certain arrangements that REITs have with their stockholders could give rise to the inadvertent payment of a preferential dividend (e.g., the pricing methodology for stock purchased under a dividend reinvestment plan inadvertently causing a greater than 5% discount on the price of such stock purchased). There is no de minimis exception with respect to preferential dividends; therefore, if the IRS were to take the position that we inadvertently paid a preferential dividend, we may be deemed to have failed the 90% dividend test, and our status as a REIT could be terminated for the year in which such determination is made if we were unable to cure such failure. While we believe that our operations have been structured in such a manner that we will not be treated as inadvertently paying preferential dividends, we can provide no assurance to this effect.Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets, if properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations, does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in a TRS generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such TRS.32Complying with REIT requirements may force us to forgo or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of mortgage-related securities. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% of the value of our total securities can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets from our portfolio or not make otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for dividend to our stockholders.The ability of our Board of Directors to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may subject us to U.S. federal income tax and reduce dividends to our stockholders.Our charter provides that our Board of Directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. While we elected to be qualified to be taxed as a REIT, we may not elect to be treated as a REIT or may terminate our REIT election if we determine that qualifying as a REIT is no longer in the best interests of our stockholders. If we cease to be a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our stockholders and on the market price of our common stock.We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability, reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the market price of our common stock.In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock. Additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets. You are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on your investment in our shares and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares. You also should note that our counsel's tax opinion is based upon existing law, applicable as of the date of its opinion, all of which will be subject to change, either prospectively or retroactively.Although REITs generally receive better tax treatment than entities taxed as regular corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation. As a result, our charter provides our Board of Directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the vote of our stockholders. Our Board of Directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders.33The share ownership restrictions of the Code for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our shares of stock and restrict our business combination opportunities.In order to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code, may not own, actually or constructively, more than 50% in value of our issued and outstanding shares of stock at any time during the last half of a taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made. Attribution rules in the Code determine if any individual or entity actually or constructively owns our shares of stock under this requirement. Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own our shares of stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year for each taxable year after December 31, 2011. To help insure that we meet these tests, among other purposes, our charter restricts the acquisition and ownership of our shares of stock. Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT while we so qualify. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, for so long as we qualify as a REIT, our charter prohibits, among other limitations on ownership and transfer of shares of our stock, any person from beneficially or constructively owning (applying certain attribution rules under the Code) more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of stock and not more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of our shares of stock. Our Board of Directors may not grant an exemption from these restrictions to any proposed transferee whose ownership in excess of the 9.8% ownership limit would result in the termination of our qualification as a REIT. Consistent with our charter, our Board of Directors has further limited such ownership of our stock (other than by our Sponsor) to no more than 5.25% in value of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of stock and not more than 5.25% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of our shares of stock. These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply, however, if our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with the restrictions is no longer required in order for us to qualify as a REIT.These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders.Non-U.S. stockholders will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on dividends received from us and upon the disposition of our shares.Subject to certain exceptions, dividends received from us will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Such dividends ordinarily will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the dividends are treated as “effectively connected” with the conduct by the non-U.S. stockholder of a U.S. trade or business. Pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, or FIRPTA, capital gain dividends attributable to sales or exchanges of “U.S. real property interests,” or USRPIs, generally will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. However, a capital gain dividend will not be treated as effectively connected income if (a) the dividend is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States; and (b) the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 5% of the class of our stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date the dividend is received. We anticipate that our shares will be “regularly traded” on an established securities market for the foreseeable future, although, no assurance can be given that this will be the case. Gain recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale or exchange of our common stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a USRPI under FIRPTA. Our common stock will not constitute a USRPI so long as we are a “domestically-controlled qualified investment entity.” A domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT if at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of such REIT's stock is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. stockholders. We believe, but cannot assure you, that we will be a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity, and because our common stock will be publicly traded, no assurance can be given that we will be a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity.Even if we do not qualify as a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity at the time a non-U.S. stockholder sells or exchanges our common stock, gain arising from such a sale or exchange would not be subject to U.S. taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI if: (a) our common stock is “regularly traded,” as defined by applicable Treasury regulations, on an established securities market, and (b) such non-U.S. stockholder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of our common stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders - Sale of Shares.” We encourage you to consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences applicable to you if you are a non-U.S. stockholder. 34Potential characterization of dividends or gain on sale may be treated as unrelated business taxable income to tax-exempt investors.If (a) we are a “pension-held REIT,” (b) a tax-exempt stockholder has incurred debt to purchase or hold our common stock, or (c) a holder of common stock is a certain type of tax-exempt stockholder, dividends on, and gains recognized on the sale of, common stock by such tax-exempt stockholder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax as unrelated business taxable income under the Code.
