Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to the Proposed Merger Failure to complete the proposed merger could negatively affect us. On March 15, 2007, we entered into the Merger Agreement with GE and its wholly owned subsidiary, Jade Merger Sub, Inc. In conjunction with the Merger, GE entered into an agreement (the Mortgage Sale Agreement) to sell our mortgage operations (the Mortgage Sale) to Blackstone. The Merger is subject to approval by our stockholders and state licensing and other regulatory approvals, as well as various other closing conditions. There is no assurance when or if the Merger Agreement and the Merger will be approved by our stockholders, and there is no assurance when or whether the other conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied. In connection with the Merger, we may be impacted by the following risks: § the current market price of our Common stock may reflect a market assumption that the Merger will occur, and a failure to complete the Merger could result in a decline in the market price of our Common stock; § the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to a termination of the Merger Agreement; § the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against us, members of our Board of Directors and others relating to the Merger including any settlement of such legal proceedings that may be subject to court approval; § the inability to complete the Merger due to the failure to obtain stockholder approval or the failure to satisfy other conditions to the consummation of the Merger; § the failure of the Merger to close for any other reason; § the failure to obtain the necessary financing arrangements set forth in commitment letters received by Blackstone in connection with the Mortgage Sale; § our remedies against GE and its affiliates with respect to certain breaches of the Merger Agreement may not be adequate to cover our damages; § the proposed transactions disrupt current business plans and operations and the potential difficulties in attracting and retaining employees as a result of the Merger; § the effect of the announcement of the Merger and the Mortgage Sale on our business relationships, operating results and business generally and § the costs, fees, expenses and charges we have and may incur related to the Merger and the Mortgage Sale. Pending litigation relating to the Merger and the Merger Agreement and our potential indemnification obligations and limitations of our directors and officers liability insurance in connection with such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flow. We, our Directors, and certain other parties are defendants in two purported class actions pursuant to which the plaintiffs allege a breach of fiduciary duties by our Board of Directors in approving the Merger and the Merger Agreement. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, for a more detailed description of these proceedings. We intend to respond appropriately in defending against the alleged claims in each of these matters. These actions, however, remain in preliminary stages, and it is not yet possible to determine their ultimate outcome at this time. We, therefore, cannot provide assurance that the legal and other costs associated with the defense of these actions, the time required to be spent by management and the Board of Directors on these matters and the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we have an obligation to indemnify and pay expenses in advance for our Directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law in relation to these matters under Maryland law, our charter and our by- 31 Table of Contents laws. Such indemnification may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows to the extent insurance does not cover our costs. The insurance carriers that provide our directors and officers liability policies may seek to rescind or deny coverage with respect to these matters or we may not have sufficient coverage under such policies. If the insurance carriers are successful in rescinding or denying coverage to us and/or some of our Directors or officers, or if we do not have sufficient coverage under our policies, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected. Risks Related to our Internal Control Deficiencies, the Restatement of our Financial Statements and the Delay in Filing our Periodic Reports We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. During the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006, we identified a number of control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. A number of these control deficiencies were classified as material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that in the aggregate constituted material weaknesses. A material weakness is a control deficiency that results in there being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their assigned functions. The material weaknesses identified for the year ended December 31, 2006 have not been fully remediated as of the filing of this Form 10-K. In addition, management determined that certain material weaknesses identified for the year ended December 31, 2005 had not been fully remediated as of December 31, 2006. Based on the material weaknesses identified, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2006. In addition, management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective for our quarterly and annual reporting periods in 2007. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures for additional information. As of the end of the period covered in this Form 10-K, management performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding disclosures. Based on the evaluation and the identification of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described above, as well as our inability to file this Form 10-K within the statutory time period, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2006, and management further expects that our disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective for our quarterly and annual reporting periods in 2007. There can be no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent future error or fraud in connection with our financial statements. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to our internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements. During 2006, we devoted substantial internal and external resources to the completion of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 (our 2005 Form 10-K) and related matters. As a result of these efforts, along with efforts to complete our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we incurred incremental fees and expenses for additional auditor services, financial and other consulting services, legal services and liquidity waivers of approximately $44 million through December 31, 2006. While we do not expect fees and expenses relating to the preparation of our financial results for future periods to remain at this level, in 2007, we expect them to remain significantly higher than historical fees and expenses. These expenses, as well as the substantial time devoted by our management towards addressing the material weaknesses identified, could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We have delayed the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. As a result, we do not have current financial information available and are not able to register our securities for offer and sale until we are deemed a current filer with the SEC. We have delayed the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. Investors must evaluate whether to purchase or sell our securities in light of the lack of current financial information 32 Table of Contents concerning us. Accordingly, any investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. In addition, until current periodic reports and financial statements are available for us, we will be precluded from registering our securities with the SEC for offer and sale. This precludes us from raising debt or equity financing in the public markets and restrains our ability to use stock options and other equity-based awards to attract, retain and provide incentives to our employees. Finally, Blackstone may be unable to raise the financing needed to complete the Mortgage Sale (which is a condition to closing the Merger) until our current financial information is available. As a result of the delays in filing our periodic reports, we have obtained certain waivers regarding the delivery of financial statements under our financing agreements and certain other contractual and regulatory requirements. We may require additional waivers in the future, particularly if we are unable to meet the deadlines for the delivery of our 2007 quarterly financial statements. Failure to deliver these financial statements within the deadlines or to obtain additional waivers could be material and adverse to our business, liquidity and financial condition. We have previously obtained certain waivers and may need to seek additional waivers extending the deadlines for the delivery of our financial statements, the financial statements of our subsidiaries and related documents to certain lenders, trustees and other third parties in connection with certain of our financing, servicing, hedging and related agreements and instruments (collectively, our Financing Agreements). We obtained waivers under certain of our Financing Agreements which waive certain potential breaches of covenants under those instruments and establish the extended deadlines for the delivery of our financial statements and related documents to the various lenders under those instruments. Due to the delays in completing our financial statements for 2005 and 2006, we have not yet filed our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. We obtained waivers for certain of our Financing Agreements extending the deadline for the delivery of our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 until June 29, 2007. We intend to deliver our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 on or before June 29, 2007. We may require additional waivers in the future if we are unable to meet this deadline for the delivery of our financial statements. Under certain of our Financing Agreements, the lenders or trustees have the right to notify us if they believe we have breached a covenant under the operative documents and may declare an event of default. If one or more notices of default were to be given with respect to the delivery of our financial statements, we believe we would have various periods in which to cure such events of default. If we do not cure the events of default or obtain necessary waivers within the required time periods or certain extended time periods, the maturity of some of our debt could be accelerated and our ability to incur additional indebtedness could be restricted. In addition, events of default or acceleration under certain of our Financing Agreements would trigger cross-default provisions under certain of our other Financing Agreements. We have not yet delivered our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 to the MTN Indenture Trustee, which are required to be delivered no later than May 25, 2007 under the MTN Indenture. As a result of our failure to deliver these financial statements, the MTN Indenture Trustee could provide us with a notice of default. In the event that we receive such notice, we would have 90 days from receipt to cure this default or to seek additional waivers of the financial statement delivery requirements under the MTN Indenture. We also obtained certain waivers and may need to seek additional waivers extending the date for the delivery of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and other documents related to such financial statements to certain regulators, investors in mortgage loans and other third parties in order to satisfy state mortgage licensing regulations and certain contractual requirements. We will continue to seek similar waivers as may be necessary in the future. There can be no assurance that any additional waivers will be received on a timely basis, if at all, or that any waivers obtained, including the waivers we have already obtained, will be obtained on reasonable terms or will extend for a sufficient period of time to avoid an acceleration event, an event of default or other restrictions on our business operations. The failure to obtain such waivers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, liquidity and financial condition. 33 Table of Contents The delays in filing our periodic reports with the SEC could cause the NYSE to commence suspension or delisting procedures with respect to our Common stock. As a result of the delay in filing our periodic reports with the SEC, we are in breach of the continued listing requirements of the NYSE. Further delays in the filing of our periodic reports could cause the NYSE to commence suspension or delisting procedures in respect of our Common stock. The commencement of any suspension or delisting procedures by the NYSE remains, at all times, at the discretion of the NYSE and would be publicly announced by the NYSE. The delisting of our Common stock from the NYSE prior to the Merger may have a material adverse effect on us by, among other things, limiting: § the liquidity of our Common stock; § the market price of our Common stock; § the number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in our Common stock; § the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our Common stock; § the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our Common stock and § our ability to obtain equity financing for the continuation of our operations. Pending securities litigation and potential indemnification obligations and limitations of our directors and officers liability insurance in connection with such securities litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We, our Directors, Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer are defendants in several securities lawsuits. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, for a more detailed description of these proceedings. We intend to respond appropriately in defending against the alleged claims in each of these matters. These actions, however, remain in preliminary stages, and it is not yet possible to determine their ultimate outcome at this time. We, therefore, cannot provide assurance that the legal and other costs associated with the defense of these actions, the time required to be spent by management and the Board of Directors on these matters and the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we have an obligation to indemnify and pay expenses in advance for our Directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law in relation to these matters under Maryland law, our charter and our by-laws. Such indemnification may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows to the extent insurance does not cover our costs. The insurance carriers that provide our directors and officers liability policies may seek to rescind or deny coverage with respect to these matters or we may not have sufficient coverage under such policies. If the insurance carriers are successful in rescinding or denying coverage to us and/or some of our Directors or officers, or if we do not have sufficient coverage under our policies, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected. Continuing negative publicity may adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As a result of the delay in the filing of our financial statements, our internal control deficiencies and the restatement of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 in the 2005 Form 10-K, we have been the subject of continuing negative publicity. This negative publicity may inhibit our ability to attract new clients and business partners and have an effect on the terms under which some clients are willing to continue to do business with us. Continuing negative publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 34 Table of Contents Risks Related to our Business The termination of our status as the exclusive recommended provider of mortgage products and services promoted by the residential and commercial real estate brokerage business owned and operated by Realogys affiliate, NRT, the title and settlement services business owned and operated by Realogys affiliate, TRG and the relocation business owned and operated by Realogys affiliate, Cartus, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Under the terms of the Strategic Relationship Agreement, we are the exclusive recommended provider of mortgage loans to the independent sales associates affiliated with the residential and commercial real estate brokerage business owned and operated by Realogys affiliate, NRT, certain customers of Realogy and all U.S.-based employees of Cendant. The Marketing Agreement similarly provides that we are the exclusive recommended provider of mortgage loans and related products to the independent sales associates of Realogys real estate brokerage franchisees, which include Coldwell Banker Real Estate Corporation, Century 21 Real Estate LLC, ERA Franchise Systems, Inc. and Sothebys International Affiliates, Inc. See Item 1. BusinessArrangements with RealogyMortgage Venture Between Realogy and PHH, Strategic Relationship Agreement and Marketing Agreements in this Form 10-K for more information. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 50% of loans originated by our Mortgage Production segment were derived from NRT and Cartus. We anticipate that a similar portion of mortgage loan originations from our Mortgage Production segment during 2007 will be comprised of business arising out of our arrangements with Realogy. In 2006, Cendant spun-off its real estate services division, Realogy, into an independent, publicly traded company. On April 10, 2007, Realogy became a wholly owned subsidiary of Domus Holdings Corp., an affiliate of Apollo Management VI, L.P., following the completion of a merger and related transactions. As a result of the Realogy Spin-Off and the proposed Merger, on March 14, 2007, we, along with certain of our affiliates entered into the Consent which, among other things, provided for Realogys consent under the Realogy Agreements to the Merger, the Mortgage Sale and transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Mortgage Sale Agreement. Pursuant to the Consent, we obtained certain corrective amendments to certain provisions of the Realogy Agreements, but these amendments will not be effective unless and until the Mortgage Sale is completed immediately following the Merger. The provisions of the Consent will terminate and be void in the event that either the Merger Agreement or the Mortgage Sale Agreement is terminated. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain any additional required amendments we believe may be necessary or appropriate or that if obtained, that these amendments will be on terms favorable to us. Pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage Venture Operating Agreement, beginning on February 1, 2015, Realogy will have the right at any time upon two years notice to us to terminate its interest in the Mortgage Venture. A termination of the Mortgage Venture could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the Strategic Relationship Agreement provides that Realogy has the right to terminate the covenant requiring it to exclusively recommend us as the provider of mortgage loans to the independent sales associates affiliated with the residential and commercial real estate brokerage business owned and operated by Realogys affiliate, NRT, certain customers of Realogy, and all U.S.-based employees of Cendant, following notice and a cure period, if: § we materially breach any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the Strategic Relationship Agreement, the Marketing Agreement, the Trademark License Agreements or certain other related agreements; § we or the Mortgage Venture become subject to any regulatory order or governmental proceeding and such order or proceeding prevents or materially impairs the Mortgage Ventures ability to originate mortgage loans for any period of time (which order or proceeding is not generally applicable to companies in the mortgage lending business) in a manner that adversely affects the value of one or more of the quarterly distributions to be paid by the Mortgage Venture pursuant to the Mortgage Venture Operating Agreement; § the Mortgage Venture otherwise is not permitted by law, regulation, rule, order or other legal restriction to perform its origination function in any jurisdiction, but in such case exclusivity may be terminated only with respect to such jurisdiction or 35 Table of Contents § the Mortgage Venture does not comply with its obligations to complete an acquisition of a mortgage loan origination company under the terms of the Strategic Relationship Agreement. If Realogy were to terminate its exclusivity obligations with respect to the Mortgage Venture, it would adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Adverse developments in general business, economic, environmental and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our businesses and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, including the secondary market for mortgage loans, and the general condition of the U.S. economy and housing market, both nationally and in the regions in which we conduct our businesses. A significant portion of our mortgage loan originations are made in a small number of geographical areas which include: California, New Jersey, Florida, New York and Texas. A host of factors beyond our control could cause fluctuations in these conditions, including political events, such as civil unrest, war or acts or threats of war or terrorism and environmental events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters. Adverse developments in these conditions and resulting general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our business is significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities. We are particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. The Federal Reserve Boards policies affect the size of the mortgage origination market, the pricing of our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in any of these policies are beyond our control, difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Recent developments in the subprime mortgage market may negatively affect the mortgage loan origination volumes and profitability of mortgage loan products that we offer in our Mortgage Production segment. Rising default rates by subprime borrowers have caused investors in subprime mortgage loans in the secondary market to demand better terms. A number of mortgage loan originators have consequently revised their underwriting guidelines for subprime mortgage loans, which have made subprime mortgage loans either more costly for potential subprime borrowers to obtain or resulted in certain potential subprime borrowers no longer qualifying for mortgage loans at all. As a result of these changes in the subprime secondary mortgage market, mortgage loan originators, including clients in our financial institutions channel, could revise their underwriting guidelines for mortgage loan products that we offer, in anticipation of or in response to further demands for improved mortgage loan terms by investors in the secondary mortgage market. As a result, the cost of mortgage loans for potential borrowers may increase significantly, certain mortgage loan products may no longer be available or certain potential borrowers may no longer qualify for mortgage loans at all. Although subprime products are a de minimis component of our business, such changes in the mortgage loan market could cause our origination volumes for mortgage loan products to decline materially, which could also cause our profit margins to decline due to increased competition among mortgage loan originators and higher unit costs, thus reducing revenues from our Mortgage Production segment. Downward trends in the real estate market could adversely impact our business, profitability or results of operations. A decline in the real estate market, which may be accompanied by relatively higher interest rates, would mean less opportunity for purchase mortgage loan originations. As a result of these downward trends, revenues in our Mortgage Production segment could materially decline. Moreover, these trends could cause our origination volumes for mortgage loan products to decline materially, which could also cause our profit margins to decline due to increased competition among mortgage loan originators and higher unit costs, thus reducing revenues in our Mortgage Production segment. These conditions also increase the risk that borrowers, particularly borrowers who 36 Table of Contents have adjustable-rate mortgage loans, will not be able to repay those loans and increase the risk that the value of the properties securing those mortgage loans will be insufficient to satisfy the amounts owed to us or our clients in the event a borrower defaults on a mortgage loan. These downward trends in the real estate market could impact demand for mortgage loans by investors in the secondary mortgage market, increase the demand for or cost of credit enhancements that we might be required to give such investors in connection with sales of mortgage loans or alter the risks associated with some or all of the mortgage loans that we sell into the secondary mortgage market. As a result, our access to the secondary mortgage market may be reduced, restricted or less profitable in the current industry environment. Our business is affected by fluctuations in interest rates, and if we fail to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates effectively, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. Our principal market exposure is to interest rate risk, specifically long-term U.S. Treasury (Treasury) and mortgage interest rates due to their impact on mortgage-related assets and commitments. We also have exposure to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable-rate borrowings, other interest rate-sensitive liabilities and net investment in variable-rate lease assets. The level and volatility of interest rates significantly affect the mortgage lending industry. A decline in mortgage interest rates generally increases the demand for home loans as more potential homeowners seek mortgage loans and more borrowers seek to refinance existing loans, but also generally leads to accelerated payoffs in our mortgage servicing portfolio, which negatively impacts the value of our MSRs. Historically, as interest rates increase, mortgage loan production decreases, particularly production from loan refinancing. An environment of gradual interest rate increases may, however, signify an improving economy or increasing real estate values, which in turn may stimulate increased home buying activity. Generally, in periods of reduced mortgage loan production, the associated profit margins also decline due to increased competition among mortgage loan originators and higher unit costs, thus further reducing our mortgage production revenues. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, mortgage loan servicing revenues generally increase because mortgage prepayment rates tend to decrease, extending the average life of our servicing portfolio and increasing the value of our MSRs. We attempt to manage our interest rate risk, in part, through the use of derivatives, including swap contracts, forward delivery commitments, futures and options contracts to manage and reduce this risk. Our main objective in managing interest rate risk is to moderate the impact of changes in interest rates on our earnings over time. Our interest rate risk management strategies may result in significant earnings volatility in the short term. The success of our interest rate risk management strategy is largely dependent on our ability to predict the earnings sensitivity of our loan servicing and loan production activities in various interest rate environments, which is inherently uncertain. Significant changes in current market conditions and/or the assumptions used (including the relationship of the change in the value of the MSRs to the change in the value of derivatives) in developing our estimates of borrower behavior and future interest rates could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Certain hedging strategies that we use to manage interest rate risk associated with our MSRs and other mortgage-related assets and commitments may not be effective in mitigating those risks. We employ various economic hedging strategies to attempt to mitigate the interest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of our assets, including our mortgage loans held for sale (MLHS), interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and our MSRs. We use various derivative and other financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. Our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps, caps and floors, options to purchase these items, futures and forward contracts and/or purchasing or selling Treasury securities. Our hedging decisions in the future will be determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time and may differ from our current hedging strategy. We also seek to manage interest rate risk in our Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing segments partially by monitoring and seeking to maintain an appropriate balance between our loan production volume and the size of our mortgage servicing portfolio, as the value of MSRs and the income they provide tend to be counter-cyclical to the changes in production volumes and gain on sale of loans that result from changes in interest rates. Our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating the risks related to changes in interest rates. Poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions could actually increase our risk and losses. There have been 37 Table of Contents periods, and it is likely that there will be periods in the future, during which we incur losses after accounting for our hedging strategies. As stated earlier, the success of our interest rate risk management strategy is largely dependent on our ability to predict the earnings sensitivity of our loan servicing and loan production activities in various interest rate environments. Our hedging strategies also rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds, we may incur losses that could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our business relies, in part, on warehouse, repurchase and other credit facilities to fund mortgage loans and vehicle purchases. If any of our warehouse, repurchase and other credit facilities are terminated as a result of our breach of the agreement or are not renewed, we may be unable to find replacement financing on commercially favorable terms, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our business relies, in part, on warehouse, repurchase and other credit facilities to fund mortgage loans and vehicle purchases, a significant portion of which is short-term. If any of our warehouse, repurchase or other credit facilities are terminated as a result of our breach of the agreement or are not renewed, we may be unable to find replacement financing on commercially favorable terms, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and, if we fail to meet the competitive challenges in our industries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We operate in highly competitive industries that could become even more competitive as a result of economic, legislative, regulatory and technological changes. Certain of our competitors are larger than we are and have access to greater financial resources than we do. Competition for mortgage loans comes primarily from large commercial banks and savings institutions, which typically have lower funding costs and are less reliant than we are on the sale of mortgages into the secondary markets to maintain their liquidity. In addition, technological advances and heightened e-commerce activity have generally increased consumers access to products and services. This has intensified competition among banking, as well as non-banking companies, in offering financial products and services, with or without the need for a physical presence. If competition in the mortgage services industry continues to increase, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We expect that the mortgage industry will become increasingly competitive in 2007 as lower origination volumes put pressure on production margins and ultimately result in further industry consolidation. We intend to take advantage of this environment by leveraging our existing mortgage origination services platform to enter into new outsourcing relationships as more companies determine that it is no longer economically feasible to compete in the industry, however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this effort whether as a result of the delays in the availability of our financial statements, uncertainties regarding the proposed Merger or otherwise. The fleet management industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete against large national competitors, such as GE Commercial Finance Fleet Services, Wheels, Inc., Automotive Resources International, Lease Plan International and other local and regional competitors, including numerous competitors who focus on one or two products. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by decreasing our market share or depressing the prices that we can charge. Changes in existing U.S. government-sponsored mortgage programs, or disruptions in the secondary markets for mortgage loans could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our ability to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales to institutional investors depends to a significant degree on programs administered by government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and others that facilitate the issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market. These government-sponsored enterprises play a powerful role in the residential mortgage industry, and we have significant business relationships with them. Proposals are being considered in Congress and by various regulatory authorities 38 Table of Contents that would affect the manner in which these government-sponsored enterprises conduct their business, including proposals to establish a new independent agency to regulate the government-sponsored enterprises, to require them to register their stock with the SEC, to reduce or limit certain business benefits that they receive from the U.S. government and to limit the size of the mortgage loan portfolios that they may hold. Any discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of these government-sponsored enterprises could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Also, any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary market or the underwriting criteria of these government-sponsored enterprises could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The businesses in which we engage are complex and heavily regulated, and changes in the regulatory environment affecting our businesses could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations that affect our business, including mortgage- and real estate-related regulations such as RESPA, which restricts the payment of fees or other consideration for the referral of real estate settlement services, including mortgage loans, as well as rules and regulations related to taxation, vicarious liability, insurance and accounting. Our Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing segments, in general, are heavily regulated by mortgage lending laws at the federal, state and local levels, and proposals for further regulation of the financial services industry, including recently proposed and enacted regulations addressing borrowers with blemished credit and non-traditional mortgage products, are continually being introduced. The establishment of the Mortgage Venture and the continuing relationships between and among the Mortgage Venture, Realogy and us are subject to the anti-kickback requirements of RESPA. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires us to disclose certain information about the mortgage loans we originate and purchase, such as the race and gender of our customers, the disposition of mortgage applications, income levels and interest rate (i.e. annual percentage rate) information. We believe that publication of such information may lead to heightened scrutiny of all mortgage lenders loan pricing and underwriting practices. We are also subject to privacy regulations. We manage highly sensitive non-public personal information in all of our operating segments, which is regulated by law. Problems with the safeguarding and proper use of this information could result in regulatory actions and negative publicity, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. With respect to our Fleet Management Services segment, we could be subject to unlimited liability as the owner of leased vehicles in two major provinces in Canada and are subject to limited liability in the Province of Ontario and as many as fifteen jurisdictions in the U.S. under the legal theory of vicarious liability. Congress, state legislatures, federal and state regulatory agencies and other professional and regulatory entities review existing laws, rules, regulations and policies and periodically propose changes that could significantly affect or restrict the manner in which we conduct our business. It is possible that one or more legislative proposals may be adopted or one or more regulatory changes, changes in interpretations of laws and regulations, judicial decisions or governmental enforcement actions may be implemented that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For example, certain trends in the regulatory environment could result in increased pressure from our clients for us to assume more residual risk on the value of the vehicles at the end of the lease term. If this were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our failure to comply with such laws, rules or regulations, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our Fleet Management Services business contracts with various government agencies, which may be subject to audit and potential reduction of costs and fees. Contracts with federal, state and local government agencies may be subject to audits, which could result in the disallowance of certain fees and costs. These audits may be conducted by government agencies and can result in the disallowance of significant costs and expenses if the auditing agency determines, in its discretion, that certain costs 39 Table of Contents and expenses were not warranted or were excessive. Disallowance of costs and expenses, if pervasive or significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business. If certain change in control transactions occur, some of our mortgage loan origination arrangements with financial institutions could be subject to termination at the election of such institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 49% of our mortgage loan originations were derived from our financial institutions channel, pursuant to which we provide outsourced mortgage loan services for customers of our financial institution clients such as Merrill Lynch, TD Banknorth, N.A. and Charles Schwab Bank. Our agreements with some of these financial institutions provide the applicable financial institution with the right to terminate its relationship with us prior to the expiration of the contract term if we complete a change in control transaction with certain third-party acquirers. Although in some cases these contracts would require the payment of liquidated damages in such an event, such amounts may not fully compensate us for all of our actual or expected loss of business opportunity for the remaining duration of the contract term. Accordingly, if we are unable to obtain consents to or waivers of certain rights of certain of our clients in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have entered into the Waiver with Merrill Lynch which provides for a waiver of its rights in connection with a change in control from the Merger, Mortgage Sale and transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Mortgage Sale Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain similar waivers and amendments from our other financial institution clients. Unanticipated liabilities of our Fleet Management Services segment as a result of damages in connection with motor vehicle accidents under the theory of vicarious liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our Fleet Management Services segment could be liable for damages in connection with motor vehicle accidents under the theory of vicarious liability in certain jurisdictions in which we do business. Under this theory, companies that lease motor vehicles may be subject to liability for the tortious acts of their lessees, even in situations where the leasing company has not been negligent. Our Fleet Management Services segment is subject to unlimited liability as the owner of leased vehicles in two major provinces in Canada and is subject to limited liability (e.g., in the event of a lessees failure to meet certain insurance or financial responsibility requirements) in the Province of Ontario and as many as fifteen jurisdictions in the U.S. Although our lease contracts require that each lessee indemnifies us against such liabilities, in the event that a lessee lacks adequate insurance coverage or financial resources to satisfy these indemnity provisions, we could be liable for property damage or injuries caused by the vehicles that we lease. On August 10, 2005, a federal law was enacted in the U.S. which preempted state vicarious liability laws that imposed unlimited liability on a vehicle lessor. This law, however, does not preempt existing state laws that impose limited liability on a vehicle lessor in the event that certain insurance or financial responsibility requirements for the leased vehicles are not met. Prior to the enactment of this law, our Fleet Management Services segment was subject to unlimited liability in the District of Columbia, Maine and New York. It is unclear at this time whether any of these three jurisdictions will enact legislation imposing limited or an alternative form of liability on vehicle lessors. In addition, the scope, application and enforceability of this federal law have not been fully tested. For example, a state trial court in New York has ruled that the law is unconstitutional. The ultimate disposition of this New York case and its impact on the federal law are uncertain at this time. Additionally, a law was enacted in the Province of Ontario setting a cap of $1 million on a lessors liability for personal injuries for accidents occurring on or after March 1, 2006. The scope, application and enforceability of this provincial law also have not been fully tested. A failure to maintain our investment grade ratings could impact our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms and could negatively impact our business. In the event our credit ratings were to drop below investment grade, our access to the public debt markets may be severely limited. The cut-off for investment grade is generally considered to be a long-term rating of Baa3, BBB- and BBB- for Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, respectively. In the event of a ratings downgrade below investment grade, we may be required to rely upon alternative sources of financing, such as bank 40 Table of Contents lines and private debt placements (secured and unsecured). Declines in our credit ratings would also increase our cost of borrowing under our credit facilities. Furthermore, we may be unable to retain all of our existing bank credit commitments beyond the then-existing maturity dates. As a consequence, our cost of financing could rise significantly, thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance some of our capital-intensive activities, such as our ongoing investment in MSRs and other retained interests. Among other things, maintenance of our investment grade ratings requires that we demonstrate high levels of liquidity, including access to alternative sources of funding such as committed bank stand-by lines of credit, as well as a capital structure and leverage appropriate for companies in our industry. On January 22, 2007, Standard & Poors downgraded its rating on our senior unsecured long-term debt to BBB−. As a result, the fees and interest rates on borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility, Supplemental Credit Facility and Tender Support Facility (as defined in Item 7. Managements Discussion and AnalysisLiquidity and Capital ResourcesIndebtednessUnsecured DebtCredit Facilities) increased pursuant to the terms of each agreement. As of May 22, 2007, our senior unsecured long-term debt credit ratings from Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings were Baa3, BBB− and BBB+, respectively, and our short-term debt credit ratings were P-3, A-3 and F-2, respectively. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, and they may require management to make assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. Because of the inherent uncertainty of the estimates and assumptions associated with these critical accounting policies, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to the related amounts recorded in this Form 10-K. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies for more information on our critical accounting policies. Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position. Our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP), which are periodically revised and/or expanded. The application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position. In addition, new or revised accounting standards may impact certain of our leasing or lending products, which could adversely affect our profitability. We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by or on behalf of our customers and counterparties. In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Our financial position and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading. 41 Table of Contents An interruption in or breach of our information systems may result in lost business, regulatory actions or litigation or may otherwise have an adverse effect on our reputation, revenues, profitability and business prospects. We rely heavily upon communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of our information systems or the third-party information systems on which we rely could cause underwriting or other delays and could result in fewer loan applications being received, slower processing of applications and reduced efficiency in loan servicing in our Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing segments, as well as business interruptions in our Fleet Management Services segment. We are required to comply with significant federal, state and foreign laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate, with respect to the handling of consumer information, and a breach in the security of our information systems could result in regulatory actions and litigation against us. If a failure, interruption or breach occurs, it may not be adequately addressed by us or the third parties on which we rely. Such a failure, interruption or breach could have an adverse effect on our reputation, revenues, profitability and business prospects. The success and growth of our business may be adversely affected if we do not adapt to and implement technological changes. Our business is dependent upon technological advancement, such as the ability to process loan applications over the internet, accept electronic payments and provide immediate status updates to our clients and customers. To the extent that we become reliant on any particular technology or technological solution, we may be harmed if the technology or technological solution: § becomes non-compliant with existing industry standards or is no longer supported by vendors; § fails to meet or exceed the capabilities of our competitors corresponding technologies or technological solutions; § becomes increasingly expensive to service, retain and update; or § becomes subject to third-party claims of copyright or patent infringement. Our failure to acquire necessary technologies or technological solutions could limit our ability to remain competitive and could also limit our ability to increase our cost efficiencies, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Risks Related to the Spin-Off Our agreements with Cendant and Realogy may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arms-length negotiations between unaffiliated parties. The agreements related to our separation from Cendant and the continuation of certain business arrangements with Cendant and Realogy, including the Separation Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Strategic Relationship Agreement, the Marketing Agreement and other agreements, were not the result of arms-length negotiations and thus may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arms-length negotiations between two unaffiliated parties. This could include, among other things, the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnities and other obligations between Cendant, Realogy and us. See Item 1. BusinessArrangements with Cendant and Arrangements with Realogy for more information. We may be required to satisfy certain indemnification obligations to Cendant or Realogy, or we may not be able to collect on indemnification rights from Cendant or Realogy. In connection with the Spin-Off, we and Cendant and our respective affiliates have agreed to indemnify each other for certain liabilities and obligations. Our indemnification obligations could be significant. We are required to indemnify Cendant for any taxes incurred by it and its affiliates as a result of any action, misrepresentation or omission by us or one of our subsidiaries that causes the distribution of our Common stock by Cendant or transactions relating to the internal reorganization to fail to qualify as tax-free. We are also responsible for 13.7% of any taxes resulting from the failure of the Spin-Off or transactions relating to the internal reorganization to qualify as tax-free, which failure is not due to the actions, misrepresentations or omissions of Cendant or us or our 42 Table of Contents respective subsidiaries. Such percentage was based on the relative pro forma net book values of Cendant and us as of September 30, 2004, without giving effect to any adjustments to the book values of certain long-lived assets that may be required as a result of the Spin-Off and the related transactions. We cannot determine whether we will have to indemnify Cendant or its current or former affiliates for any substantial obligations in the future. There also can be no assurance that if Cendant or Realogy is required to indemnify us for any substantial obligations, they will be able to satisfy those obligations. Certain arrangements and agreements that we have entered into with Cendant in connection with the Spin-Off could impact our tax and other assets and liabilities in the future, and our financial statements are subject to future adjustments as a result of our obligations under those arrangements and agreements. In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into certain arrangements and agreements with Cendant that could impact our tax and other assets and liabilities in the future. See Item 1. BusinessArrangements with Cendant for more information. For example, we are party to the Amended Tax Sharing Agreement with Cendant that contains provisions governing the allocation of liabilities for taxes between Cendant and us, indemnification for certain tax liabilities and responsibility for preparing and filing tax returns and defending contested tax positions, as well as other tax-related matters including the sharing of tax information and cooperating with the preparation and filing of tax returns. Pursuant to the Amended Tax Sharing Agreement, our tax assets and liabilities may be affected by Cendants future tax returns and may also be impacted by the results of audits of Cendants prior tax years, including the settlement of any such audits. See Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Consequently, our financial statements are subject to future adjustments which may not be fully resolved until the audits of Cendants prior years returns are completed. Our historical financial information may not be representative of results we would have achieved as an independent company or will achieve in the future. Because our business has changed substantially due to the internal reorganization in connection with the Spin-Off and we now conduct our business as an independent, publicly traded company, our historical financial information does not reflect what our results of operations, financial position or cash flows would have been had we been an independent, publicly traded company during all of the periods presented. For this reason, as well as the inherent uncertainties of our business, the historical financial information for such periods is not indicative of what our results of operations, financial position or cash flows will be in the future. See Note 24, Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Risks Related to our Common Stock There may be a limited public market for our Common stock and our stock price may experience volatility. Prior to the Spin-Off, there was no public market for our Common stock. In connection with the Spin-Off, our Common stock was listed on the NYSE under the symbol PHH. From February 1, 2005 through May 15, 2007, the closing trading price for our Common stock has ranged from $20.34 to $31.10. However, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our Common stock will be sustained in the future. In addition, the stock market has from time-to-time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Changes in earnings estimates by analysts and economic and other external factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our Common stock. Fluctuations or decreases in the trading price of our Common stock may adversely affect the liquidity of the trading market for our Common stock and our ability to raise capital through future equity financing. In addition, on March 15, 2007, we announced the Merger which would entitle stockholders to receive $31.50 per share of our Common stock. There is no assurance that the Merger will be approved by our stockholders, and there is no assurance when or whether the other conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied. Provisions in our charter documents, the Maryland General Corporation Law (the MGCL) and our stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party. Our charter and by-laws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions include, among other things, a classified Board of Directors, advance notice for raising business or making nominations at meetings and blank 43 Table of Contents check preferred stock. Blank check preferred stock enables our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock with such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, including the right to issue convertible securities with no limitations on conversion, as our Board of Directors may determine, including rights to dividends and proceeds in a liquidation that are senior to the Common stock. We are also subject to certain provisions of the MGCL which could delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their Common stock or may otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. These include, among other provisions: § The business combinations statute which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and § The control share acquisition statute which provides that control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. On March 11, 2007, our Board of Directors took action to exempt from the business combination statute to the fullest extent permitted by the MGCL any business combination contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Mortgage Sale Agreement and any transactions contemplated by each agreement, including the Merger and Mortgage Sale. Our by-laws contain a provision exempting any share of our capital stock from the control share acquisition statute to the fullest extent permitted by the MGCL. However, our Board of Directors has the exclusive right to amend our by-laws and, subject to their fiduciary duties, could at any time in the future amend the by-laws to remove this exemption provision. In addition, we entered into the Rights Agreement, dated as of January 28, 2005, with The Bank of New York, as rights agent. This agreement entitles our stockholders to acquire shares of our Common stock at a price equal to 50% of the then-current market value in limited circumstances when a third party acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding Common stock or commences a tender offer for at least 15% of our Common stock, in each case, in a transaction that our Board of Directors does not approve. Because, under these limited circumstances, all of our stockholders would become entitled to effect discounted purchases of our Common stock, other than the person or group that caused the rights to become exercisable, the existence of these rights would significantly increase the cost of acquiring control of our company without the support of our Board of Directors. The existence of the rights agreement could therefore deter potential acquirers and reduce the likelihood that stockholders receive a premium for our Common stock in an acquisition. On March 14, 2007, prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into an amendment to the Rights Agreement. The amendment revises certain terms of the Rights Agreement to render it inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Certain provisions of the Mortgage Venture Operating Agreement that we have with Realogy could discourage third parties from seeking to acquire us or could reduce the amount of consideration they would be willing to pay our stockholders in an acquisition transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage Venture Operating Agreement, Realogy has the right to terminate the Mortgage Venture, at its election, at any time on or after February 1, 2015 by providing two years notice to us. In addition, under the Mortgage Venture Operating Agreement, Realogy may terminate the Mortgage Venture if we effect a change in control transaction involving certain competitors or other third parties. In connection with such termination, we would be required to make a liquidated damages payment in cash to Realogy of an amount equal to the sum of (i) two times the Mortgage Ventures trailing 12 months net income (except that, in the case of a termination by Realogy following a change in control of us, we may be required to make a cash payment to Realogy in an amount equal to the Mortgage Ventures trailing 12 months net income multiplied by (a) if the Mortgage Venture Operating Agreement is terminated prior to its twelfth anniversary, the number of years remaining in the first 12 years of the term of the Mortgage Venture Operating Agreement, or (b) if the Mortgage Venture Operating Agreement is terminated on or after its tenth anniversary, two years), and (ii) all costs reasonably incurred by 44 Table of Contents Cendant and its subsidiaries in unwinding its relationship with us pursuant to the Mortgage Venture Operating Agreement and the related agreements, including the Strategic Relationship Agreement, the Marketing Agreement and the Trademark License Agreements. The existence of these termination provisions could discourage third parties from seeking to acquire us or could reduce the amount of consideration they would be willing to pay to our stockholders in an acquisition transaction. On March 14, 2007, we, along with certain of our affiliates, entered into the Consent which, among other things, provided for Realogys consent under the Realogy Agreements to the Merger, the Mortgage Sale and transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Mortgage Sale Agreement. See Item 1. BusinessArrangements with RealogyMortgage Venture Between Realogy and PHH for more information. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
