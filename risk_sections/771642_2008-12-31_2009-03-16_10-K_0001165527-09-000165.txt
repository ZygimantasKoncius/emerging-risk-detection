ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS WE ARE AN EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANY AND WE EXPECT TO INCUR OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We were incorporated in March 1982 and to date have recently been involved in the organizational activities, and acquisition of coal claims. We have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. We have not earned any revenues as of the date of this annual report. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by mineral exploration companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the exploration and development of the mineral properties that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to exploration, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. Prior to completion of our exploration stage, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if production of minerals from the claims is not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail. WE HAVE YET TO EARN REVENUE AND OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO COMPLETE THE FINAL PHASE OF OUR EXPLORATION PROGRAM IF WARRANTED. AS A RESULT, OUR ACCOUNTANT BELIEVES THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. We have accrued net losses of $735,498 for the period from the date of reinstatement on October 1, 1999 to December 31, 2008, and have no revenues to date. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of our mineral claims. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. Moore and Associates, our independent auditor, has expressed 6 substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. If we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to complete our business plan. As a result we may have to liquidate our business and you may lose your investment. You should consider our auditor's comments when determining if an investment in our company is suitable. BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE DIFFICULTIES AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN MINERAL VENTURES, WE FACE A HIGH RISK OF BUSINESS FAILURE. You should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by mineral companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the exploration and development of the mineral properties that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to exploration, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. If the results of our development program do not reveal viable commercial mineralization, we may decide to abandon our claim and acquire new claims. Our ability to acquire additional claims will be dependent upon our possessing adequate capital resources when needed. If no funding is available, we may be forced to abandon our operations. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT DANGERS INVOLVED IN MINERAL EXTRACTING, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE MAY INCUR LIABILITY OR DAMAGES AS WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. The extracting of minerals involves numerous hazards. As a result, we may become subject to liability for such hazards, including pollution, cave-ins and other hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. At the present time we have no insurance to cover against these hazards. The payment of such liabilities may result in our inability to complete our planned program and/or obtain additional financing to fund our program. AS WE UNDERTAKE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR CLAIMS, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION THAT MAY INCREASE THE ANTICIPATED COST OF OUR PROGRAM. There are several governmental regulations that materially restrict our mineral extraction program. We will be subject to the laws of the Country of Chile as we carry out our program. We may be required to obtain work permits, post bonds and perform remediation work for any physical disturbance to the area in order to comply with these laws. The cost of complying with permit and regulatory environment laws will be greater because the impact on the project area is greater. Permits and regulations will control all aspects of the production program if the project continues to that stage. Examples of regulatory requirements include: (a) Water discharge will have to meet drinking water standards; (b) Dust generation will have to be minimal or otherwise re-mediated; (c) Dumping of material on the surface will have to be re-contoured and re-vegetated with natural vegetation; (d) An assessment of all material to be left on the surface will need to be environmentally benign; (e) Ground water will have to be monitored for any potential contaminants; (f) The socio-economic impact of the project will have to be evaluated and if deemed negative, will have to be remediated; and (g) There will have to be an impact report of the work on the local fauna and flora including a study of potentially endangered species. 7 There is a risk that new regulations could increase our costs of doing business and prevent us from carrying out our exploration program. We will also have to sustain the cost of reclamation and environmental remediation for all exploration work undertaken. Both reclamation and environmental remediation refer to putting disturbed ground back as close to its original state as possible. Other potential pollution or damage must be cleaned-up and renewed along standard guidelines outlined in the usual permits. Reclamation is the process of bringing the land back to its natural state after completion of exploration activities. Environmental remediation refers to the physical activity of taking steps to remediate, or remedy, any environmental damage caused. The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know the extent of the exploration program that will be undertaken beyond completion of the recommended work program. If remediation costs exceed our cash reserves we may be unable to complete our exploration program and have to abandon our operations. IF ACCESS TO OUR MINERAL PROPERTIES IS RESTRICTED BY INCLEMENT WEATHER, WE MAY BE DELAYED IN ANY FUTURE MINING EFFORTS. It is possible that adverse weather could cause accessibility to our properties difficult and this would delay in our timetables. BASED ON CONSUMER DEMAND, THE GROWTH AND DEMAND FOR ANY ORE WE MAY RECOVER FROM OUR CLAIMS MAY BE SLOWED, RESULTING IN REDUCED REVENUES TO THE COMPANY. Our success will be dependent on the growth of demand for ores. If consumer demand slows our revenues may be significantly affected. This could limit our ability to generate revenues and our financial condition and operating results may be harmed. BECAUSE OUR CURRENT OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS, HE MAY NOT BE ABLE OR WILLING TO DEVOTE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, CAUSING OUR BUSINESS TO FAIL. Mr. Ricardo G. Munoz, our officer and director, currently devotes approximately 20 hours per week providing services to the company. While he presently possesses adequate time to attend to our interest, it is possible that the demands on him from other obligations could increase, with the result that he would no longer be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business. This could negatively impact our business development.
