ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. The shares of our common stock are highly speculative in nature, involve a high degree of risk and should be purchased only by persons who can afford to lose the entire amount invested in the common stock. Before purchasing any of the shares of common stock, you should carefully consider the following factors relating to our business and prospects. You should pay particular attention to the fact that we conduct all of our operations in China and are governed by a legal and regulatory environment that in some respects differs significantly from the environment that may prevail in the U.S. and other countries. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results will suffer, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 12 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS The recent financial crisis could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. While the financial crisis has stabilized in China, the global economy remains precarious and faces many challenges, which affect our business in a variety of ways. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, these economic conditions also impact levels of consumer spending, which may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Consumer purchases of discretionary items generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. If demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, our revenue and gross margin could be harmed. Any ill effects, product liability claims, recalls, adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding particular fruits we use as raw materials, our products or our industry in general could harm our sales and cause consumers to avoid our products. The food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination, product tampering, product recall, and consumer product liability claims. Our operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding our and our competitors products. In the event of product contamination or tampering, we may need to recall some of our products. A widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of the product for a period of time. In addition, any adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding particular fruits we use as raw materials, our products, our actions relating to our products, or our industry in general could result in a substantial drop in demand for our products. This negative public perception may include publicity regarding the safety or quality of particular fruits we use as raw materials or products in general, of other companies or of our products specifically. Negative public perception may also arise from regulatory investigations or product liability claims, regardless of whether those investigations involve us or whether any product liability claim is successful against us. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. Either a significant product recall or negative publicity, involving either our company or our competitors, could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products or the food category, and an actual or perceived loss of value of our brands, materially impacting consumer demand. Any fluctuations in raw material supply and prices may negatively impact our revenue. A secure supply of principal raw materials is crucial to our operation. Fresh fruits accounted for approximately 79% of our cost of sales in fiscal year 2011. The per unit costs of producing our products are subject to the supply and price volatility of raw materials, especially fresh fruits which are affected by factors such as weather, growing conditions and pests that are beyond our control. According to the BBIC Report, approximately 20-30% of fruit grown in China is lost. Historically, we have been able to meet our fresh fruit supply needs by building our processing facilities in close proximity to orchards and by collaborating with local government and establishing an effective group of vendors. Increases in the price of fresh fruits would negatively impact our gross margins if we are not able to offset such price increases through increases in our selling price or changes in our product mix. If we cannot maintain a consistent and cost-effective supply of source fruits, our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects will deteriorate. The availability, size, quality and cost of source fruits for the production of our products are subject to operational risks inherent to farming, such as crop size, quality, and yield fluctuation caused by poor weather and growing conditions, pest and disease problems, and other factors beyond our control. These and other operational risks could cause significant fluctuations in the availability and cost of the source fruits we use as raw materials. The prices of our fresh source fruits and other raw materials are generally determined by the market, and may change at any time. Increases in prices for any of these raw materials could have a material adverse impact on our ability to achieve profitability. 13 Currently, we source our fresh golden berries primarily from two fruit farms pursuant to cooperation agreements with local governments and other fruits from agents who procure fruit for us from individual farmers. While we believe that we have adequate sources of raw materials and that we in general maintain good supplier relationships, if we are unable to continue to find adequate suppliers for our raw materials on economic terms acceptable to us, it will adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. Product liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages. As with other manufacturers of fruit based products, we are also exposed to risks associated with product liability claims if the consumption of our products results in injury or death. Although our products have not been the subject of any product liability claims, if any such claims are brought against us, we cannot predict what impact such product liability claims or resulting negative publicity would have on our business or on our brand image. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages, diversion of management resources and require us to make significant payments and incur substantial legal expenses. We do not have product liability insurance and have not made provisions for potential product liability claims. Therefore, we may not have adequate resources to satisfy a judgment if a successful claim is brought against us. Even if a product liability claim is not successfully pursued to judgment by a claimant, we may still incur substantial legal expenses defending against such a claim and our brand image and reputation would suffer. Finally, serious product quality concerns could result in governmental actions against us, which, among other things, could result in the suspension of production or distribution of our products, loss of certain licenses, or other governmental penalties. If we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price and reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably. Recently, U.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China, particularly companies like us which have completed so-called reverse merger transactions, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Some of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits, SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on our company, our business and our stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and distract our management from growing our company. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, our company and business operations will be severely and your investment in our stock could be rendered worthless. We compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, and unless we are able to establish and maintain brand name recognition our sales may be negatively impacted. Our business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brand by our targeted consumers. In addition, our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors and consumers of our brand. Although we believe that we have made progress towards establishing market recognition for our brand 农珍之冠 in the Chinese fruit products industry, it is too early in the product life cycle of the brand to determine whether our products and brand will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. We compete in an industry characterized by rapid changes in consumer preferences, so our inability to continue developing new products to satisfy our consumers changing preferences would have a material adverse effect on our sales volumes. Our products are processed from premium specialty fruits and sell at a high price. A decline in the consumption of our products could occur as a result of a change in consumer preferences, perceptions and spending habits at any time. Future success will depend partly on our ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes and to offer, on a timely basis, new products that meet consumer preferences. Our failure to adapt our product offering to respond to such changes may result in reduced demand and lower prices for our products, resulting in a material adverse effect on our sales volumes, sales and profits. Our current market distribution and penetration is limited as compared with the potential market and so our initial views as to customer acceptance of a particular product can be erroneous, and there can be no assurance that true market acceptance will ultimately be achieved. In addition, customer preferences are also affected by factors other than taste. If we do not adjust to respond to these and other changes in customer preferences, our sales may be adversely affected. We rely primarily on third-party distributors, which could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably distribute and market our products, maintain our existing markets and expand our business into other geographic markets. We do not sell our products directly to end customers. Instead, we rely on third-party distributors for the sale and distribution of our products. As of March 31, 2011, this network consisted of approximately 44 distributors. We typically do not enter into long-term agreements with distributors and have no control over their everyday business activities. To the extent that our distributors are detracted from selling our products or do not expend sufficient efforts in managing and selling our products, our sales will be adversely affected. Our ability to maintain our distribution network and attract additional distributors will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Some of these factors include: (i) the level of demand for our brand and products in a particular distribution area; (ii) our ability to price our products at levels competitive with those offered by competing products and (iii) our ability to deliver products in the quantity and at the time ordered by distributors. 14 There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet all or any of these factors in any of our current or prospective geographic areas of distribution. Furthermore, a shortage of adequate working capital may make it impossible for us to do so. Our inability to achieve any of these factors in a geographic distribution area will have a material adverse effect on our relationships with our distributors in that particular geographic area, thus limiting our ability to maintain and expand our market, which will likely adversely effect our revenues and financial results. We generally do not have long-term agreements with our distributors, and we may need to spend significant time and incur significant expense in attracting and maintaining key distributors. Our marketing and sales strategy presently, and in the future, will rely on the performance of our independent distributors and our ability to attract additional distributors. We generally have one-year written agreements with our distributors which are renewable at the beginning of every year. In addition, despite the terms of the written agreements with certain of our significant distributors, we have no assurance as to the level of performance under those agreements, or that those agreements will not be terminated. There is also no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current distribution relationships or establish and maintain successful relationships with distributors in new geographic distribution areas. Moreover, there is the additional possibility that we will have to incur significant expenses to attract and maintain key distributors in one or more of our geographic distribution areas in order to profitably exploit our geographic markets. We may not have sufficient working capital to allow us to do so. A large percentage of our net sales has been derived from sales to a limited number of distributors, and our business will suffer if sales to these distributers decline. A significant portion of our net sales historically has been derived from a limited number of distributors. Our top ten distributors accounted for approximately 71.2% and 64.6% of our total net sales in fiscal year 2011 and 2010, respectively. In fiscal year 2011, our two biggest distributors Beijing Huanpenyuan Food Company Limited and Harbin Shengjinlai Economic and Technology Development Company Limited accounted for approximately 16.6% and 13.2% of our total net sales, respectively. Any significant reduction in demand for products manufactured by any of these major distributors and/or their customers and any decrease in their demand for our products could harm our sales and business operations. The loss of one or more of these distributors could damage our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to execute our business expansion plan could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are currently building a new fruit and vegetable powder facility in Daqing and a new factory facility in Zhaoyuan with a new multi-purpose concentrate paste production line. We also plan to build another fruit and vegetable powder production line with an expected annual production capacity of approximately 10,000 tons in Daqing. Our decision to increase our production capacity was based in part on our projections of market reception, increases in our sales volume and growth in the size of the premium specialty fruit and vegetable based product market in China. If actual customer demand does not meet our projections, we will likely suffer overcapacity problems and may have to leave capacity idle, which may reduce our overall profitability and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our future success depends on our ability to expand our business to address growth in demand for our current and future products. Our ability to add production capacity and increase output is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including: the unavailability of additional funding to expand our production capacity, purchase additional fixed assets and purchase raw materials on favorable terms or at all; delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors, many of which may be beyond our control, such as problems with equipment vendors and suppliers of raw materials; failure to maintain high quality control standards; shortage of source fruits; our inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, required approvals by relevant government authorities; diversion of significant management attention and other resources; and failure to execute our expansion plan effectively. 15 As our business grows, we will need to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, including improvements to our accounting and other internal management systems by dedicating additional resources to our reporting and accounting functions, and improvements to our record keeping and contract tracking system. We will need to respond to competitive market conditions and continue to enhance existing products and develop new products, and retain existing customers and attract new customers. We will also need to recruit more personnel and train and manage our growing employee base. Furthermore, we will need to maintain and expand our relationships with our current and future customers, suppliers, distributors and other third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will succeed. If we encounter any of the risks described above, or are otherwise unable to establish or successfully operate additional production capacity or to increase production output, we may be unable to grow our business and revenues, reduce our operating costs, maintain our competitiveness or improve our profitability, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected. Because we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate and our annual performance will depend largely on results from three quarters. Our business is highly seasonal in production, reflecting the harvest season of our primary source fruits during the months from mid-July to mid-November. Typically, a substantial portion of our revenues are earned during our second, third and forth fiscal quarters. We generally experience lowest revenues during our first fiscal quarter. Sales in the second, third and forth fiscal quarters accounted for approximately 26.7%, 25.5% and 36.8% of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, respectively. If sales in these quarters are lower than expected, our operating results would be adversely affected, and it would have a disproportionately large impact on our annual operating results. Due to our rapid growth in recent years, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance and evaluating our business and prospects may be difficult. Our business has grown and evolved rapidly in recent years as demonstrated by our growth in net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 to $87.0 million from $56.4 million for fiscal year 2009. We may not be able to achieve similar growth in future periods, and our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business, financial performance and prospects. Moreover, our ability to achieve satisfactory production results at higher volumes is unproven. Therefore, you should not rely on our past results or our historical rate of growth as an indication of our future performance. Our growth strategy may require additional capital that may not be available on favorable terms or at all. We have, in the past, sold our common stock to raise additional capital. Our business expansion requires significant capital and although we believe that our current cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our present and reasonably anticipated cash needs, we may, in the future, require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions, implementation of our strategy to expand our production capacity or other investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our own financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available as needed or, if available, on terms favorable to us. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders and such additional equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our existing common stock. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or obtain funds for required payments of interest and principal on such additional indebtedness, or if we fail to comply with our debt covenants, we will be in default. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects. We depend heavily on key personnel, and turnover of key employees and senior management could harm our business. Our future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key technical and senior management personnel, including Changjun Yu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Colman Cheng, our Chief Financial Officer. None of these key management members currently owns any shares of common stock or any other equity interest in the Company. Although they have signed employment agreements with our subsidiary Fezdale which include a non-competition provision which prohibits them from engaging in the food processing industry during the term of the agreement and for two years after the termination of employment, such employment agreements can be terminated at will. If we lose any of these key employees and are unable to find a qualified replacement in a timely manner, our business will be negatively impacted. In addition, if a key employee fails to perform in his or her current position, or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed, our business could suffer. Significant turnover in our senior management could significantly deplete the institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team. We depend on the skills and abilities of these key employees in managing the reclamation, technical, and marketing aspects of our business, any part of which could be harmed by turnover in the future. 16 The concentration of ownership of our securities by our controlling stockholders who do not participate in the management of our business can result in stockholder votes that are not in our best interests or the best interests of our minority stockholders. Mr. Yiu Fai Kung and Mr. Kwan Mo Ng, collectively beneficially own approximately 79% of our outstanding voting securities, giving them controlling interest in the Company. However, neither Mr. Kung nor Mr. Ng is an executive officer or director of the Company and is not a participant in any way in the day to day affairs of the Company. Mr. Kung and Mr. Ng may have little or no knowledge of the details of the Companys operations and do not participate in the corporate governance of the Company. In addition, this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a future change of control, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our shares. Our inability to protect our trademarks, patent and trade secrets may prevent us from successfully marketing our products and competing effectively. Failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our brands and our reputation, and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We produce, market and sell our products under 农珍之冠. We regard our intellectual property, particularly our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business and our success. We rely on a combination of trademark and trade secrecy laws, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect these proprietary rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, trade secrets (including our flavor concentrate trade secrets) or similar proprietary rights. In addition, there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us, and we may have to pursue litigation against other parties to assert our rights. Any such claim or litigation could be costly and we may lack the resources required to defend against such claims. In addition, any event that would jeopardize our proprietary rights or any claims of infringement by third parties could have a material adverse affect on our ability to market or sell our brands, and profitably exploit our products. We may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to have those controls attested to by our independent auditors. As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX 404, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the companys internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports, including Form 10-K. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a companys financial statements must also attest to the operating effectiveness of the companys internal controls. As a smaller reporting company, we are currently exempt from the auditor attestation requirements. We can provide no assurance that we will comply with all of the requirements imposed thereby. There can be no positive assurance that we will receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors, when required. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner or we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors with respect to our internal controls, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. 17 We have limited insurance coverage and do not carry any business interruption insurance, third-party liability insurance for our production facilities or insurance that covers the risk of loss of our products in shipment. Operation of our facilities involves many risks, including equipment failures, natural disasters, industrial accidents, power outages, labor disturbances and other business interruptions. Furthermore, if any of our products are faulty, then we may become subject to product liability claims or we may have to engage in a product recall. We do not carry any business interruption insurance, product recall or third-party liability insurance for our production facilities or with respect to our products to cover claims pertaining to personal injury or property or environmental damage arising from defects in our products, product recalls, accidents on our property or damage relating to our operations. Therefore, our existing insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all risks associated with our business. As a result, we may be required to pay for financial and other losses, damages and liabilities, including those caused by natural disasters and other events beyond our control, out of our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, agreements with third parties and we make most of our sales in China. PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our Company, even though they may not always be subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. 18 RISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA Adverse changes in political and economic policies of the PRC government could impede the overall economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our products and damage our business. We conduct substantially all of our operations and generate most of our revenue in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including: a higher level of government involvement; a early stage of development of the market-oriented sector of the economy; a rapid growth rate; a higher level of control over foreign exchange; and the allocation of resources. As the PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy, the PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. While these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy, they may also have a negative effect on us. Although the PRC government has in recent years implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the PRC government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in China through the allocation of resources, controlling the payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and imposing policies that impact particular industries or companies in different ways. Any adverse change in economic conditions or government policies in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth in China, which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our services and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. PRC food hygiene and safety laws may become more onerous, which may adversely affect our operations and financial performance and lead to an increase in our costs which we may be unable to pass on to our customers. Operators within the PRC fruit processing industry are subject to compliance with PRC food hygiene and safety laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations require all enterprises engaged in the production of fruit based products to obtain a hygiene license. They also set out hygiene standards with respect to food and food additives, packaging and containers, labeling on packaging as well as hygiene requirements for food production and sites, facilities and equipment used for the transportation and the sale of food. Failure to comply with PRC food hygiene and safety laws may result in fines, suspension of operations, loss of hygiene license and, in certain cases, criminal proceedings against an enterprise and its management. Although we are in compliance with current PRC food hygiene and safety laws and regulations, in the event that such laws and regulations become more stringent or widen in scope, we may fail to comply with such laws, or if we comply, our production and distribution costs may increase, and we may be unable to pass these additional costs on to our customers. Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us. We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiaries in the PRC. Our operating subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, all of our executive officers and most of our directors are residents of China and not of the United States, and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to affect service of process in the United States or to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against our Chinese operations and subsidiary. 19 You may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us. We are a Nevada holding company and most of our assets are located outside of the United States. Substantially all of our current operations are conducted in the PRC. In addition, most of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, most of whom are not residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts. Grandall Legal Group, our counsel as to PRC law, has advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. Courts in China may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other arrangements that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security or the public interest. So it is uncertain whether a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States. If we are found to have failed to comply with applicable laws, we may incur additional expenditures or be subject to significant fines and penalties. Our operations are subject to PRC laws and regulations applicable to us. However, many PRC laws and regulations are uncertain in their scope, and the implementation of such laws and regulations in different localities could have significant differences. In certain instances, local implementation rules and/or the actual implementation are not necessarily consistent with the regulations at the national level. Although we strive to comply with all the applicable PRC laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC government authorities will not later determine that we have not been in compliance with certain laws or regulations. In addition, our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the PRC State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the PRC State Administration of Taxation, the PRC Ministry of Health and Hygiene Permitting Office, the PRC General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, and the PRC State Food and Drug Administration Bureau relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products. Our failure to comply with these and other applicable laws and regulations in China could subject us to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, as well as civil remedies, including fines, injunctions and recalls of our products. It is possible that changes to such laws or more rigorous enforcement of such laws or with respect to our current or past practices could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, additional environmental, health or safety issues relating to matters that are not currently known to management may result in unanticipated liabilities and expenditures. The PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. The PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures. 20 Future inflation in China may inhibit our ability to conduct business in China. In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and highly fluctuating rates of inflation. These factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our products and our company. Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales revenue effectively. Substantially all our sales revenue and expenses are denominated in RMB. Under PRC law, the RMB is currently convertible under the current account, which includes dividends and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the capital account, which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Currently, our PRC operating subsidiary may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future. Since a significant amount of our future revenue will be denominated in RMB, any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in RMB to fund our business activities outside China that are denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange transactions by our PRC operating subsidiary under the capital account continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of or need to register with PRC government authorities, including SAFE. In particular, if our PRC operating subsidiary borrows foreign currency through loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must be registered with SAFE, and if we finance the subsidiary by means of additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be approved by certain government authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, or their respective local counterparts. These limitations could affect their ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing. Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities. The value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars, as well as earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future. Since July 2005, the RMB has no longer been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the Peoples Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market. Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies. Restrictions under PRC law on our PRC subsidiaries ability to make dividends and other distributions could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business, pay dividends to you, and otherwise fund and conduct our businesses. Substantially all of our revenues are earned by our PRC subsidiaries. However, PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent companies. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividend by our PRC subsidiaries only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our PRC subsidiaries are also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of their respective annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with PRC GAAP to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in said fund reaches 50% of their respective registered capital. Allocations to these statutory reserve funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business. 21 Failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident stockholders to personal liability, limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially adversely affect us. Our ability to conduct foreign-exchange activities in the PRC is subject to uncertainties surrounding the interpretation of SAFE regulations, one of which is Circular 75. Under the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Return Investment Through Special Purpose Companies by Residents Inside China (as amended and supplemented, Circular 75), PRC residents must register with a local branch of SAFE (1) before they establish or gain control of an overseas special purpose vehicle, or SPV, for the purpose of overseas equity financing (including convertible debt financing); (2) when they contribute their assets or equity interests in a domestic enterprise to an SPV or engage in overseas financing after contributing assets or equity interests to an SPV; and (3) when their SPV undergoes a material change outside of China, such as a change in share capital or merger or acquisition. If any PRC resident who holds stock in an SPV fails to make the required SAFE registration and make any amended registration, the onshore PRC subsidiaries of that offshore company may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore SPV. Failure to comply with the SAFE registration and amendment registration requirements described above could result in liability for evading PRC laws applicable to foreign exchange restrictions. We have advised our shareholders who are PRC residents, as defined in Circular 75, to register with the relevant branch of SAFE, as currently required, in connection with their equity interests in us and our acquisitions of equity interests in our PRC subsidiaries. However, we cannot provide any assurances that their existing registrations have fully complied with, and they have made all necessary amendments to their registration to fully comply with, all applicable registrations or approvals required by Circular 75. Moreover, because of uncertainty over how Circular 75 will be interpreted and implemented, and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us, we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. For example, our present and prospective PRC subsidiaries ability to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with Circular 75 by our PRC resident beneficial holders. In addition, such PRC residents may not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by Circular 75. We also have little control over either our present or prospective direct or indirect shareholders or the outcome of such registration procedures. A failure by our PRC resident beneficial holders or future PRC resident shareholders to comply with Circular 75, if SAFE requires it, could subject these PRC resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our subsidiaries ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects. The M&A Rule establishes more complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China. On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the CSRC, promulgated the Provisions Regarding Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rule, which became effective on September 8, 2006 and was amended on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rule establishes additional procedures and requirements that could make some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction and in some situations, require approval of MOFCOM when a foreign investor takes control of a Chinese domestic enterprise. In the future, we may grow our business in part by acquiring complementary businesses, although we do not have any plans to do so at this time. The M&A Rule also requires MOFCOM antitrust review of any change-of-control transactions involving certain types of foreign acquirers. Complying with the requirements of the M&A Rule to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from MOFCOM, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share. 22 We face uncertainty from the Circular on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax on Non-resident Enterprises Share Transfer (Circular 698) released in December 2009 by China's State Administration of Taxation (SAT), effective as of January 1, 2008. Where a foreign investor indirectly transfers equity interests in a Chinese resident enterprise by selling the shares in an offshore holding company, and the latter is located in a country (jurisdiction) where the effective tax burden is less than 12.5% or where the offshore income of its residents is not taxable, the foreign investor must provide the PRC tax authority in charge of that Chinese resident enterprise with the relevant information within 30 days of the transfer. Where a foreign investor indirectly transfers equity interests in a Chinese resident enterprise through the abuse of form of organization and there are no reasonable commercial purposes for such form with the result that the corporate income tax liability is avoided, the PRC tax authorities shall have the power to reassess the nature of the equity transfer in accordance with the substance-over-form principle and deny the existence of an offshore holding company that is used for tax planning purposes. Income derived from equity transfers as mentioned in this circular refers to income derived by nonresident enterprises from direct or indirect transfers of equity interest in China resident enterprises, excluding shares in Chinese resident enterprises that are bought and sold openly on the stock exchange. While the term indirectly transfer is not defined, we understand that the relevant PRC tax authorities have jurisdiction regarding requests for information over a wide range of foreign entities having no direct contact with China. The relevant PRC tax authorities have not yet promulgated any formal provisions or formally declared or stated how to calculate the effective tax in the offshore country (jurisdiction) and to what extent and the process of the disclosure to the PRC tax authority in charge of that Chinese resident enterprise. Meanwhile, there are not any formal declarations with regard to how to decide abuse of form of organization and reasonable commercial purpose, which can be utilized by us to determine if our company complies with the Circular 698. Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a resident enterprise of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders. China passed a new Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and its implementing rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with de facto management bodies within China is considered a resident enterprise, meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management as substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties of the enterprise. On April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or the Notice, further interpreting the application of the EIT Law and its implementation non-Chinese enterprise or group controlled offshore entities. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a non-domestically incorporated resident enterprise if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) its substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate chops, board and shareholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often resident in China. A resident enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10% when paying dividends to its non-PRC stockholders. However, detailed measures on imposition of tax from non-domestically incorporated resident enterprises are still unavailable. Therefore, it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case. We may be deemed to be a resident enterprise by Chinese tax authorities. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. 23 First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as interest on financing proceeds and non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the EIT Law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiary would qualify as tax-exempt income, we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new resident enterprise classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC stockholders from transferring our shares. We are actively monitoring the possibility of resident enterprise treatment and are evaluating appropriate organizational changes to avoid this treatment, to the extent reasonably possible. If we were treated as a resident enterprise by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and China, and our PRC tax may not be creditable against our U.S. tax. RISKS RELATED TO THE MARKET FOR OUR STOCK GENERALLY The market price of our common stock is volatile, leading to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when you may want to sell your holdings. The market price of our common stock is volatile, and this volatility may continue. Numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. In addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for our common stock may be highly volatile for specific business reasons. Factors such as variations in our revenues, earnings and cash flow, announcements of new investments, cooperation arrangements or acquisitions, and fluctuations in market prices for our products could cause the market price for our shares to change substantially. Securities class action litigation is often instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our managements attention and resources. Moreover, the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock, the market price for our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which, in turn, could cause the market price for our common stock or trading volume to decline. Furthermore, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock and other interests in our company at a time when you want to sell your interest in us. The market price of our stock may be affected by low volume. Although our common stock is traded on the NYSE Amex, the trading volume of our common stock has generally been low. Reported average daily trading volume in our common stock for the three month period ended June 20, 2011 was approximately 20,633 shares. Limited trading volume will subject our shares of common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock at a price that is attractive to them. Certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation may make it more difficult for a third party to effect a change-of-control. Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the board of directors without further action by the stockholders. These terms may include preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock, and therefore could reduce the value of such common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent or make it more costly to acquire or effect a change-in-control, which in turn could prevent our stockholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable offer is extended and could materially and negatively affect the market price of our common stock. 24 ITEM 1B.
