ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect Ashland’s business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K. The following discussion of risks is designed to highlight what Ashland believes are important factors to consider when evaluating its expectations. These factors could cause future results to differ from those in forward-looking statements and from historical trends.8Adverse developments in the global economy and potential disruptions of financial markets could negatively impact Ashland’s customers and suppliers, and therefore have a negative impact on Ashland’s revenues and profitability. A global or regional economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit Ashland’s ability to produce and sell products. Ashland’s business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to global and regional economic downturns, credit market tightness, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates and other challenges that can affect the global economy. During an adverse event, Ashland’s customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, reduced demand for their products, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing or potential customers might delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to Ashland in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers may experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to Ashland. If the current weakness in much of the global economy continues for an extended period or deepens significantly, Ashland’s business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to grow could be negatively impacted. The competitive nature of Ashland’s markets may delay or prevent the Company from passing increases in raw materials costs on to its customers. In addition, certain of Ashland’s suppliers may be unable to deliver products or raw materials or may withdraw from contractual arrangements. The occurrence of either event could adversely affect Ashland’s results of operations. Rising and volatile raw material prices, especially those of hydrocarbon derivatives, guar, cotton linters or wood pulp, may negatively impact Ashland’s costs. Similarly, energy costs are a significant component of certain of Ashland’s product costs. Ashland is not always able to raise prices in response to such increased costs, and its ability to pass on the costs of such price increases is dependent upon market conditions. Likewise, Ashland purchases certain products and raw materials from suppliers, often pursuant to written supply contracts. If those suppliers are unable to timely meet Ashland’s orders or choose to terminate or otherwise avoid contractual arrangements, Ashland may not be able to make alternative supply arrangements. Also, domestic and global government regulations related to the manufacture or transport of certain raw materials may impede Ashland’s ability to obtain those raw materials on commercially reasonable terms. If Ashland is unable to obtain and retain qualified suppliers under commercially acceptable terms, its ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely, competitive and profitable manner or grow its business successfully could be adversely affected. Ashland faces competition from other companies, which places downward pressure on prices and margins and may otherwise adversely affect Ashland’s business. Ashland operates in highly competitive markets, competing against a number of domestic and foreign companies. Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service, as well as the ability to bring innovative products or services to the marketplace. Certain key competitors are significantly larger than Ashland and have greater financial resources, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the relevant industry, changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and changes in general economic conditions. In addition, competitors’ pricing decisions could compel Ashland to decrease its prices, which could negatively affect its margins and profitability. Additional competition in markets served by Ashland could adversely affect margins and profitability and could lead to a reduction in market share. Also, Ashland competes in certain markets that are declining and has targeted other markets for growth opportunity. If Ashland’s strategies for dealing with declining markets and leveraging opportunity markets are not successful, its results of operations could be negatively affected.Ashland’s substantial global operations subject it to risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Nearly one half of Ashland’s net sales for fiscal 2013 are expected to be to customers outside of North America. Ashland expects sales from international markets to continue to represent an even larger portion of the Company’s net sales in the future. Ashland has approximately 45 manufacturing facilities located outside of the United States. Accordingly, Ashland’s business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, cultural, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. The global nature of Ashland’s business presents difficulties in hiring and maintaining a workforce in certain countries. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided in foreign countries. In addition, foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax Ashland’s foreign income, or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls. The imposition of tariffs is also a risk that could impair Ashland’s financial performance. Certain legal and political risks are also inherent in the operation of a company with Ashland’s global scope. For example, it may be more difficult for Ashland to enforce its agreements or collect receivables through foreign legal systems. There is a risk 9that foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises in certain countries where Ashland operates. In certain countries or regions, terrorist activities and the response to such activities may threaten Ashland’s operations more than in those in the United States. Social and cultural norms in certain countries may not support compliance with Ashland’s corporate policies. Also, changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where Ashland operates, particularly in Europe, the Middle East and emerging markets, are a risk to Ashland’s financial performance. As Ashland continues to operate its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to its multinational operations will not have an adverse effect on Ashland’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact Ashland’s financial performance and restrict its ability to operate its business or execute its strategies. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase Ashland’s cost of doing business and restrict its ability to operate its business or execute its strategies. This includes, among other things, the possible taxation under U.S. law of certain income from foreign operations, regulations issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (and analogous non-U.S. agencies) affecting Ashland and its customers, compliance with The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (and analogous non-U.S. laws) and costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Ashland’s business exposes it to potential product liability claims and recalls, which could adversely affect its financial condition and performance. The development, manufacture and sale of specialty chemical products by Ashland, including products produced as food or personal care ingredients or with pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement applications, involve an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls, product seizures and related adverse publicity. A product liability claim or judgment against Ashland could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, affect consumer or customer confidence in its products, and divert management’s attention from other responsibilities. Although Ashland maintains product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that Ashland will be able to continue to maintain its existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. A product recall or a partially or completely uninsured product liability judgment against Ashland could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. Ashland’s success depends upon its ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management. Ashland’s success depends on its ability to attract and retain key personnel, and Ashland relies heavily on its management team. The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect Ashland’s operations. Also, approximately one-third of Ashland’s U.S. based employees will be retirement-eligible within the next five years, which increases the risk that key employees could leave the Company. This risk of unwanted employee turnover also exists in developing markets which Ashland has targeted for growth, especially in Asia, South America and Eastern Europe. In addition, because of its reliance on its management team, Ashland’s future success depends, in part, on its ability to identify and develop talent to succeed its senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critical to the successful implementation of Ashland’s strategies. Business disruptions could seriously harm Ashland’s operations and financial performance. Business disruptions, including those related to operating hazards inherent with the production of chemicals, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, supply disruptions, increasing costs for energy, temporary plant and/or power outages, information technology systems and network disruptions, terrorist attacks, armed conflict, war, pandemic diseases, fires, floods or other catastrophic events, could seriously harm Ashland’s operations, as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers, and adversely impact Ashland’s financial performance. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrence or consequences of any such events, they could result in reduced demand for Ashland’s products, make it difficult or impossible for Ashland to manufacture its products or deliver products and services to its customers or to receive raw materials from suppliers, or create delays and inefficiencies in the supply chain. While Ashland maintains business continuity plans that are intended to allow it to continue operations or mitigate the effect of events that could disrupt its business, Ashland cannot provide assurances that its plans would fully protect it from all such events. In addition, insurance maintained by Ashland to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from business disruptions is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of Ashland’s damages or damages to others in the event Ashland’s business is disrupted. In addition, insurance related to these types of risks may not be available now or, if available, may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable rates. 10Failure to develop and market new products and production technologies could impact Ashland’s competitive position and have an adverse effect on its revenues and profitability.The specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements. In order to maintain margins and remain competitive, Ashland must successfully develop and introduce new products or improvements that appeal to its customers, and ultimately to global consumers. Ashland plans to grow earnings, in part, by focusing on developing markets and solutions to meet increasing demand in those markets, including demand for personal care and pharmaceutical products. Ashland’s efforts to respond to changes in consumer demands in a timely and cost-efficient manner to drive earnings could be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, including the inability to identify viable new products, successfully complete research and development, obtain regulatory approvals, obtain intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. Due to the lengthy development process, technological challenges and intense competition, there can be no assurance that any of the products Ashland is currently developing, or could develop in the future, will achieve substantial commercial success. Ashland has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial operating costs and capital expenditures as a result of environmental, health and safety, and hazardous substances liabilities and requirements, which could reduce Ashland’s profitability. Ashland is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment and human health and safety, and the generation, storage, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. Ashland has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. Environmental, health and safety regulations change frequently, and such regulations and their enforcement have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and the enforcement of such laws and regulations could interrupt Ashland’s operations, require modifications to its facilities or cause Ashland to incur significant liabilities, costs or losses that could adversely affect its profitability. Actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws and regulations could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations as well as substantial damages, penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions and remediation costs. In addition, under some environmental laws, Ashland may be strictly liable and/or jointly and severally liable for environmental damages and penalties. Ashland is also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively environmental remediation) at multiple locations. Ashland uses engineering studies, historical experience and other factors to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect Ashland’s ability to estimate its share of the applicable costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites. As a result, Ashland’s actual costs for environmental remediation could exceed its reserves and, therefore, adversely affect Ashland’s financial performance. Ashland is responsible for, and has financial exposure to, liabilities from pending and threatened claims, including those alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos, which reduce Ashland’s cash flows and could reduce profitability. There are various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings pending or threatened, including those alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos, against Ashland and its current and former subsidiaries. Such actions are with respect to commercial matters, product liability, toxic tort liability and other matters that seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. While these actions are being contested, their outcome is not predictable. Ashland’s businesses could be adversely affected by financial exposure to these liabilities. Insurance maintained by Ashland to protect against claims for damages alleged by third parties is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of Ashland’s liabilities to others. In addition, insurance related to these types of risks may not be available now or, if available, may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable rates. Projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict. In addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received, other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant, the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure, dismissal rates, costs of medical treatment, the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co-defendants in claims, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards. Furthermore, any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. In light of these inherent uncertainties, Ashland believes that its asbestos reserves represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes. As a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs, a range of long-term cost models 11was developed. These models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long-term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs, as well as other variables mentioned previously. Because of the inherent uncertainties in projecting future asbestos liabilities and establishing appropriate reserves, Ashland’s actual asbestos costs may exceed its reserves, which could adversely affect its profitability and financial performance. Ashland may not be able to effectively protect or enforce its intellectual property rights. Ashland relies on the patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws of the United States and other countries to protect its intellectual property rights. The laws of some countries may not protect Ashland’s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect Ashland’s intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could result in the loss of valuable proprietary information, which could have an adverse effect on Ashland’s business and results of operations. Even in circumstances where Ashland has a patent on certain technologies, such patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competing technologies. In addition, any patent applications submitted by Ashland may not result in an issued patent. There can be no assurance that Ashland’s intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Ashland could also face claims from third parties alleging that Ashland’s products or processes infringe on their proprietary rights. If Ashland is found liable for infringement, it could be responsible for significant damages, prohibited from using certain products or processes or required to modify certain products and processes. Any such infringement liability could adversely affect Ashland’s product and service offerings, profitability and results of operations. Ashland also protects its know-how and trade secrets by entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with most of its employees and third parties. There can be no assurance that such agreements will not be breached or that Ashland will be able to effectively enforce them. Any unauthorized disclosure of any of Ashland’s material know-how or trade secrets could adversely affect Ashland’s business and results of operations. Ashland may not realize the anticipated benefits of the ISP acquisition. Ashland’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the ISP acquisition will depend, in part, on its ability to integrate the businesses of ISP successfully and efficiently with Ashland’s businesses. The combination of two independent companies is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. ISP does not utilize an SAP™ enterprise resource planning system (ERP). Extensive planning is underway to support the effective implementation of the ERP system in the former ISP businesses; however, such implementations carry certain risks, including potential business interruption with the associated adverse impact on operating income. The failure of the combined company to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the ISP acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect Ashland’s business or results of operations. Such benefits also may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Ashland’s pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations are currently underfunded, and Ashland may have to make significant cash payments to some or all of these plans, which would reduce the cash available for Ashland’s businesses. Ashland has unfunded obligations under its domestic and foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans. The funded status of Ashland’s pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which would reduce the cash available for Ashland’s businesses. In addition, a decrease in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of Ashland’s pension plans and future contributions, as well as the periodic pension cost in subsequent fiscal years. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC, has the authority to terminate an underfunded tax-qualified pension plan under limited circumstances. In the event Ashland’s tax-qualified pension plans are terminated by the PBGC, Ashland could be liable to the PBGC for some portion of the underfunded amount. Ashland’s substantial indebtedness may adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition, and Ashland’s restrictive debt covenants may affect its ability to successfully operate its businesses. Primarily as a result of the acquisition of ISP, Ashland incurred a substantial amount of debt. Ashland’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things: •requiring Ashland to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on its debt, which would reduce the availability of Ashland’s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, execution of its growth strategy and other general corporate purposes;12•limiting Ashland’s ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of its growth strategy and other purposes;•making Ashland more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and regulatory conditions and in its business by limiting Ashland’s flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult for Ashland to react quickly to, changing conditions;•placing Ashland at a competitive disadvantage compared with those of its competitors that have less debt and lower debt service requirements;•making Ashland more vulnerable to increases in interest rates since some of its indebtedness is subject to variable rates of interest; and•making it more difficult for Ashland to satisfy its financial obligations.In addition, Ashland may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to repay its indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet its other cash needs. If Ashland is not able to pay its debts as they become due, it could be in default under its credit facility or other indebtedness. Ashland might also be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies to repay indebtedness, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring its indebtedness or selling additional debt or equity securities. Ashland may not be able to refinance its debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or its assets on favorable terms, if at all, and if Ashland must sell its assets, it may negatively affect its ability to generate revenues. Ashland’s debt facilities contain various covenants that limit its ability to, among other things: grant liens; incur additional indebtedness; provide guarantees; engage in mergers and acquisitions; sell, transfer and otherwise dispose of property and assets; make loans; invest in joint ventures and other investments; declare dividends, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; change the nature of Ashland’s business; and enter into transactions with its affiliates. In addition, Ashland is required to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests specified in its senior credit facility. If Ashland does not adhere to these covenants, the lenders may have the right to declare a default and could require immediate payment of all debts outstanding or seek other remedies available to them under the debt facilities.
