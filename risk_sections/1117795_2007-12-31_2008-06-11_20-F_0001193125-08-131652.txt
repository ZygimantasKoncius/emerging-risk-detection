Compensation The aggregate amount of compensation that we paid to our directors and executive officers in 2007 for services performed as directors, officers or employees was approximately HK$35 million (US$4.5 million). We adopted a share option scheme on October 8, 1997, or the Old Scheme, pursuant to which our directors may, at their discretion, invite our employees, including executive directors, or employees of our subsidiaries, to take up options to subscribe for ordinary shares up to a maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares equal to 10% of our total issued share capital. Pursuant to a resolution passed at the annual general meeting held on June 24, 2002, the Old Scheme was terminated and a new share option scheme, or the Current Scheme, was adopted. The purpose of the Current Scheme is to provide the Company with a flexible and effective means of remunerating and providing benefits to the employees, the executive directors and the non-executive directors of the Company, any of its holdings companies and their respective subsidiaries and any entity in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries holds any equity interest, thereby providing incentives to these participants. Under the Current Scheme, the directors of the Company may, at their discretion, invite the plan participants to take up options to subscribe for the ordinary shares of the Company. The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which can be subscribed pursuant to options that are or may be granted under the above schemes equals to 10% of the total issued share capital of the Company as at the date of adoption of the Current Scheme. Options lapsed or cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Old Scheme or the Current Scheme will not be counted for the purpose of calculating this 10% limit. 50 Table of Contents As the Old Scheme was terminated with effect on June 24, 2002, no further options were granted under the Old Scheme thereafter. Under the Old Scheme, all options not exercised on or before October 7, 2007 have lapsed. Accordingly, as at December 31, 2007, there were no outstanding options granted under the Old Scheme. As at the same date, the total number of ordinary shares which may be issued on the exercise of the outstanding options granted or to be granted under the Current Scheme is 1,510,285,254. No share options were granted under the Current Scheme during the year ended December 31, 2007. The consideration payable for the grant of option under each of the Old Scheme and the Current Scheme is HK$1.00. For options granted before September 1, 2001 under the Old Scheme, the exercise price of the options was determined by the directors of the Company at their discretion provided that such price may not be set below a minimum price which is the higher of: (i) the nominal value of a share; and (ii) 80% of the average of the closing price of the ordinary share on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the option was granted. For options granted under the Current Scheme, the exercise price of the options are determined by the directors of the Company at their discretion provided that such price may not be set below a minimum price which is the highest of: (i) the nominal value of an ordinary share; (ii) the closing price of the ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on the date on which the option was granted; and (iii) the average closing price of the ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the option was granted. Under the Old Scheme, all options not exercised have lapsed by December 31, 2007, and under the Current Scheme, the term of the option is determined by the directors at their discretion, provided that all options shall be exercised within 10 years after the date on which the option is granted. As of December 31, 2007, the directors and employees of the Company had options to subscribe for the ordinary shares of the Company granted under the Current Scheme. In 2007, 64,090,450 of these options had been exercised. See Share Ownership below for details on options granted to our directors.
