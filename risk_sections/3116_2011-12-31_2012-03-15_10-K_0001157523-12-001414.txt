Item 1A. Risk Factors. We depend on a small number of distributors, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect. A small number of large wholesale drug distributors account for a significant portion of our gross sales, net revenues and accounts receivable. The following three wholesalers – AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal and McKesson – accounted for approximately 66% of total gross sales and 63% of total net revenues in 2011, and 72% of gross trade receivables as of December 31, 2011. In addition to acting as distributors of our products, these three companies also distribute a broad range of health care products on behalf of many other companies. The loss of our relationship with one or more of these wholesalers, together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users, could have a material negative impact on our revenue and results of operations. A change in purchasing patterns or inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also could have a material negative impact on our revenue, results of operations and cash flows. Our growth depends on our ability to timely develop additional pharmaceutical products and manufacturing capabilities. Our strategy for growth is dependent upon our ability to develop products that can be promoted through current marketing and distributions channels and, when appropriate, the enhancement of such marketing and distribution channels. We may fail to meet our anticipated time schedule for the filing of ANDAs and NDAs or may decide not to pursue ANDAs or NDAs that we have submitted or anticipate submitting. Our internal development of new pharmaceutical products is dependent upon the research and development capabilities of our personnel and our strategic business alliance infrastructure. There can be no assurance that we or our strategic business alliances will successfully develop new pharmaceutical products or, if developed, successfully integrate new products into our existing product lines. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will receive all necessary FDA approvals or that such approvals will not involve delays, which adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products. Our failure to develop new products, to maintain substantial compliance with FDA compliance guidelines or to receive FDA approval of ANDAs or NDAs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to extensive government regulations that increase our costs and could subject us to fines, prevent us from selling our products or prevent us from operating our facilities. Federal and state government agencies regulate virtually all aspects of our business. The development, testing, manufacturing, processing, quality, safety, efficacy, packaging, labeling, record keeping, distribution, storage and advertising of our products, and disposal of waste products arising from such activities, are subject to regulation by the FDA, DEA, FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. Similar state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over these activities. Noncompliance with applicable United States and/or state or local regulatory requirements can result in fines, injunctions, penalties, mandatory recalls or seizures, suspensions of production, recommendations by the FDA against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. New, modified and additional regulations, statutes or legal interpretation, if any, could, among other things, require changes to manufacturing methods, expanded or different labeling, the recall, replacement or discontinuation of certain products, additional record keeping and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation. Such changes or new legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 1. Business — “Government Regulation.” We are subject to regulation by the FDA. All pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us, are subject to regulation by the FDA under the authority of the FDC Act. Under the FDC Act, the federal government has extensive administrative and judicial enforcement authority over the activities of finished drug product manufacturers to ensure compliance with FDA regulations. This authority includes, but is not limited to, the authority to initiate court action to seize unapproved or non-complying products, to enjoin non-complying activities, to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cGMP, to recall products, to seek civil and monetary penalties and to criminally prosecute violators. Other enforcement activities include refusal to approve product applications or the withdrawal of previously approved applications. Any such enforcement activities, including the restriction or prohibition on sales of products we market or the halting of our manufacturing operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, product recalls may be issued at our discretion, or at the request of the FDA or other government agencies having regulatory authority for pharmaceutical products. Recalls may occur due to disputed labeling claims, manufacturing issues, quality defects or other reasons. No assurance can be given that restriction or prohibition on sales, halting of manufacturing operations or recalls of our pharmaceutical products will not occur in the future. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such actions, in certain circumstances, could constitute an event of default under the terms of our various financing relationships. 11 We must obtain approval from the FDA for each pharmaceutical product that we market which requires a regulatory submission. The FDA approval process is typically lengthy, and approval is never certain. Our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval. Even if the FDA or another regulatory agency approves a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell and distribute a product or may require post-marketing studies or impose other post-marketing obligations. We and our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing, distribution, and promotion of pharmaceutical products. The FDA imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy. The FDA also regulates drug labeling and the advertising of prescription drugs. A finding by a governmental agency or court that we are not in compliance with FDA requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the FDA changes its regulatory position, it could force us to delay or suspend our manufacturing, distribution or sales of certain products. FDA interpretations of existing or pending regulations and standards may change over time with the advancement of associated technologies, industry trends, and/or prevailing scientific rationale. If the FDA changes its regulatory position due to such factors, it could result in our delay or suspension of the manufacturing, distribution or sales of certain of our products. We believe that all of our current products are in substantial compliance with FDA regulations and have received the requisite agency approvals for their manufacture and sale. In addition, modifications or enhancements of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional FDA approvals which may or may not be granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process. Any change in the FDA’s enforcement policy or any decision by the FDA to require an approved NDA or ANDA for one of our products not currently subject to the approved NDA or ANDA requirements or any delay in the FDA approving an NDA or ANDA for one of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A limited number of products we market are non-application drugs that are manufactured and marketed without FDA-issued ANDAs or NDAs on the basis of their having been marketed by industry prior to the 1962 Amendment of the FDC Act. These products have routinely been disclosed to FDA by Akorn. The regulatory status of these products is subject to change and/or challenge by the FDA, which could establish new standards and limitations for manufacturing and marketing of such products, or challenge the evidence of prior manufacturing and marketing upon which grandfathering status is based. Any such change in the status of such product could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to extensive DEA regulation, which could result in our being fined or otherwise penalized. We also manufacture and sell drugs which are “controlled substances” as defined in the federal Controlled Substances Act and similar state laws, which impose, among other things, certain licensing, security and record keeping requirements administered by the DEA and similar state agencies, as well as quotas for the manufacture, purchase and sale of controlled substances. The DEA could limit or reduce the amount of controlled substances which we are permitted to manufacture and market. See Item 1. Business – “DEA Regulation”. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions and may face difficulties in integrating them, which could adversely affect our operating results, increase costs and place a significant strain on our management. If we fail to manage the integration of our domestic and international acquisitions and achieve expected synergies, our business could be disrupted and our operating results could be negatively impacted. The operating success of both our domestic and international acquisitions involves the integration of products, processes and personnel into our existing model. In addition, the integration of international acquisitions requires both establishing and training a local management team and overseeing the operations remotely, and can involve cultural, monetary and systems challenges. Our personnel, systems, procedures, or controls may not be adequate to support both our ongoing business and the acquired businesses. If our newly-acquired businesses require a disproportionate share of our resources and management’s attention, our overall financial results may suffer. 12 We may not generate cash flow sufficient to pay interest on our outstanding convertible senior notes or repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change. In June 2011, we issued $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2016 (the “Notes”). The Notes require us to make semi-annual coupon interest payments of $2.1 million on June 1 and December 1 of each year until the Notes mature on June 1, 2016. If we do not generate sufficient operating cash flows to fund these payments or obtain additional funding from external sources at acceptable terms, we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy our interest payment obligations when those obligations are due. If a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes. If we fail to repurchase the Notes when required, we will be in default under the indenture that governs the Notes. We may need to obtain additional capital to continue to grow our business. It is possible that we will require additional funds in order to materially grow our business. We require substantial liquidity to implement long-term cost savings and productivity improvement plans, continue capital spending to improve our manufacturing plants to increase capacity and support product development programs, meet scheduled term debt and lease maturities, and run our normal business operations. We may seek additional funds through public and private financing, including equity and debt offerings. However, adequate funds through the financial markets or from other sources may not be available to us when needed or on terms favorable to us. Without sufficient additional capital funding, we may be required to delay, scale back or abandon some or all of our product development, manufacturing, acquisition, licensing and marketing initiatives, or operations. Further, such additional financing, if obtained, may require the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the common stock and result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of the common stockholders and could include covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to operate or expand our business in a manner that we deem to be in our best interest. We have entered into several strategic business alliances that may not result in marketable products. We have entered into several strategic business alliances that have been formed to supply us with low cost finished dosage form products. Since 2004, we have entered into various purchase and supply agreements and license agreements that are all designed to provide finished dosage form products that can be marketed through our distribution pipeline. There can be no assurance that these agreements will result in additional FDA-approved ANDAs or NDAs, or that we will be able to market any such additional products at a profit. In addition, any clinical trial expenses that we incur may result in adverse financial consequences to our business. Availability under our Credit Agreement may be restricted if we fail to meet our covenant requirements. We are party to a revolving Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., (the “Agent”) and other financial institutions (collectively with the Agent, the “BoA Lenders”) through which we obtained a $20.0 million revolving line of credit (the “BoA Credit Facility”), which includes a $2.0 million letter of credit facility. We may request expansion of the BoA Credit Facility from time to time in increments of at least $5.0 million up to a maximum commitment of $35.0 million, so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. The facility matures in March 2016. We may early terminate the BoA Lenders’ commitments under the BoA Credit Facility upon 90 days’ notice to the Agent at any time after the first year. Availability under the revolving credit line is equal to the lesser of (a) $20.0 million reduced by outstanding letter of credit obligations or (b) the amount of a Borrowing Base (as defined in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement) determined by reference to the value of the Borrowers’ eligible accounts receivable, eligible inventory and fixed assets as of the closing date and the end of each calendar month thereafter. The BoA Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type, including, but not limited to, limitations on: distributions; additional borrowings and liens; additional investments and asset sales; and fundamental changes to corporate structure or organization documents. The financial covenants require the Borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.1 to 1.0 during any period commencing on the date that an event of default occurs or availability under the BoA Credit Agreement is less than 15% of the aggregate BoA Lenders’ commitments under the BoA Credit Agreement. During the term of the agreement, we must provide the Agent with monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements, monthly compliance certificates, annual budget projections and copies of press releases and SEC filings. Should we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants, availability under the Credit Agreement could be restricted which would negatively impact our liquidity and may require us to seek additional sources of capital in order to maintain our continuing operations or to fund growth opportunities. Our growth and profitability is dependent on our ability to successfully utilize our existing cash reserves and operating cash flows to complete strategic acquisitions or to identify, acquire or develop, new product to market and distribute. We continue to seek growth opportunities, either by completing strategic acquisitions or by developing and introducing new pharmaceutical products. Continued improvement in our financial performance is dependent on our ability to introduce new products on an ongoing basis, whether developed internally or by third party partners, or acquired from other companies. Any delays or an inability to successfully identify suitable acquisition targets, or acquire or develop, and market and distribute new products may result in adverse financial consequences to our business. Our success depends on the development of generic and off-patent pharmaceutical products, which are particularly susceptible to competition, substitution policies and reimbursement policies. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify suitable branded pharmaceutical products to target for development of generic equivalents, determine or anticipate the dates when these branded pharmaceuticals are expected to come off patent, and time our product development activities accordingly so that we will be ready to manufacture and market our generic equivalent products at the most advantageous times. Generic pharmaceuticals must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals, even though these equivalent pharmaceuticals are sold at prices that are significantly lower than branded pharmaceuticals. Generic substitution is regulated by the federal and state governments, as is reimbursement for generic drug dispensing. There can be no assurance that substitution will be permitted for newly approved generic drugs or that such products will be subject to government reimbursement. In addition, generic products developed by other third parties may render our generic products noncompetitive or obsolete, or may glut the market with competing products resulting in a reduction in sale price or market share for the generic products we sell. There can be no assurance that we will be able to consistently bring generic pharmaceutical products to market quickly and efficiently in the future. An increase in competition in the sale of generic pharmaceutical products or our failure to bring such products to market before our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 13 Further, there is no proprietary protection for most of the branded pharmaceutical products that either we or other pharmaceutical companies sell. In addition, governmental and cost-containment pressures regarding the dispensing of generic equivalents will likely result in generic substitution and competition generally for our branded pharmaceutical products. We attempt to mitigate the effect of this substitution through, among other things, creation of strong brand-name recognition and product-line extensions for our branded pharmaceutical products, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. We can be subject to legal proceedings against us, which may prove costly and time-consuming even if without merit. In the ordinary course of our business, we can be involved in legal actions with both private parties and certain government agencies. To the extent that our personnel may have to spend time and resources to pursue or contest any matters that may be asserted from time to time in the future, this represents time and money that is not available for other actions that we might otherwise pursue which could be beneficial to our future. In addition, to the extent that we are unsuccessful in any legal proceedings, the consequences could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Our revenues depend on sale of products manufactured by third parties, which we cannot control. We rely on external third parties to manufacture certain of the products we sell. Currently, this risk is limited to a few Akorn and AVR products. However, we expect this risk to become more significant as we receive approvals for new products to be manufactured through our strategic partnerships and as we seek additional growth opportunities beyond the capacity and capabilities of our two domestic manufacturing facilities. If we are unable to obtain or retain third-party manufacturers for these products on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to distribute such products as planned. Further, no assurance can be given that the manufacturers we use will be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of our products to meet our needs or that the products supplied to us will meet our specifications. Any delays or difficulties with third-party manufacturers could adversely affect the marketing and distribution of certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Chairman of our Board of Directors is subject to conflicts of interest, and through his stock ownership and position as Chairman has substantial influence over our business strategies and policies. John N. Kapoor, Ph.D., the Chairman of our Board of Directors and a principal shareholder, is the President of EJ Financial Enterprises, Inc. (“EJ Financial”), a health care consulting investment company. EJ Financial is involved in the management of health care companies in various fields, and Dr. Kapoor is involved in various capacities with the management and operation of these companies. The John N. Kapoor Trust dated 9/20/89 (the “Kapoor Trust”), the beneficiary and sole trustee of which is Dr. Kapoor, is a principal shareholder of each of these companies. As a result, Dr. Kapoor does not devote his full time to our business. Although such companies do not currently compete directly with us, certain companies with which EJ Financial is involved are in the pharmaceutical business. Discoveries made by one or more of these companies could render our products less competitive or obsolete. Potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Dr. Kapoor owns, directly and indirectly, a substantial portion of our outstanding voting common stock. As a result, Dr. Kapoor can strongly influence, and potentially control, the outcome of our corporate actions, including the election of our directors and transactions involving a change of control. Decisions made by Dr. Kapoor with respect to his and his related parties’ ownership or trading of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and an adverse effect on our business. 14 We depend on key executive officers and must continue to attract and retain key personnel in order to compete successfully. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key executive officers. The loss of one or more of our key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our performance depends, to a large extent, on the continued service of our key research and development personnel, other technical employees, managers and sales personnel and our ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, particularly for highly motivated and experienced research and development and other technical personnel. We are facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for such personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled personnel in the future, and the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, and on our results of operations and financial condition. The FDA may authorize sales of some prescription pharmaceuticals on a non-prescription basis, which would reduce the profitability of our prescription products. From time to time, the FDA elects to permit sales of some pharmaceuticals currently sold on a prescription basis, without a prescription. FDA approval of the sale of our products without a prescription would reduce demand for our competing prescription products and, accordingly, reduce our profits. Our industry is very competitive. Additionally, changes in technology could render our products obsolete. We face significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies, including major pharmaceutical companies with financial resources substantially greater than ours, in developing, acquiring, manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. The selling prices of pharmaceutical products typically decline as competition increases. Further, other products now in use, under development or acquired by other pharmaceutical companies, may be more effective or offered at lower prices than our current or future products. The industry is characterized by rapid technological change that may render our products obsolete, and competitors may develop their products more rapidly than we can. Competitors may also be able to complete the regulatory process sooner, and therefore, may begin to market their products in advance of ours. We believe that competition in sales of our products is based primarily on price, service and technical capabilities. There can be no assurance that: (i) we will be able to develop or acquire commercially attractive pharmaceutical products; (ii) additional competitors will not enter the market; (iii) our existing products will not be rendered obsolete by the introduction or switch to generic of competing products; or (iv) competition from other pharmaceutical companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by general economic conditions, a volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If equity and credit market conditions prove unfavorable, we may have difficulty obtaining desired debt or equity financing, or obtaining such financing may be more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. A prolonged or profound economic downturn could result in adverse changes to product reimbursement, pricing or sales levels, which would harm our operating results. There is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive difficult economic times, which would directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon development plans. There is also a possibility that our stock price may decline, due in part to the volatility of the stock market and general economic conditions. We may implement product recalls and could be exposed to significant product liability claims; we may have to pay significant amounts to those harmed and may suffer from adverse publicity as a result. The manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk that our products, or items within our products, may prove to be defective and cause a health risk. In that event, we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority. We have recalled products in the past and, based on this experience, believe that the occurrence of a recall could result in significant costs to us, potential disruptions in the supply of our products to our customers and adverse publicity, all of which could harm our ability to market our products. We were prompted to initiate one product recall of our Cyanide Antidote Kit during 2008, due to the third quarter recall notification by BD, of their 60ml syringe. This syringe is included as part of a packaged kit along with drug components manufactured and sourced by us, to support the Cyanide Antidote Kit. Our recall of the Cyanide Antidote Kit was necessitated by the BD recall, and has resulted in no patient impact and no shortage of product supply to the marketplace. Our supporting efforts were reviewed by the FDA, as part of our due diligence in apprising the FDA of our reaction to the BD recall. There were no product recalls in 2011, 2010 or 2009. 15 Although we are not currently subject to any material product liability proceedings, we may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future. Even meritless claims could subject us to adverse publicity, hinder us from securing insurance coverage in the future and require us to incur significant legal fees and divert the attention of the key employees from running our business. Successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We currently have product liability insurance in the amount of $10,000,000 for aggregate annual claims with a $100,000 deductible per incident and a $500,000 aggregate annual deductible. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to fully cover potential claims. Additionally, there can be no assurance that adequate insurance coverage will be available in the future at acceptable costs, if at all, or that a product liability claim would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source. We require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and for third parties with which we have contracted. Many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source and interruptions in the supply of these raw materials and components could disrupt our manufacturing of specific products and cause our sales and profitability to decline. Further, in the case of many of our ANDAs and NDAs, only one supplier of raw materials has been identified. Because FDA approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications, FDA approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier. The qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts. If for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products, we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our patents and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and processes. The patent and proprietary rights position of competitors in the pharmaceutical industry generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and is the subject of much litigation. There can be no assurance that any patent applications or other proprietary rights, including licensed rights, relating to our potential products or processes will result in patents being issued or other proprietary rights secured, or that the resulting patents or proprietary rights, if any, will provide protection against competitors who: (i) successfully challenge our patents or proprietary rights; (ii) obtain patents or proprietary rights that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business; or (iii) are able to circumvent our patent or proprietary rights position. It is possible that other parties have conducted or are conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that would precede any discoveries made by us, which could prevent us from obtaining patent or other protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed there from. Consequently, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to or rendering obsolete those that we are planning to develop, or duplicate any of our products. Our inability to obtain patents for, or other proprietary rights in, our products and processes or the ability of competitors to circumvent or obsolete our patents or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, virtually all the drug products that we market are generics, with essentially no patent or proprietary rights attached. While this fact allowed us the opportunity to develop or to purchase and obtain FDA approval to market our generic products, it also allows competing drug companies to do the same. Should multiple additional drug companies choose to develop and market the same generic products that we actively market, our profit margins could decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Concentrated ownership of our common stock and our registration of shares for public sale creates a risk of sudden changes in our share price. The sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder’s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. We have registered shares held by certain of our investors for sale under registration statements filed with the SEC. Sales of these shares on the open market could cause the price of our stock to decline. 16 Exercise of warrants and options, or issuance of shares pursuant to our convertible debt, may have a substantial dilutive effect on our common stock. If the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise or conversion of any warrants or stock options is in excess of the various exercise or conversion prices of such convertible securities, exercise or conversion of such convertible securities would have a dilutive effect on our common stock. As of December 31, 2011, holders of our outstanding warrants and options would receive 16,591,751 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $2.13 per share. Any additional financing that we secure likely will require the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock which may result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders. Our earnings will be diluted if the average closing price of our common stock exceeds the Conversion Price (currently $8.76 per share) on our convertible Notes. In addition, the Notes become convertible if the closing trading price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the Conversion Price for 20 of the last 30 trading days of any calendar quarter through the remaining term of the Notes. If the Notes become convertible and are surrendered for conversion, we have the option of satisfying all or a portion of our obligation in shares of our common stock, which could result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders. We may issue preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock. We are authorized to issue up to a total of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may determine whether to issue additional shares of preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock without further action by holders of our common stock. If we issue additional shares of preferred stock, it could affect the rights or reduce the value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. These terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions. We continue to seek capital for the growth of our business, and this additional capital may be raised through the issuance of additional preferred stock. We experience significant quarterly fluctuation of our results of operations, which may increase the volatility of our stock price. Our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the timing of the development and marketing of new pharmaceutical products, the failure to develop such products, delays in obtaining government approvals, including FDA approval of NDAs or ANDAs for our products, expenditures to comply with governmental requirements for manufacturing facilities, expenditures incurred to acquire and promote pharmaceutical products, changes in our customer base, a customer’s termination of a substantial account, the availability and cost of raw materials, interruptions in supply by third-party manufacturers, seasonal or cyclical fluctuations in the sales of certain of our products, the introduction of new products or technological innovations by our competitors, loss of key personnel, changes in the mix of products sold by us, changes in sales and marketing expenditures, competitive pricing pressures, expenditures incurred to pursue or contest pending or threatened legal action and our ability to meet our financial covenants. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in avoiding losses in any future period. Such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock. The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract management. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). These requirements are extensive. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight is required. This may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Item 1B.
