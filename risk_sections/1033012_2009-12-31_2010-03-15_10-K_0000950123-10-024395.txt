ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These risk factors include the following: Market, Interest Rate and Liquidity Risk Our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally. The financial services industry has recently been materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a significant and prolonged period of negative economic conditions. This was initially triggered by declines in the values of subprime mortgages, but spread to virtually all mortgage and real estate asset classes, to leveraged bank loans and to nearly all asset classes. The U.S. economy has continued to be adversely affected by these events as shown by increased unemployment across most industries, increased delinquencies and defaults on loans. There is also evidence of strategic defaults on loans, which are characterized by borrowers that appear to have the financial means to satisfy the required mortgage payments as they come due but choose not to do so because the value of the assets securing their debts (such as the value of a house securing a residential mortgage) may have declined below the amount of the debt itself. Further, there are several states, such as California, in which many residential mortgages are 33 Table of Contents effectively non-recourse in nature or in which statutes or regulations cause collection efforts to be unduly difficult or expensive to pursue. There are also a multitude of commercial real estate loans throughout the United States that mature in 2010 and 2011, and declines in commercial real estate values nationwide could prevent refinancing of the debt and thereby result in an increase in delinquencies, foreclosures and nonperforming loans, as well as further reductions in asset values. The decline in asset values to date has resulted in considerable losses to secured lenders, such as the Bank, that historically have been able to rely on the underlying collateral value of their loans to be minimize or eliminate losses. There can be no assurance that property values will stabilize or improve and if they continue to decline, there can be no assurance that the Bank will not continue to incur significant credit losses. Market conditions have also led to the failure or merger of a number of the largest financial institutions in the U.S. and global marketplaces. Financial institution failures or near-failures have resulted in further losses as a consequence of defaults on securities issued by them and defaults under bilateral derivatives and other contracts entered into with such entities as counterparties. Furthermore, declining asset values, defaults on mortgages and consumer loans, and the lack of market and investor confidence, as well as other factors, have all combined to increase credit default swap spreads, to cause rating agencies to lower credit ratings, and to otherwise increase the cost and decrease the availability of liquidity, despite very significant declines in central bank borrowing rates and other government actions. Banks and other lenders have suffered significant losses and often have become reluctant to lend, even on a secured basis, due to the increased risk of default and the impact of declining asset values on the value of collateral. In response to market conditions, governments, regulators and central banks in the United States and worldwide took numerous steps to increase liquidity and to restore investor confidence but asset values have continued to decline and access to liquidity, remains very limited. Overall, during fiscal 2009 and for the foreseeable future, the business environment has been extremely adverse for our business and there can be no assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term. Until they do, we expect our results of operations to be adversely affected. Defaults by another larger financial institution could adversely affect financial markets generally. The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit or other relationships between and among institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as banks with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect us. We may be required to raise capital at terms that are materially adverse to our stockholders. We suffered losses in excess of $513.0 million and $275.0 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively, and as a result, our stockholders equity and regulatory capital declined. During 2008, 2009 and early 2010, we raised capital at terms that were significantly dilutive to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer additional losses or that additional capital will not otherwise be required for regulatory or other reasons. In those circumstances, we may be required to obtain additional capital to maintain our regulatory capital ratios at the highest, or well capitalized, level. Such capital raising could be at terms that are dilutive to existing stockholders and there can be no assurance that any capital raising we undertake would be successful given the current level of disruption in financial markets. If we cannot effectively manage the impact of the volatility of interest rates our earnings could be adversely affected. Our main objective in managing interest rate risk is to maximize the benefit and minimize the adverse effect of changes in interest rates on our earnings over an extended period of time. In managing these risks, we look at, among other things, yield curves and hedging strategies. As such, our interest rate risk management strategies may result in significant earnings volatility in the short term because the market value 34 Table of Contents of our assets and related hedges may be significantly impacted either positively or negatively by unanticipated variations in interest rates. In particular, our portfolio of mortgage servicing rights and our mortgage banking pipeline are highly sensitive to movements in interest rates. Our profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest margin, which is the difference between the rates we receive on loans made to others and investments and the rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funds. Our profitability also depends in substantial part on the volume of loan originations and the related fees received from our mortgage banking operations. Our net interest margin and our volume of mortgage originations will depend on many factors that are partly or entirely outside our control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies, and economic conditions generally. Historically, net interest margin and the mortgage origination volumes for the Bank and for other financial institutions have widened and narrowed in response to these and other factors. Also, our volume of mortgage originations will also depend on the mortgage qualification standards imposed by the Agencies such that if their standards are tightened, our origination volume could be reduced. Our goal has been to structure our asset and liability management strategies to maximize the benefit of changes in market interest rates on our net interest margin and revenues related to mortgage origination volume. However, we cannot give any assurance that a sudden or significant change in prevailing interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results. There exists a natural counterbalance of our loan production and servicing operations. Increasing long-term interest rates may decrease our mortgage loan originations and sales. Generally, the volume of mortgage loan originations is inversely related to the level of long-term interest rates which is directly related to the value of our servicing operations. During periods of low long-term interest rates, a significant number of our customers may elect to refinance their mortgages (i.e., pay off their existing higher rate mortgage loans with new mortgage loans obtained at lower interest rates). Our profitability levels and those of others in the mortgage banking industry have generally been strongest during periods of low and/or declining interest rates, as we have historically been able to sell the resulting increased volume of loans into the secondary market at a gain. We have also benefited from periods of wide spreads between short and long term interest rates. During much of 2009, the interest rate environment was quite favorable for mortgage loan originations and sales, in large part due to government intervention through the purchase of mortgage-backed securities that facilitated a low-rate interest rate environment for the residential mortgage market. In addition, there were wide spreads between short and long term interest rates for much of 2009, resulting in higher profit margins on loan sales than in prior periods. There can be no assurance that these conditions will continue and a change in these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. When interest rates fluctuate, repricing risks arise from the timing difference in the maturity and/or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions. While such repricing mismatches are fundamental to our business, they can expose us to fluctuations in income and economic value as interest rates vary. Our interest rate risk management strategies do not completely eliminate repricing risk. A significant amount of our depositors are believed to be rate sensitive. Because of the interest rate sensitivity of these depositors, there is no guarantee that in a changing interest rate environment we will be able to retain all funds in these accounts. If we do not meet the NYSE continued listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted. On September 15, 2009, we were notified by the NYSE that we did not satisfy one of the NYSEs standards for continued listing applicable to our common stock. The NYSE noted specifically that we were below criteria for the NYSEs price criteria for common stock because the average closing price of our common stock was less than $1.00 per share over a consecutive 30-trading-day period. The NYSEs price criteria standard requires that any listed security trade at a minimum average closing share price of $1.00 during any consecutive 30-trading-day period. Under the NYSEs rules, in order to cure the deficiency for this continued listing standard, our common stock share price and the average share price over a consecutive 30-trading-day period both must exceed $1.00 within six months following receipt of the non-compliance notice. The delisting of our common stock may significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our shares and negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. The delisting may have other negative 35 Table of Contents results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees and the loss of institutional investor interest in our common stock and our ability to execute on our business plan. However, we have responded to the NYSE with notice of our intent to cure the current deficiency, in which we noted that we will consider a reverse stock split promptly following our next annual meeting of stockholders that will enable us to be in compliance with the price requirement. During the cure period and subject to compliance with NYSEs other continued listing standards, we believe that our common stock will continue to be listed on the NYSE. Current and further deterioration in the housing market, as well as the number of programs that have been introduced to address the situation by government agencies and government sponsored enterprises, may lead to increased costs to service loans which could affect our margins or impair the value of our mortgage servicing rights. The housing and the residential mortgage markets have experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions. In response, federal and state government, as well as the U.S. government sponsored enterprises, have developed a number of programs and instituted a number of requirements on servicers in an effort to limit foreclosures and, in the case of the U.S. government sponsored enterprises, to minimize losses on loans that they guarantee or own. These additional programs and requirements may increase operating expenses or otherwise change the costs associated with servicing loans for others, which may result in lower margins or an impairment in the expected value of our mortgage servicing rights. Current and further deterioration in the housing and commercial real estate markets may lead to increased loss severities and further increases in delinquencies and non-performing assets in our loan portfolios. Consequently, our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our reserves. Approximately 85.7% of our loans held for investment portfolio as of December 31, 2009, was comprised of loans collateralized by real estate in which we were in the first lien position. A significant source of risk arises from the possibility that we could sustain losses because borrowers, guarantors, and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. The underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we have adopted to address this risk may not prevent unexpected losses that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Unexpected losses may arise from a wide variety of specific or systemic factors, many of which are beyond our ability to predict, influence or control. As with most lending institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable and inherent losses in our loans held for our investment portfolio. Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. The allowance for loan losses reflects our estimate of the probable and inherent losses in our portfolio of loans at the relevant statement of financial condition date. Our allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio, composition and growth of the portfolio and economic factors. The determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond our control and these losses may exceed current estimates. Moreover, our regulators may require revisions to our allowance for loan losses, which may have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition. Recently, the housing and the residential mortgage markets have experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions. If market conditions continue to deteriorate, they may lead to additional valuation adjustments on our loan portfolios and real estate owned as we continue to reassess the market value of our loan portfolio, the loss severities of loans in default, and the net realizable value of real estate owned. 36 Table of Contents Changes in the fair value or ratings downgrades of our securities may reduce our stockholders equity, net earnings, or regulatory capital ratios. At December 31, 2009, $0.6 billion of our securities were classified as available-for-sale. The estimated fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio may increase or decrease depending on market conditions. Our securities portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate securities. We increase or decrease stockholders equity by the amount of the change in the unrealized gain or loss (difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost) of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, net of the related tax benefit, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders equity, as well as book value per common share and tangible book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. In the case of debt securities, if these securities are never sold, the decrease may be recovered over the life of the securities. We conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other-than-temporary. Factors which we consider in our analysis include, but are not limited to, the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the security, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, whether the decline appears to be related to issuer conditions or general market or industry conditions, our intent and ability to retain the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value and the likelihood of any near-term fair value recovery. We generally view changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary, which is consistent with our experience. If we deem such decline to be other-than-temporary related to credit losses, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings as a component of non-interest income. We have, in the past, recorded other than temporary impairment (OTTI) charges. We continue to monitor our securities portfolio as part of our ongoing OTTI evaluation process. No assurance can be given that we will not need to recognize OTTI charges related to securities in the future. The capital that we are required to hold for regulatory purposes is impacted by, among other things, the securities ratings. Therefore, ratings downgrades on our securities may have a material adverse effect on our risk-based regulatory capital. Certain hedging strategies that we use to manage our investment in mortgage servicing rights may be ineffective to offset any adverse changes in the fair value of these assets due to changes in interest rates and market liquidity. We invest in MSRs to support our mortgage banking strategies and to deploy capital at acceptable returns. The value of these assets and the income they provide tend to be counter-cyclical to the changes in production volumes and gain on sale of loans that result from changes in interest rates. We also enter into derivatives to hedge our MSRs to offset changes in fair value resulting from the actual or anticipated changes in prepayments and changing interest rate environments. The primary risk associated with MSRs is that they will lose a substantial portion of their value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments occasioned by declining interest rates. Conversely, these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than anticipated. Our hedging strategies are highly susceptible to prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, among other factors. In addition, our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds, we may incur losses that would adversely impact our earnings. Our ability to borrow funds, maintain or increase deposits or raise capital could be limited, which could adversely affect our liquidity and earnings. Our access to external sources of financing, including deposits, as well as the cost of that financing, is dependent on various factors including regulatory restrictions. Many of these factors depend upon market 37 Table of Contents perceptions of events that are beyond our control, such as the failure of other banks or financial institutions. Other factors are dependent upon our results of operations, including but not limited to material changes in operating margins; earnings trends and volatility; funding and liquidity management practices; financial leverage on an absolute basis or relative to peers; the composition of the consolidated statement of financial condition and/or capital structure; geographic and business diversification; and our market share and competitive position in the business segments in which we operate. The material deterioration in any one or a combination of these factors could result in a downgrade of our credit or servicer ratings or a decline in our financial reputation within the marketplace and could result in our having a limited ability to borrow funds, maintain or increase deposits (including custodial deposits for our agency servicing portfolio) or to raise capital. Our ability to make mortgage loans and to fund our investments and operations depends largely on our ability to secure funds on terms acceptable to us. Our primary sources of funds to meet our financing needs include loan sales and securitizations; deposits, which include custodial accounts from our servicing portfolio and brokered deposits and public funds; borrowings from the FHLBI or other federally backed entities; borrowings from investment and commercial banks through repurchase agreements; and capital-raising activities. If we are unable to maintain any of these financing arrangements, are restricted from accessing certain of these funding sources by our regulators, are unable to arrange for new financing on terms acceptable to us, or if we default on any of the covenants imposed upon us by our borrowing facilities, then we may have to reduce the number of loans we are able to originate for sale in the secondary market or for our own investment or take other actions that could have other negative effects on our operations. A sudden and significant reduction in loan originations that occurs as a result could adversely impact our earnings. There is no guarantee that we will able to renew or maintain our financing arrangements or deposits or that we will be able to adequately access capital markets when or if a need for additional capital arises. Regulatory Risk Our business is highly regulated and subject to change. The banking industry is extensively regulated at the federal and state levels. Insured depository institutions and their holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by financial regulatory authorities covering all aspects of their organization, management and operations. The OTS is the primary regulator of the Bank and its affiliated entities. In addition to its regulatory powers, the OTS also has significant enforcement authority that it can use to address banking practices that it believes to be unsafe and unsound, violations of laws, and capital and operational deficiencies. The FDIC also has significant regulatory authority over the Bank and may impose further regulation at its discretion for the protection of the DIF. Such regulation and supervision are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and for our depositors and borrowers, and are not intended to protect the interests of investors in our common stock. Further, the Banks business is affected by consumer protection laws and regulation at the state and federal level, including a variety of consumer protection provisions, many of which provide for a private right of action and pose a risk of class action lawsuits. In the current environment, it is likely that there will be significant changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regime in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services industry, and it is not possible to predict the impact of such changes on our results of operations. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, changes in the interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, are continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations, and/or the implementation of new government programs and plans could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Among other things, such changes, as well as the implementation of such changes, could subject us to additional costs, constrain our resources, limit the types of financial services and products that we may offer, increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, and/or reduce our ability to effectively hedge against risk. See further information in Item 1. Business  Regulation and Supervision. 38 Table of Contents We are subject to the restrictions and conditions of supervisory agreements with the OTS. Failure to comply with the supervisory agreements could result in further enforcement action against us. The Bank and we entered into Supervisory Agreements with the OTS on January 27, 2010, which require that the Bank and we separately take the actions set forth in Item 1. Business  Regulation and Supervision  Supervisory Agreements. While we believe that we have taken numerous steps to comply with, and intend to comply in the future with, all of the requirements of the Supervisory Agreements, if we fail to comply with the Supervisory Agreements, the OTS could initiate further enforcement action, including the imposition of further operating restrictions and result in additional enforcement actions against us. Such actions, if initiated, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity. Increases in deposit insurance premiums and special FDIC assessments will adversely affect our earnings. Beginning in late 2008 and continuing in 2009, the economic environment caused higher levels of bank failures, which dramatically increased FDIC resolution costs and led to a significant reduction in the deposit insurance fund. As a result, the FDIC has significantly increased the initial base assessment rates paid by financial institutions for deposit insurance. The base assessment rate was increased by seven basis points (seven cents for every $100 of deposits) for the first quarter of 2009. Effective April 1, 2009, initial base assessment rates were changed to range from 12 basis points to 45 basis points across all risk categories with possible adjustments to these rates based on certain debt-related components. These increases in the base assessment rate have increased our deposit insurance costs and negatively impacted our earnings. In addition, in May 2009, the FDIC imposed a special assessment on all insured institutions due to recent bank and savings association failures. The emergency assessment amounted to five basis points on each institutions assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009, subject to a maximum equal to 10 basis points times the institutions assessment base. The FDIC assessment is also based on risk categories, with the assessment rate increasing as the risk the financial institution poses to the DIF increases. Any increases resulting from our movement within the risk categories could increase our deposit insurance costs and negatively impacted our earnings. In addition, the FDIC may impose additional emergency special assessments which will adversely affect our earnings. We are subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny with respect to bank secrecy and anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. In recent years, regulators have intensified their focus on the USA PATRIOT Acts anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance requirements. There is also increased scrutiny of our compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. In order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, we have been required to revise policies and procedures and to install new systems. We cannot be certain that the policies, procedures and systems we have in place are flawless. Therefore, there is no assurance that in every instance we are in full compliance with these requirements. Future dividend payments and common stock repurchases may be restricted. Under the terms of the TARP, for so long as any preferred stock issued under the TARP remains outstanding, we are prohibited from increasing dividends on our common stock, and from making certain repurchases of equity securities, including our common stock, without the Treasurys consent until the third anniversary of the Treasurys investment or until the Treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock it purchased under the TARP to third parties. Furthermore, as long as the preferred stock issued to the Treasury is outstanding, dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities, including our common stock, are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. In addition, our ability to make dividend payments is subject to statutory restrictions and to the limitations set forth in the Supervisory Agreements. Also, under Michigan law, we are prohibited from paying dividends on our capital stock if, after giving effect to the dividend, (i) we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or (ii) our total assets would be less than the sum of our total 39 Table of Contents liabilities plus the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders with preferential rights on dissolution which are superior to those receiving the dividend. Operational Risk We depend on our institutional counterparties to provide services that are critical to our business. If one or more of our institutional counterparties defaults on its obligations to us or becomes insolvent, it could have a material adverse affect on our earnings, liquidity, capital position and financial condition. We face the risk that one or more of our institutional counterparties may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. Our primary exposures to institutional counterparty risk are with third-party providers of credit enhancement on the mortgage assets that we hold in our investment portfolio, including mortgage insurers and financial guarantors, issuers of securities held on our consolidated statement of financial condition, and derivatives counterparties. Counterparty risk can also adversely affect our ability to sell mortgage servicing rights in the future. The challenging mortgage and credit market conditions have adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, the liquidity and financial condition of a number of our institutional counterparties, particularly those whose businesses are concentrated in the mortgage industry. One or more of these institutions may default in its obligations to us for a number of reasons, such as changes in financial condition that affect their credit ratings, a reduction in liquidity, operational failures or insolvency. Several of our institutional counterparties have experienced ratings downgrades and liquidity constraints. These and other key institutional counterparties may become subject to serious liquidity problems that, either temporarily or permanently, negatively affect the viability of their business plans or reduce their access to funding sources. The financial difficulties that a number of our institutional counterparties are currently experiencing may negatively affect the ability of these counterparties to meet their obligations to us and the amount or quality of the products or services they provide to us. A default by a counterparty with significant obligations to us could result in significant financial losses to us and could have a material adverse affect our ability to conduct our operations, which would adversely affect our earnings, liquidity, capital position and financial condition. In addition, a default by a counterparty may require us to obtain a substitute counterparty which may not exist in this economic climate and which may, as a result, cause us to default on our related financial obligations. We use estimates in determining the fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation. A portion of our assets are carried on our consolidated statement of financial condition at fair value, including our MSRs, certain mortgage loans held for sale, trading assets, available-for-sale securities, and derivatives. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices or internal valuation models that utilize observable market data inputs to estimate their fair value. In certain cases, observable market prices and data may not be readily available or their availability may be diminished due to market conditions. We use financial models to value certain of these assets. These models are complex and use asset specific collateral data and market inputs for interest rates. We cannot assure you that the models or the underlying assumptions will prove to be predictive and remain so over time, and therefore, actual results may differ from our models. Any assumptions we use are complex as we must make judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and actual experience may differ from our assumptions. Different assumptions could result in significant declines in valuation, which in turn could result in significant declines in the dollar amount of assets we report on our consolidated statement of financial condition. Our HELOC funding reimbursements have been negatively impacted by loan losses. Two of our securitizations involving HELOCs have experienced more losses than originally expected. As a result, the note insurer relating thereto determined that the status of such securitizations should be changed to rapid amortization. Accordingly, we are no longer being reimbursed by the issuers of those securitizations for draws that we are required to fund under the HELOC loan documentation until after the issuer expenses and noteholders are paid in full (of which an aggregate $43.1 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2009) and the note insurer is reimbursed for any amounts owed. Consequently, this status change may result in 40 Table of Contents us not receiving reimbursement for all funds that we have advanced to date or that we may be required to advance in the future. As of December 31, 2009, we had advanced a total of $78.4 million of funds under these arrangements, which we refer to as transferors interests. Our potential future funding obligations are dependent upon a number of factors specified in our HELOC loan agreements, which obligations as of December 31, 2009 are $37.0 million after excluding unfunded commitment amounts that have been frozen or suspended by us pursuant to the terms of such loan agreements. We continually monitor the credit quality of the borrower to ensure that they meet their original obligations under their HELOCs, including with respect to the collateral value. During the fourth quarter 2009, we determined that the transferors interests had deteriorated to the extent that, under accounting guidance ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, a liability was required to be recorded. During the period, we recorded a liability of $7.6 million to reflect the expected liability arising from losses on future draws associated with this securitization, of which $7.3 million remained at December 31, 2009. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer additional losses on the transferors interests or that additional liabilities will not be recorded. Our secondary market reserve for losses could be insufficient. We currently maintain a secondary market reserve, which is a liability on our consolidated statement of financial condition, to reflect our best estimate of expected losses that we have incurred on loans that we have sold or securitized into the secondary market and must subsequently repurchase or with respect to which we must indemnify the purchasers because of violations of customary representations and warranties. Increases to this reserve for current loan sales reduce our net gain on loan sales, with adjustments to our previous estimates recorded as an increase or decrease to our other fees and charges. The level of the reserve reflects managements continuing evaluation of loss experience on repurchased loans, indemnifications, and present economic conditions, among other things. The determination of the appropriate level of the secondary market reserve inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of repurchase risks and expected losses. Both the assumptions and estimates used could be inaccurate, resulting in a level of reserve that is less than actual losses. If additional reserves are required, it could have an adverse effect on our consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations. Our home lending profitability could be significantly reduced if we are not able to resell mortgages. Currently, we sell a substantial portion of the mortgage loans we originate. The profitability of our mortgage banking operations depends in large part upon our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and to sell them in the secondary market at a gain. Thus, we are dependent upon (1) the existence of an active secondary market and (2) our ability to profitably sell loans or securities into that market. Our ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by the Agencies and other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Some of the largest participants in the secondary market, including the Agencies, are government-sponsored enterprises whose activities are governed by federal law. Any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of such government-sponsored enterprises could, in turn, adversely effect our operations. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. government. Although to date, the conservatorship has not had a significant or adverse effect on our operations, it is currently unclear whether further changes would significantly and adversely affect our operations. In addition, our ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon our ability to remain eligible for the programs offered by the Agencies and other institutional and non-institutional investors. Our ability to remain eligible may also depend on having an acceptable peer-relative delinquency ratio for Federal Housing Authority (FHA) and maintaining a delinquency rate with respect to Ginnie Mae pools that are below Ginnie Mae guidelines. In the case of Ginnie Mae pools, the Bank has repurchased delinquent loans to maintain compliance with the minimum required delinquency ratios. Although these loans are typically insured as to principal by FHA, such repurchases increase our capital and liquidity needs, and there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital or liquidity to continue to purchase such loans out of the Ginnie Mae pools. 41 Table of Contents Any significant impairment of our eligibility with any of the Agencies could materially and adversely affect our operations. Further, the criteria for loans to be accepted under such programs may be changed from time-to-time by the sponsoring entity which could result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations. The profitability of participating in specific programs may vary depending on a number of factors, including our administrative costs of originating and purchasing qualifying loans and our costs of meeting such criteria. Our holding company is dependent on the Bank for funding of obligations and dividends. As a holding company without significant assets other than the capital stock of the Bank, our ability to service our debt or preferred stock obligations, including payment of interest on debentures issued as part of capital raising activities using trust preferred securities and payment of dividends on the preferred stock we issued to the Treasury, is dependent upon available cash on hand and the receipt of dividends from the Bank on such capital stock. The declaration of dividends by the Bank on all classes of its capital stock is subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the Bank and to applicable regulatory limitations, including prior approval of the OTS under its Supervisory Agreement with the OTS. If the earnings of our subsidiaries are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, we may not be able to service our debt or our preferred stock obligations. Furthermore, the OTS has the authority, and under certain circumstances the duty, to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the holding companies they supervise, including us. See Item 1. Business  Regulation and Supervision  Payment of Dividends. We may be exposed to other operational and reputational risks. We are exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees, customers or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in activities, such as lending practices, data security, corporate governance, and may damage our reputation. Additionally, actions taken by government regulators and community organizations may also damage our reputation. This negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Our dependence upon automated systems to record and process our transaction volume poses the risk that technical system flaws, poor implementation of systems or employee errors or tampering or manipulation of those systems could result in losses and may be difficult to detect. We may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are beyond our control (for example, computer viruses, electrical or telecommunications outages). We are further exposed to the risk that our third party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors as we are). These disruptions may interfere with service to our customers and result in a financial loss or liability. General Risk Factors We have many new members of our executive team. A significant number of our executive officers, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, have been employed by us for a relatively short period of time. In addition, several of our non-employee directors have been appointed to the board of directors since the beginning of 2009. Since joining us, the newly constituted management team has devoted substantial efforts to significantly change our business strategy and operational activities. There is no assurance that these efforts will prove successful or that the management team will be able to successfully execute upon the revised business strategy and operational activities. The potential loss of key members of senior management or the inability to attract and retain qualified relationship managers in the future could affect our ability to operate effectively. We depend on the services of existing senior management to carry out our business and investment strategies. As we expand and as we continue to refine and reshape our business model, we will need to continue to attract and retain additional senior management and to recruit qualified individuals to succeed 42 Table of Contents existing key personnel that leave our employ. In addition, as we continue to grow our business and plan to continue to expand our locations, products and services, we will need to continue to attract and retain qualified banking personnel. Competition for such personnel is especially keen in our geographic market areas and competition for the best people in most businesses in which we engage can be intense. In addition, as a TARP recipient, the ARRA limits the amount of incentive compensation that can be paid to certain executives. The effect could be to limit our ability to attract and retain senior management in the future. If we are unable to attract and retain talented people, our business could suffer. The loss of the services of any senior management personnel, and, in particular, the loss for any reason, including death or disability of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The network and computer systems on which we depend could fail or experience a security breach. Our computer systems could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Because we conduct part of our business over the Internet and outsource several critical functions to third parties, operations will depend on the ability, as well as that of third-party service providers, to protect computer systems and network infrastructure against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, physical break-ins or similar catastrophic events. Any damage or failure that causes interruptions in operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a significant barrier to online financial transactions is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Our Internet banking system relies on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms our third-party service providers use to protect customer transaction data. If any such compromise of security were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Market acceptance of Internet banking depends substantially on widespread adoption of the Internet for general commercial and financial services transactions. If another provider of commercial services through the Internet were to suffer damage from physical break-in, security breach or other disruptive problems caused by the Internet or other users, the growth and public acceptance of the Internet for commercial transactions could suffer. This type of event could deter our potential customers or cause customers to leave us and thereby materially and adversely effect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our loans are geographically concentrated in only a few states. A significant portion of our mortgage loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in certain states, including California, Michigan, Florida, Washington, Colorado, Texas and Arizona, which collectively represent approximately 68.7% of our mortgage loans held for investment balance at December 31, 2009. In addition, 52.9% of our commercial real estate loans are in Michigan. Continued adverse economic conditions in these few markets could cause delinquencies and charge-offs of these loans to increase, likely resulting in a corresponding and disproportionately large decline in revenues and an increase in credit risk. We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential 43 Table of Contents environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. General business, economic and political conditions may significantly affect our earnings. Our business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, recession, unemployment, real estate values, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, and the strength of the U.S. economy, as well as the local economies in which we conduct business. If any of these conditions worsen, our business and earnings could be adversely affected. For example, business and economic conditions that negatively impact household incomes could decrease the demand for our home loans and increase the number of customers who become delinquent or default on their loans; or, a rising interest rate environment could decrease the demand for loans. In addition, our business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, and the perception of those policies by the financial markets. The Federal Reserves policies influence both the financial markets and the size and liquidity of the mortgage origination market, which significantly impacts the earnings of our mortgage lending operation and the value of our investment in MSRs and other retained interests. The Federal Reserves policies and perceptions of those policies also influence the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in those policies or perceptions are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are a controlled company that is exempt from certain NYSE corporate governance requirements. Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. The NYSE generally requires a majority of directors to be independent and requires audit, compensation and nominating committees to be composed solely of independent directors. However, under the rules applicable to the NYSE, if another company owns more than 50% of the voting power of a listed company, that company is considered a controlled company and exempt from rules relating to independence of the board of directors and the compensation and nominating committees. We are a controlled company because MP Thrift beneficially owns more than 50% of our outstanding voting stock. A majority of the directors on the compensation and nominating committees are affiliated with MP Thrift. While a majority of our directors are currently independent, MP Thrift has the right, if exercised, to designate a majority of the directors on the board of directors. Our stockholders do not have, and may never have, all the protections that these rules are intended to provide. If we become unable to continue to be deemed a controlled company, we would be required to meet these independence requirements and, if we are not able to do so, our common stock could be delisted from the NYSE. Our controlling stockholder has significant influence over us, including control over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, whether or not such decisions are in the best interests of other stockholders. MP Thrift beneficially owns a substantial majority of our outstanding common stock and as a result, has control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and also the ability to prevent any transaction 44 Table of Contents that requires the approval of our board of directors or the stockholders regardless of whether or not other members of our board of directors or stockholders believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. So long as MP Thrift continues to hold a majority of our outstanding common stock, it will have the ability to control the vote in any election of directors and other matters being voted on, and continue to exert significant influence over us. Other Risk Factors. The above description of risk factors is not exhaustive. Other risk factors are described elsewhere herein as well as in other reports and documents that we file with or furnish to the SEC. Other factors that could also cause results to differ from our expectations may not be described in any such report or document. Each of these factors could by itself, or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. ITEM 1B.
