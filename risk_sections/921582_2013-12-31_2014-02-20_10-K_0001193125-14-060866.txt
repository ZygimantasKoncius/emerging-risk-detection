Item 1A. Risk Factors If any of the risks described below occurs, the Companys business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The risks described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks not presently known to the Company or that it deems immaterial, may also impair its business or operations. The Company depends principally on commercial movie exhibitors to purchase or lease IMAX theater systems, to supply box-office revenue under joint revenue sharing arrangements and under its sales and sales-type lease agreements and to supply venues in which to exhibit IMAX DMR films and the Company can make no assurances that exhibitors will continue to do any of these things. The Companys primary customers are commercial multiplex exhibitors, whose systems represent 95.3% of the 407 systems in the Companys backlog as at December 31, 2013. The Company is unable to predict if, or when, they or other exhibitors will purchase or lease IMAX theater systems or enter into joint revenue sharing arrangements with the Company, or whether any of the Companys existing customers will continue to do any of the foregoing. If exhibitors choose to reduce their levels of expansion or decide not to purchase or lease IMAX theater systems or enter into joint revenue sharing arrangements with the Company, the Companys revenues would not increase at an anticipated rate and motion picture studios may be less willing to convert their films into the Companys format for exhibition in commercial IMAX theaters. As a result, the Companys future revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected. The success of the IMAX theater network is directly related to the availability and success of IMAX DMR films for which there can be no guarantee. An important factor affecting the growth and success of the IMAX theater network is the availability of films for IMAX theaters and the box-office performance of such films. The Company itself produces only a small number of such films and, as a result, the Company relies principally on films produced by third party filmmakers and studios, both Hollywood and local language features converted into the Companys large format using the Companys IMAX DMR technology. In 2013, 38 IMAX DMR films were released by studios to the worldwide IMAX theater network. There is no guarantee that filmmakers and studios will continue to release films to the IMAX theater network, or that the films they produce will be commercially successful. The steady flow and successful box-office performance of IMAX DMR releases have become increasingly important to the Companys financial performance as the number of joint revenue sharing arrangements included in the overall IMAX network has grown considerably. The Company is increasingly directly impacted by box-office results for the films released to the IMAX network through its joint revenue sharing arrangements as well as through the percentage of the box-office receipts the Company receives from the studios releasing IMAX DMR films, and the Companys continued ability to find suitable partners for joint revenue share arrangements and to sell IMAX theater systems also depends on the number and commercial success of films released to its network. The commercial success of films released to IMAX theaters depends on a number of factors outside of the Companys control, including whether the film receives critical acclaim, the timing of its release, the success of the marketing efforts of the studio releasing the film and consumer preferences. Moreover, films can be subject to delays in production or changes in release schedule, which can negatively impact the number, timing and quality of IMAX DMR and IMAX original films released to the IMAX theater network. The introduction of new, competing products and technologies could harm the Companys business. The out-of-home entertainment industry is very competitive, and the Company faces a number of competitive challenges. According to the National Association of Theater Owners, as at December 31, 2013, there were approximately 16,277 conventional-sized screens in North American multiplexes equipped with digital 3D systems. In addition, some commercial exhibitors have introduced their own branded, large-screen 3D auditoriums and in many cases have marketed those auditoriums as having the same quality or attributes as an IMAX theater. The Company also may face competition in the future from companies in the entertainment industry with new technologies and/or substantially greater capital resources to develop and support them. If the Company is unable to continue to deliver a premium movie-going experience, or if other technologies surpass those of the Company, the Company may be unable to continue to produce theater systems which are premium to, or differentiated from, other theater systems. If the Company is unable to produce a differentiated theater experience, consumers may be unwilling to pay the price premiums associated with the cost of IMAX theater tickets and box-office performance of IMAX films may decline. Declining box-office performance of IMAX films would materially and adversely harm the Companys business and prospects. The Company also faces in-home competition from a number of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as home video, pay-per-view, video-on-demand, DVD, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television. The Company further competes for the publics leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including gaming, sporting events, concerts, live theater, social media and restaurants. 18 Table of Contents Failure to respond adequately or in a timely fashion to changes and advancements in digital technology could negatively affect the Companys business. There have been a number of advancements in the digital cinema field in recent years. In order to keep pace with these changes and in order to continue to provide an experience which is premium to and differentiated from conventional cinema experiences, the Company has made, and expects to continue to make, significant investments in digital technology in the form of research and development and the acquisition of third party intellectual property and/or proprietary technology. Recently, the Company has made significant investments in laser technology as part of its effort to develop a next-generation laser-based digital projection system. The process of developing new technologies is inherently uncertain, and the Company can provide no assurance its investments will result in commercially viable advancements to the Companys existing products or in commercially successful new products, or that any such advancements or products will be developed within the timeframe expected. The Company conducts business internationally, which exposes it to uncertainties and risks that could negatively affect its operations, sales and future growth prospects. A significant portion of the Companys revenues are generated by customers located outside the United States and Canada. Approximately 53%, 48% and 46% of its revenues were derived outside of the United States and Canada in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In fact, 2013 marked the first year in the Companys history that revenues and gross box-office derived from outside the United States and Canada exceeded revenues and gross box-office from the United States and Canada. As at December 31, 2013, approximately 86.5% of IMAX theater systems arrangements in backlog are scheduled to be installed in international markets. Accordingly, the Company expects to expand its international operations to account for an increasingly significant portion of its revenues in the future. There are a number of risks associated with operating in international markets that could negatively affect the Companys operations, sales and future growth prospects. These risks include:  new restrictions on access to markets, both for theater systems and films;  unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements;  fluctuations in the value of foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar and potential currency devaluations;  new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and other trade barriers;  imposition of foreign exchange controls in such foreign jurisdictions;  dependence on foreign distributors and their sales channels;  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  local business practices that can present challenges to compliance with applicable anti-corruption and bribery laws;  difficulties in establishing market-appropriate pricing;  adverse changes in monetary and/or tax policies;  poor recognition of intellectual property rights;  inflation;  requirements to provide performance bonds and letters of credit to international customers to secure system component deliveries; and  political, economic and social instability. 19 Table of Contents As the Company begins to expand the number of its theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements in international markets, the Companys revenues from its international operations will become increasingly dependent on the box-office performance of its films. In addition, as the Companys international network has expanded, the Company has signed deals with movie studios in other countries to convert their films to the Companys large format and release them to IMAX theaters. The Company may be unable to select films which will be successful in international markets or unsuccessful in selecting the right mix of Hollywood and local DMR films in a particular country or region. Also, conflicts in international release schedules may make it difficult to release every IMAX film in certain markets. Finally, box-office reporting in certain countries may be less accurate and therefore less reliable than in the United States and Canada. The Company faces risks in connection with the continued expansion of its business in China. At present, Greater China is the Companys second-largest and fastest growing market. As at December 31, 2013, the Company had 173 theaters operating in Greater China with an additional 239 theaters (includes 2 upgrades) in backlog that are scheduled to be installed in Greater China by 2021. The Company has made, and continues to make significant investments in its China business. In 2011, the Company formed IMAX China, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which as of December 31, 2013 had offices in Shanghai and Beijing and 57 employees. In 2013, the Company and Wanda Cinema Line Corporation (Wanda) announced amendments of the parties original 2011 joint revenue sharing arrangement for an additional 120 IMAX theaters to be located throughout China. The most recent expansion brings Wandas total commitment to 210 IMAX theater systems, of which 195 are under the parties joint revenue sharing arrangement, and which makes it the Companys largest single international partnership to date. In addition, the Company has released an increasing number of Chinese IMAX DMR films to its growing network in Greater China in recent years, including 5 films in 2013. In October 2013, the Company also announced its joint venture with TCL to design, develop and manufacture a premium home theater system, which is set to further expand the scope of the Companys operations in China. As the Company continues to further its commitment to China, it is increasingly exposed to risks in that region. These risks include changes in laws and regulations, currency fluctuations, increased competition and changes in economic conditions, including those related to consumer spending. Adverse developments in these areas could cause the Company to lose some or all of its investment in China and could cause the Company to fail to achieve anticipated growth. Moreover, certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese law regulates both the scope of the Companys investment in China and the business conducted by it within China. For instance, the Chinese government regulates both the number and timing or terms of Hollywood films released to the China market. The Company cannot provide assurance that the Chinese government will continue to permit the release of IMAX films in China or that the timing of IMAX releases will be favorable to the Company. There are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in China. If the Company were unable to navigate Chinas regulatory environment, including with respect to its current customs inquiry, or if the Company were unable to enforce its intellectual property or contract rights in China, the Companys business could be adversely impacted. See note 13(g) Contingencies and Guarantees of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information. Under common ownership, Wanda and AMC together account for a significant and growing portion of the Companys revenue and backlog. A deterioration in the Companys relationship with Wanda and/or AMC could materially, adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition or results of operation. In 2012, Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd (Dalian Wanda), the parent company of Wanda Cinema Line (Wanda), acquired AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC). Prior to the acquisition, AMC and Wanda were, respectively, the Companys first and third largest customers. In December 2013, AMC completed an initial public offering of approximately 20% of its outstanding shares, with Dalian Wanda retaining the approximately 80% remaining. Under common ownership, Wanda and AMC together represent approximately 13.9%, 12.2% and 14.1% of the Companys total revenue in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. On December 18, 2013, Wanda exercised its option to expand its joint revenue sharing arrangement with IMAX with 80 additional IMAX theater systems. With the latest expansion of the Companys joint revenue sharing arrangement with Wanda, Wanda and AMC together represented approximately 31% of the Companys backlog as of December 31, 2013. The share of the Companys revenue that is generated by Wanda and AMC is expected to continue to grow as the significant number of Wanda theater systems currently in backlog are opened. No assurance can be given that either Wanda and/or AMC will continue to purchase theater systems and/or enter into joint revenue sharing arrangements with the Company and if so, whether contractual terms will be affected. If the Company does business with either Wanda and/or AMC less frequently or on less favorable terms than currently, the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. The Company is undertaking new lines of business and these new business initiatives may not be successful. The Company is undertaking new lines of business. These initiatives represent new areas of growth for the Company and could include the offering of new products and services that may not be accepted by the market. Some areas of potential growth for the Company are in the field of in-home entertainment technology, which is an intensively competitive business and which is dependent on consumer demand, over which the Company has no control. If any new business in which the Company invests or attempts to develop does not progress as planned, the Company may be adversely affected by investment expenses that have not led to the anticipated results, by the distraction of management from its core business or by damage to its brand or reputation. 20 Table of Contents In addition, these initiatives may involve the formation of joint ventures and business alliances. While the Company seeks to employ the optimal structure for each such business alliance, the alliance may require a high level of cooperation with and reliance on our partners and there is a possibility that the Company may have disagreements with its relevant partner with respect to financing, technological management, product development, management strategies or otherwise. Any such disagreement may cause the joint venture or business alliance to be terminated. The Company may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property, and competitors could misappropriate its technology or brand, which could weaken its competitive position. The Company depends on its proprietary knowledge regarding IMAX theater systems and digital and film technology. The Company relies principally upon a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, restrictions on disclosures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary and intellectual property rights. These laws and procedures may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized parties from attempting to copy or otherwise obtain the Companys processes and technology or deter others from developing similar processes or technology, which could weaken the Companys competitive position and require the Company to incur costs to secure enforcement of its intellectual property rights. The protection provided to the Companys proprietary technology by the laws of foreign jurisdictions may not protect it as fully as the laws of Canada or the United States. The lack of protection afforded to intellectual property rights in certain international jurisdictions may be increasingly problematic given the extent to which future growth of the Company is anticipated to come from foreign jurisdictions. Finally, some of the underlying technologies of the Companys products and system components are not covered by patents or patent applications. The Company owns or licenses patents issued and patent applications pending, including those covering its digital projector, digital conversion technology and laser illumination technology. The Companys patents are filed in the United States, often with corresponding patents or filed applications in other jurisdictions, such as Canada, China, Belgium, Japan, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The patent applications pending may not be issued or the patents may not provide the Company with any competitive advantages. The patent applications may also be challenged by third parties. Several of the Companys issued patents in the United States, Canada and Japan for improvements to IMAX projectors, IMAX 3D Dome and sound system components expire between 2016 and 2028. Any claims or litigation initiated by the Company to protect its proprietary technology could be time consuming, costly and divert the attention of its technical and management resources. The IMAX brand stands for the highest quality, most immersive motion picture entertainment. Protecting the IMAX brand is a critical element in maintaining the Companys relationships with studios and its exhibitor clients. Though the Company relies on a combination of trademark and copyright law as well as its contractual provisions to protect the IMAX brand, those protections may not be adequate to prevent erosion of the brand over time, particularly in foreign jurisdictions. Erosion of the brand could threaten the demand for the Companys products and services and impair its ability to grow future revenue streams. The Companys implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system may adversely affect the Companys business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Company began implementation of a new ERP system in the first quarter of 2013. When implementation is complete, the new ERP system is expected to deliver a new generation of work processes and information systems. However, ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities that take several years. ERP implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the ERP system. If the Company does not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or if the system does not operate as intended, it could adversely affect the Companys operations, financial reporting systems, the Companys ability to produce financial reports, and/or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to review the implementation effort as well as the impact on its internal controls over financial reporting and, where appropriate, is making changes to these controls over financial reporting to address these system changes. General political, social and economic conditions can affect the Companys business by reducing both revenue generated from existing IMAX theater systems and the demand for new IMAX theater systems. The Companys success depends in part on general political, social and economic conditions and the willingness of consumers to purchase tickets to IMAX movies. If going to the movies becomes less popular, the Companys business could be adversely affected. In addition, our operations could be adversely affected if consumers discretionary income falls as a result of an economic downturn. 21 Table of Contents In recent years, the majority of the Companys revenue has been directly derived from the box-office revenues of its films. Accordingly, any decline in attendance at commercial IMAX theaters could materially and adversely affect several sources of key revenue streams for the Company. The Company also depends on the sale and lease of IMAX theater systems to commercial movie exhibitors to generate revenue. Commercial movie exhibitors generate revenues from consumer attendance at their theaters, which depends on the willingness of consumers to visit movie theaters and spend discretionary income at movie theaters. In the event of declining box-office and concession revenues, commercial exhibitors may be less willing to invest capital in new IMAX theaters. The Company may experience adverse effects due to exchange rate fluctuations. A substantial portion of the Companys revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, while a substantial portion of its expenses are denominated in Canadian dollars. The Company also generates revenues in Chinese Yuan Renminbi, Euros and Japanese Yen. While the Company periodically enters into forward contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. and the Canadian dollar, the Company may not be successful in reducing its exposure to these fluctuations. The use of derivative contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility. The issuance of the Companys common shares and the accumulation of shares by certain shareholders could result in the loss of the Companys ability to use certain of the Companys net operating losses. As at December 31, 2013, the Company had approximately $14.8 million of U.S. consolidated federal tax and certain other state tax net operating loss carryforwards. Realization of some or all of the benefit from these U.S. net tax operating losses is dependent on the absence of certain ownership changes of the Companys common shares. An ownership change, as defined in the applicable federal income tax rules, would place possible limitations, on an annual basis, on the use of such net operating losses to offset any future taxable income that the Company may generate. Such limitations, in conjunction with the net operating loss expiration provisions, could significantly reduce or effectively eliminate the Companys ability to use its U.S. net operating losses to offset any future taxable income. The Companys revenues from existing customers are derived in part from financial reporting provided by its customers, which may be inaccurate or incomplete, resulting in lost or delayed revenues. The Companys revenue under its joint revenue sharing arrangements, a portion of the Companys payments under lease or sales arrangements and its film license fees are based upon financial reporting provided by its customers. If such reporting is inaccurate, incomplete or withheld, the Companys ability to receive the appropriate payments in a timely fashion that are due to it may be impaired. The Companys contractual ability to audit IMAX theaters may not rectify payments lost or delayed as a result of customers not fulfilling their contractual obligations with respect to financial reporting. There is collection risk associated with payments to be received over the terms of the Companys theater system agreements. The Company is dependent in part on the viability of its exhibitors for collections under long-term leases, sales financing agreements and joint revenue sharing arrangements. Exhibitors or other operators may experience financial difficulties that could cause them to be unable to fulfill their contractual payment obligations to the Company. As a result, the Companys future revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected. The Company may not convert all of its backlog into revenue and cash flows. At December 31, 2013, the Companys sales backlog included 407 theater systems, consisting of 144 systems under sales arrangements and 263 theater systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements. The Company lists signed contracts for theater systems for which revenue has not been recognized as sales backlog prior to the time of revenue recognition. The total value of the sales backlog represents all signed theater system sale or lease agreements that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the future and includes initial fees along with the present value of fixed minimum ongoing fees due over the term, but excludes contingent fees in excess of fixed minimum ongoing fees that might be received in the future and maintenance and extended warranty fees. Notwithstanding the legal obligation to do so, not all of the Companys customers with which it has signed contracts may accept delivery of theater systems that are included in the Companys backlog. This could adversely affect the Companys future revenues and cash flows. In addition, customers with theater system obligations in backlog sometimes request that the Company agree to modify or reduce such obligations, which the Company has agreed to in the past under certain circumstances. Customer requested delays in the installation of theater systems in backlog remain a recurring and unpredictable part of the Companys business. 22 Table of Contents The Company is dependent on a single supplier, the Eastman Kodak Company, for its analog film. Kodak is the Companys sole supplier of analog film. Kodak has stated publicly that it intends to continue to own and operate its film products business, and to date, Kodak has continued to supply the Company with analog film. However, the Company can provide no assurance that Kodak either will continue to supply analog film under terms acceptable to the Company, or that it will continue to manufacture film at all. Furthermore, Fujifilm Corporation, which had been another significant supplier of analog film to the movie industry, announced in September 2012 that it would cease production for motion pictures beginning in March 2013. Although the Company expects to release only a very small number of analog film prints in 2014, as of December 31, 2013, the Company had 141 film-based theaters in its network, and the Company also uses analog film in its film-based cameras. Without a sufficient supply of analog film, the Company may be unable to supply film prints to its film-based theater customers, and it may be unable to utilize its film-based cameras for shooting IMAX films. The Companys operating results and cash flow can vary substantially from quarter to quarter and could increase the volatility of its share price. The Companys operating results and cash flow can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter. In particular, fluctuations in theater system installations and gross box-office performance of IMAX DMR content can materially affect operating results. Factors that have affected the Companys operating results and cash flow in the past, and are likely to affect its operating results and cash flow in the future, include, among other things:  the timing of signing and installation of new theater systems;  the timing and commercial success of films distributed to the Companys theater network;  the demand for, and acceptance of, its products and services;  the recognition of revenue of sales and sales-type leases;  the classification of leases as sales-type versus operating leases;  the volume of orders received and that can be filled in the quarter;  the level of its sales backlog;  the signing of film distribution agreements;  the financial performance of IMAX theaters operated by the Companys customers and by the Company;  financial difficulties faced by customers, particularly customers in the commercial exhibition industry;  the magnitude and timing of spending in relation to the Companys research and development efforts and related investments as well as new business initiatives; and  the number and timing of joint revenue sharing arrangement installations, related capital expenditures and timing of related cash receipts. Most of the Companys operating expenses are fixed in the short term. The Company may be unable to rapidly adjust its spending to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in sales, joint revenue sharing arrangements revenue or IMAX DMR revenue which would harm quarterly operating results, although the results of any quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of its results for any other quarter or for a full fiscal year. 23 Table of Contents The Companys theater system revenue can vary significantly from its cash flows under theater system sales or lease agreements. The Companys theater systems revenue can vary significantly from the associated cash flows. The Company often provides financing to customers for theater systems on a long-term basis through long-term leases or notes receivables. The terms of leases or notes receivable are typically 10 years. The Companys sale and lease-type agreements typically provide for three major sources of cash flow related to theater systems:  initial fees, which are paid in installments generally commencing upon the signing of the agreement until installation of the theater systems;  ongoing fees, which are paid monthly after all theater systems have been installed and are generally equal to the greater of a fixed minimum amount per annum and a percentage of box-office receipts; and  ongoing annual maintenance and extended warranty fees, which are generally payable commencing in the second year of theater operations. Initial fees generally make up the vast majority of cash received under theater system sales or lease agreements for a theater arrangement. For sales and sales-type leases, the revenue recorded is generally equal to the sum of initial fees and the present value of minimum ongoing fees due under the agreement. Cash received from initial fees in advance of meeting the revenue recognition criteria for the theater systems is recorded as deferred revenue. Contingent fees are recognized as they are reported by the theaters after annual minimum fixed fees are exceeded. Leases that do not transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to the customer are classified as operating leases. For these leases, initial fees and minimum fixed ongoing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent fees are recognized as they are reported by the theaters after annual minimum fixed fees are exceeded. As a result of the above, the revenue set forth in the Companys financial statements does not necessarily correlate with the Companys cash flow or cash position. Revenues include the present value of future contracted cash payments and there is no guarantee that the Company will receive such payments under its lease and sale agreements if its customers default on their payment obligations. The Companys stock price has historically been volatile and declines in market price, including as a result a market downturn, may negatively affect its ability to raise capital, issue debt, secure customer business and retain employees. The Company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and its publicly traded shares have in the past experienced, and may continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility could reduce the market price of its common stock, regardless of the Companys operating performance. A decline in the capital markets generally, or an adjustment in the market price or trading volumes of the Companys publicly traded securities, may negatively affect its ability to raise capital, issue debt, secure customer business or retain employees. These factors, as well as general economic and geopolitical conditions, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Companys publicly traded securities. The credit agreement governing the Companys senior secured credit facility contains significant restrictions that limit its operating and financial flexibility. The credit agreement governing the Companys senior secured credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to:  incur additional indebtedness;  pay dividends and make distributions;  repurchase stock;  make certain investments; 24 Table of Contents  transfer or sell assets;  create liens;  enter into transactions with affiliates;  issue or sell stock of subsidiaries;  create dividend or other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries; and  merge, consolidate, amalgamate or sell all or substantially all of its assets to another person. These restrictive covenants impose operating and financial restrictions on the Company that limit the Companys ability to engage in acts that may be in the Companys long-term best interests. The Company is subject to impairment losses on its film assets. The Company amortizes its film assets, including IMAX DMR costs capitalized using the individual film forecast method, whereby the costs of film assets are amortized and participation costs are accrued for each film in the ratio of revenues earned in the current period to managements estimate of total revenues ultimately expected to be received for that title. Management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its estimates of ultimate revenues on a title-by-title basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of the film assets and write-downs or impairments of film assets. Results of operations in future years include the amortization of the Companys film assets and may be significantly affected by periodic adjustments in amortization rates. The Company is subject to impairment losses on its inventories. The Company records write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory based upon current estimates of future events and conditions, including the anticipated installation dates for the current backlog of theater system contracts, technological developments, signings in negotiation and anticipated market acceptance of the Companys current and pending theater systems. Since the Company introduced a proprietary digitally-based IMAX projection system, increased customer acceptance and preference for the Companys digital projection system may subject existing film-based inventories to further write-downs (resulting in lower margins) as these theater systems become less desirable in the future. If the Companys goodwill or long lived assets become impaired the Company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP), the Company reviews its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be qualitatively assessed at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances arise or can be quantitatively tested for impairment. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances include (but are not limited to) a decline in stock price and market capitalization, declines in future cash flows, and slower growth rates in the Companys industry. The Company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or long lived assets is determined. Changes in accounting and changes in managements estimates may affect the Companys reported earnings and operating income. U.S. GAAP and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of the Companys business, such as revenue recognition, film accounting, accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, accounting for income taxes, and treatment of goodwill or long lived assets, are highly complex and involve many subjective judgments. Changes in these rules, their interpretation, managements estimates, or changes in the Companys products or business could significantly change its reported future earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures, without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations. See Critical Accounting Policies in Item 7. 25 Table of Contents The Company relies on its key personnel, and the loss of one or more of those personnel could harm its ability to carry out its business strategy. The Companys operations and prospects depend in large part on the performance and continued service of its senior management team. The Company may not find qualified replacements for any of these individuals if their services are no longer available. The loss of the services of one or more members of the Companys senior management team could adversely affect its ability to effectively pursue its business strategy. Because the Company is incorporated in Canada, it may be difficult for plaintiffs to enforce against the Company liabilities based solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. The Company is incorporated under the federal laws of Canada, some of its directors and officers are residents of Canada and a substantial portion of its assets and the assets of such directors and officers are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for U.S. plaintiffs to effect service within the United States upon those directors or officers who are not residents of the United States, or to realize against them or the Company in the United States upon judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability under the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for plaintiffs to bring an original action outside of the United States against the Company to enforce liabilities based solely on U.S. federal securities laws.
