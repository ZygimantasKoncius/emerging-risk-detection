These forward-looking statements and the above-described risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this Annual Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement.Financial Information About Operating SegmentsFinancial information about our reportable segments appears in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.I-7Narrative Description of BusinessBroadband DistributionOverviewWe offer a variety of broadband services over our cable distribution systems, including video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony and, in certain of our operations, we offer mobile services. We design these services to enable our customers to access the digital world on their own terms and at their own pace. In most of our footprint, the core of our offer to customers is “triple-play”, which we use to describe bundled services of digital video, internet and fixed-line telephony in one subscription. We are enhancing this offer by expanding our services to include mobile in certain markets. Available service offerings depend on the bandwidth capacity of a particular system and whether it has been upgraded for two-way communications. In select markets, we also offer video services through DTH or through multichannel multipoint (microwave) distribution systems (MMDS). Our consumer brands include Virgin Media, Ziggo, UPC, Unitymedia Kabel BW, Telenet, VTR and in Puerto Rico, Liberty. In 2015, we will replace the UPC brand in the Netherlands with the Ziggo brand. Also in 2015, we will use solely the Unitymedia brand in Germany, discontinuing the Kabel BW brand. In terms of video subscribers, we operate the largest cable network in each of Austria, Belgium, Chile, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, Puerto Rico, Slovakia, Switzerland and the U.K. and the second largest cable network in each of Germany and Romania. I-8The following table presents certain operating data as of December 31, 2014, with respect to the cable, DTH and MMDS systems of our subsidiaries in Europe, Chile and Puerto Rico.

Our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. We do not count homes passed for DTH. With respect to MMDS, one MMDS customer is equal to one Home Passed. Due to the fact that we do not own the partner networks (defined below) used in Switzerland and the Netherlands (see note 11 below), we do not report homes passed for Switzerland’s and the Netherlands’ partner networks.(2)Two-way Homes Passed are Homes Passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way services, including video, internet and fixed-line telephony services. (3)Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or fixed-line telephony services that we count as Revenue Generating Units (RGUs), without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. To the extent that RGU counts include equivalent billing unit (EBU) adjustments, we reflect corresponding adjustments to our Customer Relationship counts. For further information regarding our EBU calculation, see Additional General Notes to Tables below. Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile customers from Customer Relationships. For Belgium, Customer Relationships only include customers who subscribe to an analog or digital cable service due to billing system limitations.(4)Revenue Generating Unit is separately an Analog Cable Subscriber, Digital Cable Subscriber, DTH Subscriber, MMDS Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Fixed-line Telephony Subscriber. A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer in our Austrian system subscribed to our digital cable service, fixed-line telephony service and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Analog Cable, Digital Cable, DTH, MMDS, Internet and Fixed-line Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or fixed-line telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers, free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our December 31, 2014 RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers in the U.K., Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Chile, Hungary, Poland, Switzerland and Austria of 3,053,000, 894,500, 309,800, 129,500, 110,500, 11,200, 10,600, 8,800 and 200, respectively. Our mobile subscriber count represents the number of active subscriber identification module (SIM) cards in service.(5)Analog Cable Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our analog cable service over our broadband network. Our Analog Cable Subscriber counts also include subscribers who may use a purchased set-top box or other means to receive our basic digital cable channels without subscribing to any services that would require the payment of recurring monthly fees in addition to the basic analog service fee (Basic Digital Cable Subscriber). Our Basic Digital Cable Subscribers are attributable to the fact that our basic digital cable channels are not encrypted in certain portions of our footprint and the use of purchased digital set-top boxes in Belgium. In Europe, we have approximately 110,600 “lifeline” customers that are counted on a per connection basis, representing the least expensive regulated tier of video cable service, with only a few channels. (6)Digital Cable Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our digital cable service over our broadband network or through a partner network. We count a subscriber with one or more digital converter boxes that receives our digital cable service in one premises as just one subscriber. A Digital Cable Subscriber is not counted as an Analog Cable Subscriber. As we migrate customers from analog to digital cable services, we report a decrease in our Analog Cable Subscribers equal to the increase in our Digital Cable Subscribers. As discussed in further detail in note 5 above, Basic Digital Cable Subscribers are not included in the respective Digital Cable Subscriber counts. Subscribers to digital cable services provided by our operations in Switzerland and the Netherlands over partner networks receive analog cable services from the partner networks as opposed to our operations. (7)DTH Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming broadcast directly via a geosynchronous satellite. (8)MMDS Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming via MMDS.(9)Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Our Internet Subscribers exclude 89,200 asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) subscribers within our U.K. segment and 65,900 digital subscriber line (DSL) subscribers within our Austria segment that are not serviced over our networks. Our Internet Subscribers do not include customers that receive services from dial-up connections. In Switzerland, we offer a 2 Mbps internet service to our Analog and Digital Cable Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Internet Subscribers in Switzerland include 66,800 subscribers who have requested and received this service.I-10(10)Fixed-line Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Fixed-line Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. Our Fixed-line Telephony Subscribers exclude 59,300 and 48,400 subscribers within our segments in the U.K. and Austria, respectively, that are not serviced over our networks. In Switzerland, we offer a basic phone service to our Analog and Digital Cable Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony Subscribers in Switzerland include 2,800 subscribers who have requested and received this service. (11)Pursuant to service agreements, Switzerland and, to a much lesser extent, the Netherlands offer digital cable, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services over networks owned by third-party cable operators (partner networks). A partner network RGU is only recognized if there is a direct billing relationship with the customer. At December 31, 2014, Switzerland’s partner networks account for 143,600 Customer Relationships, 279,500 RGUs, 107,700 Digital Cable Subscribers, 101,900 Internet Subscribers and 69,900 Fixed-line Telephony Subscribers. Additional General Notes to Table:Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide fixed-line telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other business services. Certain of our business service revenue is derived from small or home office (SOHO) subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or fixed-line telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. With the exception of our business SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of business services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.Certain of our residential and commercial RGUs are counted on an EBU basis, including residential multiple dwelling units and commercial establishments, such as bars, hotels and hospitals, in Chile and Puerto Rico and certain commercial and residential multiple dwelling units in Europe (with the exception of Germany and Belgium, where we do not count any RGUs on an EBU basis). Our EBUs are generally calculated by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service. As such, we may experience variances in our EBU counts solely as a result of changes in rates. In Germany, homes passed reflect the footprint, and two-way homes passed reflect the technological capability of our network up to the street cabinet, with drops from the street cabinet to the building generally added, and in-home wiring generally upgraded, on an as needed or success-based basis. In Belgium, Telenet leases a portion of its network under a long-term capital lease arrangement. These tables include operating statistics for Telenet’s owned and leased networks. While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (1) the nature and pricing of products and services, (2) the distribution platform, (3) billing systems, (4) bad debt collection experience and (5) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews. Subscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies. I-11Residential Services•Video. Our cable operations offer a full range of video services, including basic and premium programming, which can be viewed on the television and, in select markets, through internet connected devices in the home and whenever there is internet connectivity. We provide advanced service offerings, such as an electronic programming guide, high definition (HD) channels, digital video recorders (DVR) and HD DVR. In certain markets, our advance service offerings also include video-on-demand (VoD) and advance next generation set-top boxes like the multimedia home gateway “Horizon TV” or the “TiVo” service offered by Virgin Media in the U.K. These services, together with DVR and HD DVR functionality, give our customers the ability to control when they watch their programming. In several of our markets, we have enhanced pay-per-view programming on channels we distribute and through VoD. In addition, we offer select programming in three-dimensional (3D) format to our customers who have 3D capable televisions. Several of our operations offer television applications (apps) that allow access to programming on a variety of devices, including laptops, smartphones and tablets. To receive our digital services, a subscriber must either rent a set-top box from our operators, or purchase one and obtain a conditional access security card, or a “smart card”, from our operators. Neither a set-top box nor a smart card is required to receive basic digital television channels in our unencrypted footprints. Accordingly, where our basic digital television channels are unencrypted, subscribers are able to also watch our basic digital television channels, provided that they pay the monthly subscription fee for our analog package and have televisions capable of receiving digital signals. The basic digital television channels in our entire footprints in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic and Romania are unencrypted as of December 31, 2014. In the Netherlands, the footprint of UPC Nederland is also unencrypted. We plan to unencrypt the digital versions of our basic analog tier in our entire footprint in the Netherlands in 2015 and we may take similar steps in additional markets in 2015 and future periods. Regardless of whether basic digital channels are offered on an unencrypted basis, expanded channel packages and premium channels and services continue to be available for an incremental monthly fee in all of our markets.In some of our markets, instead of a set-top box, a subscriber may use a common interface plus (CI+) module to access our encrypted digital services. A CI+ module is a small device (credit card size) that allows customers with a CI+ enabled television set, who subscribe to, or otherwise have access to, our digital video service, to view such services without a set-top box. No set-top box, CI+ module or smart card is required to receive our analog or unencrypted basic digital services.Our cable operations generally offer two or three tiers of digital video programming and audio services. Subscribers to our basic digital video service pay a fixed monthly fee and generally receive at least 60 video channels and several audio services. This service also includes VoD access and an electronic programming guide. In our markets where our basic digital service is not encrypted, the cost of our digital service is the same cost as our analog services. In the markets where we encrypt our basic digital service, our digital service is generally offered at an incremental cost equal to or slightly higher than the monthly fee for our basic analog service. For an additional monthly charge, a subscriber may upgrade to one of our extended digital tier services and receive an increased number of video channels, including the channels in the basic tier service. A limited number of HD channels are generally included in our basic tiers of service. Digital subscribers may also subscribe to one or more packages of premium channels, including additional HD channels. In all digital tiers of service, a subscriber also has the option for an incremental monthly charge to upgrade the standard digital device to one with DVR or HD DVR capabilities, which may be rented or purchased. Customers who subscribe to a digital tier generally receive a VoD enabled set-top box without an additional monthly charge. Our VoD services, including catch-up television, are available on a subscription basis or a transaction basis, depending on location and the tier of digital service selected by the subscriber.In addition to our digital video services, we offer limited analog services in all of our broadband markets, except in the U.K. and in Puerto Rico. Subscribers to our analog video service typically receive 21 to 67 channels of video service, depending on their location. Subscribers to our digital services also receive the channels available through our analog service. In Ireland and Slovakia, we offer a limited number of video channels through MMDS. Discounts to our monthly service fees are available to any subscriber who selects a bundle of two or more of our services (bundled services): video, internet, fixed-line telephony and, in certain markets, mobile services. Bundled services consist of “double-play” for two services, “triple-play” for three services and “quadruple-play” for four services. We tailor our tiers of video services in each country of operation based on programming preferences, culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements. Our channel offerings include general entertainment, sports, movies, documentaries, lifestyles, news, adult, children and ethnic and foreign channels. In each of our markets, we also offer a variety of premium channel packages (such as sports, family and international focus) and our VoD service provides a wide variety of movies I-12and special events to meet the special interests of our subscribers. In all of our broadband operations, we continue to upgrade our systems to expand our digital services and encourage our analog subscribers to convert to a digital or premium digital service.We offer digital video services through DTH satellite in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. We offer these services through UPC DTH S.á.r.l (UPC DTH), a subsidiary of UPC Holding organized in Luxembourg, which also has a management arrangement with another subsidiary, FocusSat Romania Srl (FocusSat), to provide these services in Romania. Similar to our video cable services, we offer a lifeline tier of service, a basic video tier of service and, for an additional monthly charge, subscribers may upgrade to an extended tier of service and may subscribe to various premium channel packages. •Interactive Services. To enhance our customers video experience, we offer “Horizon TV”, a next generation multimedia home gateway, in Germany, Switzerland, Ireland and in the UPC Nederland footprint of the Netherlands. Horizon TV is a central media platform that is capable of distributing video, voice and data content throughout the home and to multiple devices. It has a sophisticated user interface that enables customers to view linear channels, VoD programming and personal media content and to pause, replay and record programming. The Horizon TV platform sets up a wireless network that connects the digital video content available on the television to other devices, such as laptops, smartphones and tablets. It also integrates access to personal media content, such as photos, music and movies stored in the home network. The box for Horizon TV has six inbuilt tuners, two of which are dedicated to channel-surfing. This allows the customer to view programming information while their current program is playing. Also, up to four programs can be recorded simultaneously and up to four devices can connect to the Horizon TV box at the same time and view different content. In certain markets, we offer a box for Horizon TV without the recording functionality. For our multimedia gateway customers, we also offer apps for various services. We intend to (1) expand the availability of Horizon TV to other markets within our footprint and (2) continue to improve the Horizon TV user experience with new functionality and software updates.For our Horizon TV subscribers, we offer apps for various online services (such as YouTube, Facebook, Picasa and others). The Horizon family of products also includes an online television app for viewing on a second screen called “Horizon Go” that allows video customers to view linear channels, with many channels available outside of the home. Horizon Go also offers access to VoD, and, for Horizon TV customers, when in the home, the second screen devices also act as a remote control. We also have available through Horizon Go the ability to remotely schedule the recording of a television program on the Horizon TV box at home through an iOS or Android mobile digital device or an internet web browser. Other iOS and Android apps that are available allow customers to use their smartphone as an extension of their home phone line. At December 31, 2014, we had 911,700 Horizon TV subscribers. We are expanding the Horizon TV experience through cloud TV, including cloud DVR, VoD navigation and advanced applications. The Horizon TV cloud platform allows users to stream experiences to set-top boxes and CI+ modules. It also integrates access to personal media content, such as photos, music and movies stored in the home or in the cloud, enabling access on devices both in and outside the home. In November 2014, we launched this cloud-based Horizon TV platform in select areas in Poland, followed by a full commercial launch in January 2015. In Poland, we had over 1,800 Horizon TV subscribers at December 31, 2014. Digital video experiences are offered by us through the “TiVo” platform in the U.K. under a strategic partnership agreement with TiVo Inc. The TiVo boxes provide converged television and broadband internet capabilities. In addition, we have launched our subscription VoD offering, which we refer to as “MyPrime”. MyPrime offers customers unlimited streaming access to a library of on-demand content. Each library has been tailored to the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and competitive offers. Generally, the library contains 1,500 movies and 2,000 TV episodes from local and international suppliers such as ABC/Disney, NBC/Universal, CBS/Paramount, Warner TV and Sony. The MyPrime offering also includes over 500 children’s episodes. Where available, MyPrime is included with the Horizon TV platform services (or separately as a premium channel for non-Horizon TV subscribers). We have launched MyPrime in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Poland and Hungary.•Broadband Internet. We offer multiple tiers of broadband internet service in all of our broadband communications markets. Depending on location, this service includes download speeds ranging from less than 1 Mbps to an ultra high-speed internet service of 500 Mbps in Hungary and Romania. To a select market in Switzerland, we also have available an ultra high-speed internet service with download speeds of up to 500 Mbps. Our key mass-market package in most of our European operations include a download speed of up to 120 Mbps. Generally, we provide our broadband internet service without any time or data volume restrictions. Our ultra high-speed internet service is based primarily on Euro I-13DOCSIS 3.0 technology, which is an international standard that defines requirements for a data transmission over a cable system. Our internet service generally includes email, address book, parental controls and online audio. We also offer value-added broadband services through certain of our operations for an incremental charge. These services include security (e.g., anti-virus and spam protection) and online storage and web spaces. In certain of our markets, we offer mobile broadband services as described under —Mobile below. Our residential subscribers generally access the internet via cable modems connected to their internet capable devices, including personal computers, at various speeds depending on the tier of service selected. This standard means of access is changing as we expand our services to offer wireless networks for the home. In certain of our markets, we are deploying a community WiFi in the home (Community WiFi), which provides a seamless connectivity experience over WiFi to our customers. The Community WiFi is branded as “Wi-Free” in Belgium, Switzerland, Ireland, Poland, Hungry and Romania, as “WifiSpots” in the Netherlands and as “WiFi Buddy” in the U.K. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately 5.1 million WiFi access points in our European footprint. In 2015, through an agreement with Comcast Corporation, our internet customers will also have access to millions of new WiFi access points in the U.S. and across various European countries, for no additional costs. In the U.K., Virgin Media’s customers have access to an extensive network of public WiFi access points, including in the London underground train stations.Community WiFi is enabled by a cable modem WiFi access point (WiFi modem) in the set-top box, and starting in 2014 the Horizon TV box, of our internet customers. Access is free for our internet customers. The Community WiFi is created through the sharing of access to the public channel of our customers’ home wireless routers. The public channel is a separate network from the secure private network used by the customer within the home and is automatically enabled when the WiFi modem is installed. By using the WiFi modems and the Horizon TV box, the Community WiFi does not affect the internet speeds of our customers. In the Netherlands, Romania and Switzerland, a subscriber must subscribe to our video service in order to subscribe to our internet service. In our other markets, our broadband internet service is available on a standalone basis or in combination with one or more of our other services. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee based on the tier of service selected. In addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon subscribing to an internet service. This one time fee may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of speed, market conditions and other factors. •Telephony. Multi-feature fixed-line telephony services are available through our managed, quality of service based voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) technology in all of our broadband communication markets. In the U.K., Chile and Hungary, we also provide traditional circuit-switched fixed-line telephony services. We pay interconnection fees to telephony providers when calls by our subscribers terminate on another network and receive similar fees from providers when calls by their users terminate on our network through interconnection points. Our fixed-line telephony service may be selected in several of our markets on a standalone basis and in all of our markets in combination with one or more of our other services. Our fixed-line telephony service includes a basic fixed-line telephony product for line rental and various calling plans, which may consist of any of the following: unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. We also offer value added services, such as a personal call manager, unified messaging and a second or third phone line at an incremental cost. In some of our markets, we offer a phone app that allows our fixed-line telephony customers with smartphones to use their fixed-line call packages. •Mobile. We offer mobile services, both data and voice, as an MVNO over third-party networks in the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Chile and Hungary. In Poland we have a small legacy MVNO service that we maintain for those subscribers. We plan to add MVNO arrangements in certain of our other broadband communication markets. The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary and Chile provide their mobile telephony services as full MVNOs through partnerships with a third-party mobile network operator in their respective footprints. All of these operations lease the third party’s radio access network and, except for the network in the footprint of Ziggo, own the core network, including switching, backbone, interconnections, etc. These arrangements permit us to offer our customers in these markets all mobile services using the core network without having to build and operate a cellular radio tower network. In the U.K. and Germany, we provide mobile telephony as light MVNOs. In these countries, we lease the core network as well as the radio access network from a mobile network operator. These arrangements permit our customers in these countries to have access to the third party mobile communications services while we maintain the customer relationship. We offer our mobile services throughout the U.K., Belgium, Austria and Chile. Our mobile services in Hungary are available in select areas, with full commercial launch expected in March 2015. In the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland, we offer our mobile service to our customers located within our footprints who subscribe to at least one of our other products: video, broadband internet or fixed-line telephony. I-14Where mobile services are available within our operations, subscribers pay varying monthly fees depending on whether the mobile service is included with our fixed-line telephony service or includes mobile data services via mobile phones, tablets or laptops. Our mobile services typically include voice, short message service (or SMS) and internet or data access. Calls, both within and out of network, incur a charge or are covered under a postpaid monthly service plan. Our standalone mobile services are primarily on a postpaid basis with customers subscribing to services for periods ranging from activation for a SIM-only contract to up to 24 months, with the latter often taken with a subsidized mobile handset. In Belgium, however, our postpaid service is offered without a minimum contract term. In the U.K., we also offer a prepaid service, where the customers pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime or data and generally have no minimum contract term. In almost all of our markets, subscribers to a double-or triple-play bundle receive a discount on their mobile service fee. Business ServicesIn addition to our residential services, we offer voice, broadband internet, data, video, wireless and cloud services to business customers and public sector organizations. Our business services are designed to meet the specific demands of the business customer. These services differ from residential services in several fundamental ways, such as bandwidth, service levels, billing, security services and the blending of public and private network features. Our business customers include SOHO (generally fewer than 10 employees), small business and medium and large enterprises, as well as on a wholesale basis to other operators. In addition, in some of our markets, we target specific industry segments, such as financial institutions, health care facilities, education institutions and government offices, with tailored solutions combining our standard services with value added features, such as dedicated customer care and enhanced service performance monitoring. We also offer a range of data, voice and internet services to carriers, internet service providers (ISPs) and mobile operators. Our business services are designed to meet the specific demands of our business customers with a wide range of services. These services fall into five broad categories: (1) VoIP and circuit-switch telephony, hosted private branch exchange solutions and conferencing options, (2) data services for internet access, virtual private networks Ethernet transport and high capacity point-to-point services, (3) video programming packages and select channel lineups for targeted industries, (4) wireless services for mobile voice and data, as well as WiFi networks, and (5) value added services, including webhosting, managed security systems and storage and cloud enabled software. Our business services are provided to customers at established prices based on the type of services received, the volume and the duration of the service agreement. SOHO and small business customers pay business market prices on a monthly subscription basis to receive enhanced service levels and business features that support their needs. For more advanced business services, these customers generally enter into a service agreement. For medium to large business customers, we enter into individual agreements that address their needs. These agreements are generally for a period of one or more years. Technology In almost all of our markets, our video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services are transmitted over a hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. This network is composed primarily of fiber optics with only the last part that connects the home to the network composed of coaxial cable. Over 97% of our network allows for two-way communications and is flexible enough to support our current services, as well as new services. In addition, the capacity available on our network increases as our analog subscribers switch to a digital service. This is because multiple digital channels can be compressed into the same space as a single analog channel in the broadcast spectrum. The available space can then be used for other purposes, such as VoD services and high broadband speeds. We continue to explore new technologies that will enhance our customer’s connected entertainment experience, such as:•recapturing bandwidth and optimizing our networks by: ◦increasing the number of nodes in our markets; ◦increasing the bandwidth of our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network to 1 GHz;◦converting analog channels;◦bonding additional 3.0 channels; and ◦using digital compression technologies;I-15•increasing the efficiency of our networks by moving headend functions (encoding, transcoding and multiplexing) to the cloud; •enhancing our network to accommodate business services;•using wireless technologies to extend our services outside the home;•offering remote access to our video services through laptops, smartphones and tablets; and•developing and introducing next-generation platforms through multimedia home gateways or online media sharing and streaming or cloud based video, as well as enhanced next generation user interfaces for existing set-top boxes. In addition, we may expand our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network into new market areas. For example, in 2015, we plan to undertake a network extension program in the U.K. See Item 7. Overview.We deliver our high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our cable network. The cable networks of our operations are connected to our “aorta” backbone, a tier 1 carrier, that permits us to serve our customers through settlement free collaboration with other carriers without the cost of using a third-party network. Supply Sources For our video services, we license almost all of our programming and on-demand offerings from broadcast and cable programming networks, as well as DTH content providers. For such licenses, we generally pay a monthly fee on a per channel or per subscriber basis. We generally enter into long-term programming licenses with volume discounts and marketing support. For on-demand programming and streaming services, we generally enter into shorter-term agreements. For our distribution agreements, we seek to include the rights to offer the licensed programming to our customers through multiple delivery platforms and through our apps for smartphones and tablets. We purchase each type of customer premise equipment from a number of different suppliers with at least two or more suppliers for our high-volume products. Customer premise equipment includes set-top boxes, modems, CI+ modules, DVRs, tuners and similar devices. For each type of equipment, we retain specialists to provide customer support. For our broadband services, we use a variety of suppliers for our network equipment and the various services we offer. Similarly, we use a variety of suppliers for mobile handsets to offer customers in our operations with mobile services.We license software products, including email and security software, and content, such as news feeds, from several suppliers for our internet services. The agreements for these products require us to pay a per subscriber fee for software licenses and a share of advertising revenue for content licenses. For our TiVo service in the U.K., we have a partnership arrangement where TiVo is the exclusive provider of the user interface software for our next generation set-top boxes, which provide converged television and broadband internet capabilities, and we are the exclusive distributor of the TiVo services and technology in the U.K. For our fixed-line telephony services, we license software products, such as voicemail, text messaging and caller ID, from a variety of suppliers. For these licenses we seek to enter into long-term contracts, which generally require us to pay based on usage of the services.I-16The following table presents certain penetration and network data as of December 31, 2014, with respect to the cable systems of our consolidated subsidiaries in Europe, Chile and Puerto Rico.

OperationsProvided below is country-specific information with respect to the broadband communications and DTH services of our subsidiaries.•United Kingdom and Ireland. The European Operations Division operates a cable network in the U.K. under the Virgin Media brand and cable and MMDS networks in Ireland under the UPC brand (UPC Ireland). Both Virgin Media’s and UPC Ireland’s video services include a broad range of digital interactive services, including VoD, and a range of premium subscription-based and pay-per-view services. U.K. Virgin Media offers triple-play services consisting of video, internet and fixed-line telephony in parts of many metropolitan areas in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Virgin Media also offers quadruple-play services that include mobile voice and data services as an MVNO through an arrangement with a mobile communications provider. As a complement to its broadband services, Virgin Media offers a comprehensive internet streaming video service, Virgin TV Anywhere, that allows its video customers to stream up to 103 real-time video channels and watch VoD content anywhere in the U.K. where they have a broadband connection. The streaming service is available at no extra cost to Virgin Media’s digital video customers. In addition, Virgin Media offers the multimedia home gateway TiVo to its digital video customers. Customers can record up to three programs simultaneously when watching an existing recording. TiVo customers can also access real-time television channels and manage their TiVo box with a laptop, smartphone or tablet. When in the home, these devices also act as a remote control for TiVo. It also offers a TiVo app for the Netflix video service that allows up to five individual profiles on a single account. At December 31, 2014, Virgin Media had 2.5 million connected TiVo customers. Virgin Media does not offer an analog video service.Virgin Media offers its subscribers premium digital channels from Sky plc (Sky) through an agreement with Sky and premium BT Sport channels through an agreement with BT Group plc (BT). Virgin Media subscribers may receive these channels through a smart card on Virgin Media’s network as part of Virgin Media’s services or for an incremental subscription fee. In addition, Virgin Media subscribers using TiVo may access internet programming services and a Eurosport app pursuant to agreements between Virgin Media and such service providers.Through its twisted copper network, Virgin Media offers fixed-line telephony services to its residential customers. It offers its mobile service on both a prepaid and postpaid basis. Virgin Media’s telephony services via VoIP are only available to its business customers. In addition, Virgin Media offers mobile services and its customers have access to an extensive network of public WiFi hotspots, including in the London underground train (or Tube) stations.I-20Ireland. UPC Ireland’s operations are located in five regional clusters, including the capital city of Dublin and other cities, including Cork, Galway and Limerick. To complement its digital offering, UPC Ireland offers its digital subscribers several premium channels (sports, movies, adult, ethnic and kids). UPC Ireland’s services include Horizon TV and, at December 31, 2014, it had 113,000 connected Horizon TV subscribers. It also offers Horizon Go, giving access to linear channels and VoD programming. For its business customers, UPC Ireland has introduced a number of Community WiFi networks. In January 2015, UPC Ireland increased its fastest broadband internet download speed to 240 Mbps. Also in 2015, UPC Ireland will expand its products to include mobile services as an MVNO. •Germany. The operations of the European Operations Division in Germany are currently conducted under the brands Unitymedia and Kabel BW (collectively, Unitymedia KabelBW). Unitymedia KabelBW’s operations are located in the German federal states of Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse and include the major cities of Cologne, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Essen, Frankfurt, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Stuttgart and Wiesbaden. Unitymedia KabelBW offers triple-play services consisting of video, internet and fixed-line telephony services in nearly all of its footprint. Unitymedia KabelBW offers a CI+ module to its video cable customers for an incremental monthly charge. No set-top box, CI+ module or smart card is, however, required to receive basic digital services because our basic digital service is unencrypted in our German footprint. In September 2013, Unitymedia KabelBW launched Horizon TV in North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse followed by a launch in Baden-Württemberg in November 2014. At December 31, 2014, Unitymedia KabelBW had over 245,000 connected Horizon TV subscribers. Through an agreement with Sky Deutschland AG (Sky Deutschland), Unitymedia KabelBW offers its subscribers premium video channels from Sky Deutschland. Unitymedia KabelBW subscribers may receive Sky Deutschland channels for an incremental subscription fee through a smart card on the Unitymedia KabelBW network. VoD is available to subscribers to its digital video service on a pay-per-view basis and includes HD and 3D content. In addition, Unitymedia KabelBW offers Horizon Go, giving subscribers access to 100 linear channels of which 13 channels plus VoD programming may be accessed remotely. Approximately two-thirds of Unitymedia KabelBW’s video customers are in multiple dwelling units where Unitymedia KabelBW has the billing relationship with the landlord or housing association or with a third party (Professional Operator) that operates and administers the in-building network on behalf of housing associations. Many of these agreements allow Unitymedia KabelBW to offer its digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services directly to the end customer. Professional Operators may procure the basic video signals from Unitymedia KabelBW at volume-based discounts and generally resells them to housing associations with whom the operator maintains the customer relationship. Unitymedia KabelBW has entered into agreements with Professional Operators, such as Tele Columbus Multimedia GmbH, that allow Unitymedia KabelBW to market its digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services directly to the Professional Operator’s subscriber base. Unitymedia KabelBW has entered into various long-term agreements with the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom AG (Deutsche Telekom), for the lease of cable duct space and hubs, as well as use of fiber optic transmission systems, towers and facility space. In addition, Unitymedia KabelBW purchases a portion of the electricity required for the operation of its networks through Deutsche Telekom under such agreements. Unitymedia KabelBW’s ability to offer its broadband communications services to customers is dependent on the agreements with Deutsche Telekom. These agreements are long-term and may only be terminated under certain limited exceptions. Any termination, however, would have a material adverse effect on the operations of Unitymedia KabelBW. For information on a legal action that Unitymedia KabelBW commenced against Deutsche Telekom in December 2012 regarding these agreements, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.•The Netherlands. The operations of the European Operations Division in the Netherlands are conducted by UPC Nederland under the UPC brand and, since November 12, 2014, by Ziggo under the Ziggo brand. UPC Nederland’s operations are located in six regional clusters, including the major cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Ziggo’s operations cover six regional areas, including the cities The Hague, Utrecht, Maastricht, Groningen and Tilburg. Both UPC Nederland and Ziggo (collectively, the Ziggo Group) offer video, internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services as an MVNO. Digital subscribers may subscribe to premium channels, including HBO, Film1, Sport1, Fox Sports International and the premium football league channel, Fox Sports Eredivisie, alone or in combination, for additional monthly charges. For subscribers in the UPC Nederland footprint who want access to thousands of movies and TV series, the video service MyPrime is available. VoD services, including catch-up television, are available on a subscription or a transaction basis, depending on location and the tier of digital service selected by the subscriber. VoD services are also available to CI+ users in the Ziggo footprint. A subscription-based VoD service is included in the extended digital tier for no additional charge. The transaction VoD service includes over 2,000 titles of on-demand content in the UPC Nederland footprint and over 5,000 titles in the Ziggo footprint. I-21Horizon TV is available to UPC Nederland customers as are applications on the gateway device that provide access to various internet services, such as YouTube and Facebook. At December 31, 2014, UPC Nederland had over 330,000 connected Horizon TV subscribers. We intend to expand the availability of Horizon TV to Ziggo customers during 2015. Ziggo offers its customers a cloud-based interactive television service using existing set-top boxes. By combining IP protocol with the standard set-top box, devices without built-in hardware functionality for interactivity can make use of interactive services through the cable network in the Ziggo footprint. Also available in the Ziggo footprint is a CI+ 1.3 module that enables subscribers to the digital video service to view such service without a set-top box and use a single remote control. To utilize this service, Ziggo customers must have a CI+ 1.3 enabled television and obtain the CI+ 1.3 module and smart card from Ziggo. At December 31, 2014, Ziggo had over 690,000 interactive subscribers in the Ziggo footprint. •Belgium. The operations of the European Operations Division in Belgium are conducted under the Telenet brand. At December 31, 2014, we owned 56.6% of Telenet’s outstanding ordinary shares. Telenet offers quadruple-play services consisting of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile voice and data services in Belgium, primarily to residential customers in the Flanders region and approximately one-third of the city of Brussels. In addition, pursuant to an agreement executed on June 28, 2008 (the PICs Agreement) with four associations of municipalities in Belgium (the pure intercommunales or PICs), Telenet leases the PICs broadband communications network and, accordingly, makes its services available to all of the homes passed by the cable network owned by the PICs. Telenet’s premium video channels include general entertainment, sports (including non-exclusive broadcasting rights for the domestic football league), documentary, foreign language, kids, music, adult and movies. In February 2013, Telenet launched Yelo TV. Yelo TV is an online video service that offers linear channels and VoD programming on a laptop, smartphone or tablet and in the home on the television via the customer’s set-top box. At December 31, 2014, it had over 400,000 connected Yelo TV subscribers. Telenet offers Yelo TV apps that allow Telenet’s digital video customers to remotely manage their DVR, view programs remotely (up to seven days after the original broadcast) and access VoD with a laptop, smartphone or tablet. Telenet also offers a CI+ module for an incremental monthly charge to access its encrypted digital service. Telenet has an extensive network of Community WiFi across its footprint, branded “Wi-Free”. The Community WiFi provides free WiFi access to its customers who are traveling within its footprint. Telenet has approximately 1.2 million access points to the Community WiFi as of December 31, 2014, including approximately 2,000 public hotspots covering train stations, bars, hotels and similar public places. In addition, Telenet offers, individually and as a bundle, fixed-line telephony services over its network and mobile telephony services as a full MVNO under the “Telenet Mobile” brand name. Telenet has the direct customer relationship with the analog and digital video subscribers on the PICs network. Pursuant to the PICs Agreement, Telenet has full rights to use substantially all of the PICs network under a long-term capital lease. Unless extended, the PICs Agreement will expire on September 23, 2046, and cannot be terminated earlier (except in the case of non-payment or bankruptcy of Telenet).•Switzerland and Austria. The European Operations Division also operates a cable network in Switzerland under the UPC Cablecom brand (UPC Cablecom) and cable and DSL networks in Austria under the UPC brand (UPC Austria). The DSL services are provided over an unbundled loop or, in certain cases, over a shared access network. Both UPC Cablecom and UPC Austria offer mobile voice and data services as an MVNO. Customers with the necessary equipment and who subscribe to the analog service are also able to access our basic digital service, which is unencrypted in the UPC Cablecom and UPC Austria’s footprints. Switzerland. UPC Cablecom’s operations are located in 24 of the 26 member states (Cantons) of Switzerland, including major cities such as Bern, Zürich, Lausanne and Geneva. UPC Cablecom’s basic video service (digital or analog) is available in any one of three languages (French, German or Italian). At the beginning of 2013, UPC Cablecom launched Horizon TV and at December 31, 2014, it had 223,000 connected subscribers. As a complement to its digital video service, UPC Cablecom also offers apps that allow its subscribers to remotely manage a DVR, view linear channels, replay a linear channel without recording it and access VoD with a laptop, smartphone or tablet anywhere a broadband or WiFi connection is available. Beginning in 2015, UPC Cablecom’s basic digital service will be a triple-play package consisting of video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services, plus an app to use the fixed-line telephony service on a smartphone. In addition, UPC Cablecom has launched a Community WiFi network throughout its footprint.In each of its digital cable packages, UPC Cablecom includes the functionality for transaction-based VoD service (depending on location), including catch-up television and pay-per-view services, and HD channels. Fully integrated in I-22the VoD service is the video library MyPrime, which UPC Cablecom launched in September 2014. MyPrime is included in the extended digital tiers for no additional charge. UPC Cablecom’s basic digital service is not encrypted. A CI+ module or set-top box in combination with a smart card is, however, required to view any of UPC Cablecom’s encrypted digital packages with the customer paying the incremental charge over the digital entry tier’s applicable rate. For 66% of its video subscribers, UPC Cablecom maintains billing relationships with landlords or housing associations, and provides basic video service to the tenants. The landlord or housing association administers the billing for the basic video service with their tenants and manages service terminations for their rental units.UPC Cablecom offers digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony service directly to the analog cable subscribers of those partner networks that enter into service operating contracts with UPC Cablecom. UPC Cablecom has the direct customer billing relationship with these subscribers. By permitting UPC Cablecom to offer some or all of its digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony products directly to those partner network subscribers, UPC Cablecom’s service operating contracts have expanded the addressable markets for UPC Cablecom’s digital products. In exchange for the right to provide digital products directly to the partner network subscribers, UPC Cablecom pays to the partner network a share of the revenue generated from those subscribers. UPC Cablecom also provides full or partial analog television signal delivery services, network maintenance services and engineering and construction services to its partner networks.Austria. UPC Austria’s cable operations are located in regional clusters encompassing the capital city of Vienna, the regional capitals of Graz, Innsbruck and Klagenfurt, two smaller cities and the Vorarlberg region. Three of these cities (Vienna, Wr. Neustadt and Baden), directly or indirectly, own 5% of the local operating subsidiary of UPC Austria serving the applicable city. UPC Austria’s DSL operations are available in the majority of Austria, wherever the incumbent telecommunications operator has implemented DSL technology.

Liberty Puerto Rico is exploring adding MVNO arrangements to its product line-up and other features of mobility to its service. For example, it recently launched Community WiFi in Plaza Las Americas, a major shopping center in San Juan. On December 9, 2014, an entity jointly-owned by us and Searchlight Capital entered into an agreement to acquire the parent of Puerto Rico Cable Acquisition Company, Inc., dba Choice Cable TV, the second largest cable and broadband services provider in Puerto Rico. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regularity approvals, and is expected to close in the first half of 2015. CompetitionThe markets for video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. In addition, technological advances and product innovations have increased and are likely to continue to increase the number of alternative providers available to our customers. Consequently, our businesses have faced and are expected to continue to face significant competition in these markets in the countries in which they operate and specifically, as a result of deregulation, in the European Union (EU). The percentage information in this section reflects the data for each country regardless of the extent of our footprint in such country and is as of the date of the relevant sources listed in the following sentences. The percentage information provided below for the various countries is based on information from the subscription based website DataXis for the third quarter of 2014. The competition in certain countries in which we operate is described more specifically after the respective competition overview on video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services.Video DistributionOur businesses compete directly with a wide range of providers of communication and entertainment services to consumers. Depending upon the country and market, these may include: •traditional FTA broadcast television services; •DTH satellite service providers; •other fixed-line telecommunications carriers and broadband providers, including the incumbent telephony operators offering (a) DTH satellite services, (b) IPTV over broadband internet connections using asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) or very high-speed DSL technology (VDSL) or an enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring”, (c) IPTV over fiber optic lines where the fiber is to the home, cabinet, or building or to the node networks (fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-building/-node is referred to herein as FTTx), or (d) long-term evolution wireless service, the next generation of ultra high-speed mobile data, also called “4G” (referred to herein as LTE) services; •digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasters, which transmit digital signals over the air providing a greater number of channels and better quality than traditional analog broadcasting; •other cable operators in the same communities that we serve;•over-the-top video content aggregators utilizing our or our competitors’ high-speed internet connections; •satellite master antenna television systems, commonly known as “SMATVs”, which generally serve condominiums, apartment and office complexes and residential developments; I-25•MMDS operators; and •movie theaters, video stores, video websites and home video products. Our businesses also compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and entertainment, such as online entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/concerts and sporting events. We believe that our deep-fiber access provides us with several competitive advantages in the areas served by our network. For instance, our cable network allows us to concurrently deliver internet access, together with real-time television and VoD content at higher speeds and with less data loss than comparable services of other providers. In addition, our cable infrastructure allows us to provide “triple-play” bundled services of broadband internet, television and fixed-line telephony services without relying on a third-party service provider or network. Our capacity is dimensioned to support peak consumer demand. In serving the business market, many aspects of the network can be leveraged at very low incremental cost given that business demand peaks at a time when consumer demand is low, and peaks at lower levels than consumer demand.EuropeIn the European countries in which we operate, over 90% of the households have a television. Our principal competition in the provision of video services in our European markets has historically been from traditional FTA broadcasters; DTH satellite providers in many markets, such as the U.K., Germany, Austria, Ireland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where we compete with long-established satellite platforms; incumbent telecommunications providers using fiber technology; and cable operators in various markets where portions of our systems have been overbuilt. In addition, in Belgium we are beginning to experience competition on own network as a result of the Belgium Regulatory Authorities granting third-party operators (including the incumbent telephony operator) access to cable operators’ networks. See Regulatory Matters—Belgium. Mobile broadband has gained a noticeable share of subscribers, and competition from SMATV or MMDS could also be a factor. In addition, as accessibility to video content on the internet increases, over-the-top viewing is a competitive factor. Overall, we are experiencing more and more convergence as customers are increasingly looking to receive all their media and communication services from one provider at attractive prices. As a result, our ability to offer triple-play or quadruple-play bundles is a key marketing concept to continue to attract and retain customers.Over the last several years, competition has increased significantly from both new entrants and established competitors using advanced technologies, aggressively priced services and exclusive channel offerings. Our competitors are also improving their video platforms with next generation set-top boxes. DTT is a significant part of the competitive market in Europe as a result of a number of different business models that range from full blown encrypted pay television to FTA television. Similarly, VDSL, which is either provided directly by the owner of the network or by a third party, is a significant part of the competitive environment in many of our markets as are FTTx networks. In all of our European markets, competitive video services are offered by the incumbent telecommunications operator, whose video strategies include DTH, DTT and IPTV over VDSL and FTTx networks. The ability of incumbent operators to offer the triple-play of video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services and, in some countries, a quadruple-play with mobile services, is exerting growing competitive pressure on our operations, including the pricing and bundling of our video products. The providers of DTH satellite services, particularly in the Central and Eastern European markets, are also significant competitors. In addition, over-the-top video aggregators are becoming more active in all our markets with their VoD service for television series and movies, catch-up television and linear channels from broadcasters. In some cases, these over-the-top services are provided free-of-charge, or the content library of such services are offered on an unlimited basis for a monthly fee.Our ability to continue to attract and retain customers will depend on our continued ability to acquire appealing program content and third-party programming services on acceptable financial or other terms. Some competitors, such as Swisscom AG (Swisscom) in Switzerland, have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for certain popular programs, which limits the opportunities for other providers, including our operations, to offer such programs. Other competitors also have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for programs, but our operations have access to certain of such programming through select contracts with these companies, including Sky Deutschland in Germany and Sky in the U.K. and in Ireland. If exclusive content offerings increase through other providers, programming options could be a deciding factor for subscribers on selecting a video service. Portions of our systems have been overbuilt by FTTx networks, primarily in the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia and, to a lesser extent, in Hungary, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Based on research of various telecommunication publications, including by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and internal estimates, approximately 65%, 92%, and 73% of our cable networks in the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia, respectively, have been overbuilt by FTTx networks. Also, 12% of our footprint in Hungary, 28% of our footprint in the Netherlands and 37% of our footprint in Switzerland are overbuilt by FTTx networks. Although we have extensive FTTx overbuild in Switzerland, connectivity to the FTTx network is not available at all locations. In addition, government and quasi-government entities in certain of the countries in which we I-26operate in Europe continue to invest in FTTx networks, creating another source of competition. In order to achieve download speeds of up to 100 Mbps or greater for customers, incumbent telecommunications operators are increasingly adopting VDSL with vectoring and bonding technologies as a more cost efficient solution compared to FTTx initiatives. Our Central and Eastern European markets are also experiencing significant competition from other cable operators. These cable operators have significantly overbuilt our operations in Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. Based on research of various telecommunication publications, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and internal estimates, approximately 42%, 52%, 95% and 47% of our operations in Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, respectively, are overbuilt by other cable providers. In most of our Central and Eastern European markets, we also face intense competition from DTH services. Digi TV, the DTH platform of RCS & RDS S.A. (Digi TV), a Romanian cable, telephony and internet service provider is targeting our analog cable, MMDS and DTH customers with aggressively priced DTH packages, in addition to overbuilding portions of our cable network in Hungary and Romania. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, SkyLink, the brand name of M7 Group SA, a European provider of DTH services, is a DTH competitor providing aggressively priced packages of video content. The incumbent telecommunications operator in Romania also operates a competing DTH platform. UPC DTH offers advanced services and functionality, including DVR and premium content, to most of our Central and Eastern European markets. UPC DTH’s share of the subscription-based television market is 8% for Hungary, 4% for the Czech Republic, 4% for Slovakia and, through FocusSat, 5% for Romania. In order to gain video market share, the incumbent operators and alternative service providers in a number of our larger markets have been pricing their DTT, VDSL or DTH video packages at a discount to the retail price of the comparable digital cable service and, in some cases, including DVRs as a standard feature.To meet the challenges in this competitive environment, we compete on value by offering advanced digital services, such as DVR functionality, HD, VoD, catch-up television and multi-media gateways. We seek to compete by accelerating the migration of our customers from analog to digital services, using such advanced digital features and offering attractive content packages and bundles of services at reasonable prices. HD and DVRs are an integral part of our digital services in all of our markets and VoD and catch-up television are an integral part of our digital services in most of our markets. In each of our countries we also tailor our packages to include attractive channel offerings and offer recurring discounts for bundled services and loyalty contracts. Discounts for bundled services are available in all our Europe operations. In addition, from time to time, digital channel offerings are modified by our operations to improve the quality of our programming. We also use the triple-play bundle as a means of driving video, as well as other products where convenience and price can be leveraged across the portfolio of services. In several of our markets, we have expanded our services to include mobile voice and data. We also continue to explore new technologies that will enhance our customer’s television experience. In this regard, to further enhance our digital video services, we have expanded our markets in which Horizon TV is available, including the recent launch of a cloud-based Horizon TV platform in Poland. We have also launched our on-line Horizon Go and MyPrime in a number of markets and we continue to enhance the TiVo platform in the UK and Yelo TV in Belgium. •United Kingdom. We are the largest cable television provider in the U.K. in terms of the number of video cable customers and the sole provider of video cable services in substantially all of our network area. Virgin Media’s video cable services are available to approximately 46% of the U.K. television households and it serves 14% of the total U.K. television market. Virgin Media’s digital television services compete primarily with those of Sky, which is the primary pay satellite television platform in the U.K. Sky has approximately 10.1 million subscribers in the U.K. or 37% of the total television market. Sky owns the U.K. rights to SD, HD and 3D versions, as the case may be, of various sports and movie programming content. Sky is both a principal competitor in the pay-television market and an important supplier of content to us. Virgin Media distributes several basic and premium video channels supplied by Sky. BT, which offers VDSL services throughout the U.K., is also a principal competitor as well as an important supplier of content to us. BT owns premium BT Sport channels, providing a range of sports content including football (soccer) from the English Premier League and, from the 2015/2016 football (soccer) season, exclusive rights to the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. The BT Sport channels are available over BT’s IPTV platform, Sky’s satellite system and our cable network. BT offers customers who subscribe to their broadband service free access to the SD version of the BT Sport channels. In addition, FTA DTT and internet-connected television services are a competitive factor. For example, Netflix, Google and Apple have all launched IPTV products. To compete effectively, Virgin Media promotes its ability to offer attractive triple-play bundles over its cable network and its multimedia platform TiVo. TiVo, together with Virgin Media’s VoD service and DVR functionality, allow its subscribers to personalize their programming. It also offers Virgin TV Anywhere, which allows its video subscribers to stream linear channels and access VoD services anywhere with WiFi connectivity. Recently, Virgin Media rolled back I-27prices on key bundles with a 12-month service contract, increased the number of HD channels and offers targeted bundles for sports enthusiasts. In addition, Virgin Media’s quadruple-play bundles are a key market offer. •Ireland. UPC Ireland is the sole provider of video cable services in Ireland. UPC Ireland’s video cable service is available to approximately half of the television households in Ireland and it serves 22% of the total television market. UPC Ireland’s primary competition for video customers is from Sky, which provides DTH satellite services to 39% of the television households in Ireland and launched triple-play services in 2013. Sky has announced it intends to increase its service offerings through FTTx networks in 2015. UPC Ireland also faces potential competition from a recently launched over-the-top video service by Eircom Limited and smaller video providers, including providers using FTTx networks. Although FTA DTT is available in most of Ireland, primarily through Ireland’s national public broadcaster, Raidió Teilifís Éireann, competition is limited due to its small programming offering. To enhance its competitive position, UPC Ireland offers Horizon TV. With Horizon TV, UPC Ireland realigned its bundle offers, including increasing the broadband internet speed to 200 Mbps for its mass market bundles followed by another increase to 240 Mbps in January 2015. It also increased the number of its sports channels in HD.•Germany. We are the second largest cable television provider in Germany and the largest cable television provider in the federal states of Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse based on the number of video cable subscribers. Unitymedia KabelBW’s video cable services are available to approximately 33% of the television households in Germany and it serves 17% of the total television market. Unitymedia KabelBW’s primary competition is from FTA television received via satellite. Unitymedia KabelBW also competes with the IPTV services over VDSL and FTTx and DTH of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom. Deutsche Telekom has approximately 2.4 million video subscribers in Germany, or 6% of the total television market, for primarily its IPTV services and has announced plans to cover approximately 65% of German homes with its VDSL network by 2016. We estimate it will have overbuilt nearly our entire network with VDSL by the end of 2016. Deutsche Telekom offers competitively priced triple-play bundles and promotional discounts for new customers. In addition, Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) bundles its IPTV service with its broadband offerings through Deutsche Telekom’s DSL network under a resell agreement. Deutsche Telekom and Professional Operators compete with Unitymedia KabelBW for housing association contracts. Over the last few years, Deutsche Telekom has become increasingly competitive in this market. Professional Operators typically procure the broadcast signals they distribute from Unitymedia KabelBW or from DTH providers. Certain Professional Operators may also use such opportunities to build their own distribution networks or to install their own head-ends for receiving satellite signals. Other alternative distributors of television services are an increasing threat as well. To a lesser extent, Unitymedia KabelBW competes with the services of Sky Deutschland, which offers a digital premium subscription service to households that receive their basic television service via FTA satellite, cable or other technologies. Competition with Sky Deutschland may increase following its October 2014 launch of a standalone online video streaming service. In addition, there is a risk of competition for video services from commercial broadcasters and other content providers that currently pay Unitymedia KabelBW fees for transmitting their signals, but may seek to diversify their distribution on alternative platforms such as over-the-top video through high-speed internet connections. There are several over-the-top content providers, including ProSiebenSAT.1 Media AG’s Maxdome and Netflix. To enhance its competitive position, Unitymedia KabelBW offers Horizon TV. With the launch of HorizonTV, Unitymedia KabelBW realigned its digital packages and created new bundle options. It also introduced Horizon Go giving customers remote access to 100 linear channels and VoD programming. In 2014, it also increased the number of HD channels to over 65 channels and expanded its VoD services and HD channels. The bundle options allow subscribers to select various combinations of services to meet their needs. Promotional discounts are typically available to new subscribers. •The Netherlands. We are the largest cable television provider in the Netherlands based on the number of video cable subscribers. The Ziggo Group’s video cable services are available to approximately 92% of the television households in the Netherlands and it serves 58% of the total television market. The Ziggo Group experiences most of its competition in the Netherlands from other fixed-line telecommunications carriers and broadband providers, including the incumbent telephony operator KPN. KPN offers (a) IPTV over FTTx networks, (b) IPTV through broadband internet connections using DSL, ADSL or VDSL or an enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring”, (c) DTT, and (d) LTE services. KPN provides subscription video services to 27% of the total television households in the Netherlands. Its ability to offer bundled triple-play of video, broadband internet and telephony services and a quadruple-play with mobile services, is exerting growing competitive pressure on the Ziggo Group’s operations, including the pricing and bundling of its video products. Its VDSL service includes VoD and DVR functionality, including restarting and second screen viewing. In addition, the FTTx networks of Reggefiber Group B.V. (a subsidiary of KPN) are a competitive factor in a number of cities and villages, where they have overbuilt portions of our network. Reggefiber Group B.V. continues to expand these networks within the Ziggo Group’s service area. In addition to KPN, the DTH provider CanalDigitaal, a subsidiary of M7 Group S.A., I-28is also a principal competitor. CanalDigitaal, which offers DTH and DTT services, provides subscription video services to 12% of the total television households in the Netherlands. In addition, mobile broadband has gained a noticeable share of subscribers, and as accessibility to video content on the internet increases, over-the-top viewing is becoming a competitive factor.To enhance its competitive position in the UPC Nederland footprint, UPC Nederland rolled out improvements to its multimedia platform Horizon TV, which, together with its VoD service and DVR functionality, allows the subscribers in the UPC Nederland footprint to personalize their programming. It also launched the online service Horizon Go. UPC Nederland subscribers also have the ability to watch linear and VoD programming through a second screen app and to record programs remotely. In the Ziggo footprint, Ziggo expanded its interactive video options through a CI+ 1.3 module that allows subscribers to have access to a cloud-based interactive television service without the need of a set-top box with interactive functionality. In addition, Ziggo continues to improve the quality of its programming and modify its video options by offering attractive content packages. Also, its triple-play bundle is used as a means of driving video, as well as other products, where convenience and price can be leveraged across the portfolio of services. The bundle options give subscribers the option to select various combinations of services, including high-speed internet and fixed-line telephony options, to meet their needs. Customers may also include mobile voice and data to any bundle package. •Belgium. Telenet is the sole provider of video cable services in all of its network area. Its video cable service is available to approximately 62% of the television households in Belgium and it serves approximately 44% of the total television market. It is the largest subscription television provider in Belgium based on the number of pay video subscribers. Telenet’s principal competitor is Belgacom NV/SA (Belgacom), the incumbent telecommunications operator, which has interactive digital television, VoD and HD service as part of its video offer, as well as a remote access service. Belgacom also offers double-play and triple-play and discounts on mobile services when taken with a triple-play offer. It also includes certain sports programming (primarily football (soccer) related) at no additional charge. Approximately 27% of total television households in Belgium subscribe to Belgacom’s IPTV services over its DSL and VDSL networks. Also, with the decision that Telenet and other Belgian cable operators must give alternative providers access to their cable networks, Telenet will be facing increased competition from these providers who may then be able to offer triple- and quadruple-play services as well. For more information, see Regulatory Matters—Belgium. Telenet’s multimedia platform YeloTV, together with its extensive cable network, the broad acceptance of its basic cable television services and its extensive additional features, such as HD and DVR functionality and VoD offerings, allows Telenet to compete effectively against alternative providers. In addition, Telenet offers promotional discounts and competitively priced bundles. Telenet also continues to enhance its programming. •Switzerland. We are the largest cable television provider in Switzerland based on the number of video cable subscribers and the sole provider in substantially all of our network area. UPC Cablecom’s video cable services are available to approximately 64% of the television households in Switzerland and it serves 42% of the total television market. Our main competitor is Swisscom, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which provides IPTV services over DSL and FTTx networks to approximately 33% of all television households in Switzerland. Swisscom offers VoD services, DVR functionality, and HD channels, as well as the functionality to allow remote access to its video services, and has exclusive rights to distribute certain sports programming. Swisscom’s internet speeds available in its bundled offers, include up to 100 Mbps and up to 300 Mbps in areas served by its FTTx network. Swisscom continues to aggressively expand its FTTx network to Switzerland households in our footprint as well as in our partner network footprints. It has built its fiber-to-the-home network in several cities in cooperation with municipality-owned utility companies and, where no cooperation agreement has been reached, Swisscom is building its own fiber-to-the-home network. Outside of urban areas, Swisscom has announced that it will extend its fiber-to-the-node network by introducing vectoring, which allows Swisscom to offer speeds comparable to those offered by UPC Cablecom. Due to a small program offering, competition from terrestrial television in Switzerland is limited, with DTT available primarily along the borders with France and Italy. DTH satellite services are also limited due to various legal restrictions such as construction and zoning regulations or rental agreements that prohibit or impede installation of satellite dishes. With respect to subscribers on partner networks, UPC Cablecom competes with other service providers for the contracts to serve these subscribers. To compete effectively, UPC Cablecom offers Horizon TV, which combines television, internet and fixed-line telephony on one device, giving subscribers the ability to personalize their programming. As a complement to this service, UPC Cablecom introduced the video service Horizon Go. It also offers promotional discounts and launched MyPrime in 2014 as an enhancement to its mid to high-end bundles. •Austria. In Austria, we are the largest cable television provider based on the number of video cable subscribers. UPC Austria’s video cable service is available to approximately 37% of the television households in Austria and it serves 14% of the total television market. UPC Austria’s primary competition is from FTA television received via satellite and DTT services by the public broadcaster. Competition from the VDSL services provided by the incumbent telecommunications I-29operator, Telekom Austria AG (A1) (Telekom Austria), and from DTH satellite services offered by Sky Deutschland also continue to increase. At various times, Telekom Austria offers promotional discounts for its VDSL service, which includes advanced features, such as VoD, when taken as part of either a double- or triple-play bundle. To compete effectively, UPC Austria offers its basic digital service unencrypted and realigned its bundle offers in 2014, with promotional discounts for new customers. It also launched Horizon Go and increased internet speeds for its core triple-play bundle to a top speed of up to 250 Mbps. •Central and Eastern Europe. We are the largest cable television provider in Poland based on the number of video cable subscribers. UPC Poland’s video cable services are available to approximately 20% of the television households in Poland and it serves 9% of the total television market. In providing video services, UPC Poland competes primarily with DTH service providers, including the largest DTH providers, Cyfrowy Polsat SA and NC+ platform (owned by the Vivendi Group). Cyfrowy Polsat SA and NC+ serve 27% and 16%, respectively, of the television households in Poland. The DTH service provider Orange Poland, a subsidiary of France Telecom S.A., is another significant competitor. In addition, UPC Poland competes with other cable operators with triple-play services, who have overbuilt portions of UPC Poland’s operations. One of these companies is Vectra SA, which offers aggressively priced double- and triple-play bundles. To enhance its competitive position, UPC Poland launched MyPrime as an additional service in its extended tier video services. It also realigned its video offers with additional HD channels and launched Horizon Go. Then in January 2015, after a limited offer in select markets, it launched the Horizon TV cloud platform throughout its footprint.UPC Hungary’s video cable service is available to approximately 42% of the television households in Hungary and it serves 17% of the total television market in Hungary. Our subsidiary, UPC DTH, also provides satellite services in Hungary, in competition with other DTH providers. One of these, Digi TV, is an aggressive competitor. Digi TV’s DTH services can reach all of UPC Hungary’s cable service area, as well as UPC DTH’s service area, and it has overbuilt portions of UPC Hungary’s cable service areas with its own cable network. As a DTH provider, Digi TV offers more HD channels, including key sports channels, than UPC DTH. UPC Hungary also faces competition from the incumbent telecommunications company Magyar Telekom, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. Magyar Telekom offers a VDSL service, including a VoD service, to its internet subscribers. With its ability to offer bundled triple-play and quadruple-play services, including its DTH video content, Magyar Telekom is a significant competitor. To meet such competition, UPC Hungary emphasizes its competitively priced bundles, which have been enhanced with increased broadband speeds of up to 500 Mbps with up to 120 Mbps or 240 Mbps included in its core bundle offers. In 2014, it launched the video service MyPrime and for its HBO customers the on-line streaming service HBO Go. Of the television households in Hungary, 8% subscribe to Digi TV’s DTH service, 14% subscribe to Digi TV’s cable service and 20% subscribe to Magyar Telekom’s DTH or VDSL service. UPC DTH serves 7% of the television households in Hungary with its DTH service. With the discontinuation of FTA analog services in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, DTH services have increased significantly in popularity, with M7 Group SA (SkyLink) being the main provider. This company provides DTH services to approximately 30% and 26% of the television households in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, respectively. As in Hungary, Digi TV is also an aggressive competitor in the Czech Republic and Romania. Digi TV provides DTH services to 5% and 17% of the television households in the Czech Republic and Romania, respectively. In Slovakia, we compete with the DTH service provider, Slovak Telekom a.s., a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, which offers exclusive sports channels and is expanding its DTH network to cover not only Slovakia but other Central and Eastern European countries as well. In Slovakia, it serves 20% of the television households. UPC DTH provides DTH services to 2%, 4% and 3% of the television households in the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia, respectively. To stay competitive, UPC DTH offers prepaid DTH services in the Czech Republic, as well as a prepaid product through FocusSat in Romania. Also, FocusSat has enhanced the channel offering in Romania, including the addition of non-exclusive broadcasting rights for domestic football league. In Romania, competition also comes from DTH services offered by Rom Telecom SA, the incumbent telecommunications company, with 11% of the total television households. Of the television households in the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia, 10%, 12% and 8%, respectively, subscribe to our video cable service. Our cable services are available to the television households in each of these countries as follows: 30% in the Czech Republic, 33% in Romania and 22% in Slovakia. In addition to its DTH services in Romania, Digi TV continues to overbuild portions of our cable network with its own cable network. UPC Czech competes with the incumbent telephone company’s VDSL service and several other operators that provide DTH services and a number of local ISPs that provide IPTV services over FTTx networks. Providers of IPTV services over FTTx networks can reach approximately 65% of the households passed by our cable network in the Czech Republic. Of the television households in Romania, 30% subscribe to Digi TV’s cable service. In Slovakia, a number of ISPs make video services available to a majority of the homes passed by our cable networks. In particular, Slovak Telekom and Orange Slovensko a.s., a subsidiary of France Telecom S.A., have overbuilt homes passed by our cable network with their FTTx networks and offer triple-play packages through these networks. I-30FTA broadcasters are also significant competitors in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia. Subscribers in these countries tend to be more price sensitive than in other European markets. In particular, almost 100% of the Czech Republic can receive DTT for free or a comprehensive satellite service for a minimal recurring monthly fee. To address such sensitivity and meet competition, our operations in Central and Eastern Europe offer enhanced digital services, such as HD channel offerings and, in certain markets, MyPrime, Horizon Go and expanded VoD services. In addition, all of these operations have realigned their bundle offers to include increased broadband internet speeds in their triple-play bundles ranging from up to 240 Mbps in the Czech Republic to 500 Mbps in Hungary and Romania. Promotional discounts are available, particularly on bundled options. Also, CI+ cards for DTH only products are available in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia. Latin AmericaIn Latin America, our principal competition is the provision of video services from DTH satellite providers, where we compete with established satellite platforms, as well as other pay television providers. Over-the-top viewing is also a competitive factor. To enhance the video offerings in both Chile and Puerto Rico, we are in the process of developing cloud-based, next generation user interfaces for these operations based on advanced technologies, including Horizon TV. •Chile. In Chile, we are the largest cable television provider based on number of video cable subscribers. VTR’s video cable services are available to approximately 60% of the Chilean television households and it serves 21% of the total television market in Chile. VTR competes primarily with DTH service providers in Chile, including the incumbent Chilean telecommunications operator Compañia de Telecomunicaciones de Chile SA using the brand name Movistar (Movistar), Claro Chile S.A., a subsidiary of América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. (Claro), and DirecTV Chile. Movistar offers double-play and triple-play packages using DTH for video and ADSL for internet and fixed-line telephony and offers mobile services. On a smaller scale, Movistar also offers IPTV services over FTTx networks in Chile. Claro offers triple-play packages using DTH and, in most major cities in Chile, through a hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. It also offers mobile services. To a lesser extent, VTR also competes with video services offered by or over networks of fixed-line telecommunication providers using DSL or ADSL technology. Of the Chilean television households, 12%, 7% and 9% subscribe to the DTH services of Movistar, Claro and DirecTV Chile, respectively. To enhance its competitive position, VTR offers VoD, catch-up television, DVR functionality, premium HD channels, pay-per-view, HD receivers and a variety of premium channels as value added services that can be purchased by VTR’s video cable customers. These services and its variety of bundle options, including internet and telephony, enhance VTR’s competitive position. •Puerto Rico. Liberty Puerto Rico is the largest provider of video cable services in Puerto Rico and the third largest provider of video services in Puerto Rico. Its video cable service is available to approximately 58% of the television households in Puerto Rico and it serves 18% of the total television market in Puerto Rico. Liberty Puerto Rico’s primary competition for video customers is from DTH satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network Corporation. These competitors provide DTH satellite services to 25% and 24%, respectively, of the television households in Puerto Rico. Dish Network Corporation is an aggressive competitor, offering low introductory offers, free HD channels and in its top tier packages a multi-room DVR service for free. DirecTV is also a significant competitor offering similar programming in Puerto Rico compared to Dish Network. Additionally, Claro has launched an IPTV service that may become a competitive factor. In order to compete, Liberty Puerto Rico has increased the number of its HD channels, improved the functionality of its electronic program guide, and expanded its VoD offerings. In June 2014, Liberty Puerto Rico increased its internet speeds in its bundle offers with download speeds of up to 100 Mbps in its core bundles. InternetWith respect to broadband internet services and online content, our businesses face competition in a rapidly evolving marketplace from incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications companies, mobile operators and cable-based ISPs, many of which have substantial resources. The internet services offered by these competitors include both fixed-line broadband internet services using DSL or FTTx and wireless broadband internet services, in a range of product offerings with varying speeds and pricing, as well as interactive computer-based services, data and other non-video services offered to homes and businesses. With technological developments, competition from wireless services using various advanced technologies has become significant. Recently, competitors have started offering high-speed mobile data via LTE wireless networks in certain of our markets. In addition, other wireless technologies, such as WiFi, are becoming more prevalent. We are also seeing intense competition in Europe from mobile carriers that offer mobile data cards allowing a laptop user to access the carrier’s broadband wireless data network with varying speeds and pricing. Our strategy is speed leadership, including increasing the maximum speed of our connections, offering varying tiers of service and varying prices and offering a variety of bundled product offerings and a range of value added services. In most of our operations we have launched new bundling strategies, including speeds of 120 Mbps or more at mass market price points and ultra high-I-31speed internet with speeds of generally up to 250 Mbps and in select markets up to 500 Mbps to compete with VDSL and FTTx initiatives. The focus continues to be on high-end internet products to safeguard our high-end customer base and allow us to become more aggressive at the low- and medium-end of the internet market. By fully utilizing the technical capabilities of Euro DOCSIS 3.0 technology, we can compete with local FTTx initiatives and create a competitive advantage compared to DSL infrastructures on a national level and LTE initiatives as they expand to a national level. EuropeAcross Europe, our key competition in this product market is from the offering of broadband internet products using various DSL-based technologies both by the incumbent phone companies and third parties. The introduction of cheaper and ever faster fixed-line broadband offerings is further increasing the competitive pressure in this market. Wireless broadband services, such as LTE, are also taking a foothold in a number of countries using high-speed mobile networks and high-speed downlink packet access systems. United Kingdom and Ireland. In the U.K., we have a number of significant competitors in the market for broadband internet services. Of these broadband internet providers, BT is the largest, serving 33% of the total market in the U.K. Virgin Media serves 20% of the total broadband market in the U.K. BT provides broadband internet access services over its own DSL network and is upgrading its FTTx network, which is available to approximately 70% of the U.K. population. BT Openreach, a division of BT, manages BT’s local access network and provides competitors, including Virgin Media, access to BT’s networks. BT has announced its intention to expand and accelerate FTTx deployments, which will allow its retail arm, and its wholesale customers, to offer ultra high-speed broadband services. Where fully deployed, operators will be able to offer download speeds of up to 330 Mbps. Operators such as Sky, TalkTalk Telecom Group plc and Everything Everywhere Limited (EE) deploy their own network access equipment in BT exchanges via a process known as local loop unbundling (LLU). This allows an operator to reduce the recurring operating costs charged by BT by reducing the proportion of traffic that must travel directly over BT’s network. LLU deployment requires a substantial capital investment to implement and requires a large customer base to deliver a return on investment. In addition to the competition and pricing pressure in the broadband market arising from LLU, competition from mobile broadband developments, such as LTE mobile services and WiFi services, is increasing. For example, EE has announced that its LTE coverage will reach 98% of the U.K. population by the end of 2015.To compete effectively, Virgin Media is expanding its ultra high-speed services and increasing its download speeds to up to 152 Mbps throughout it’s footprint. Virgin Media offers its internet service on a standalone basis or through bundled offerings that include video, fixed-line telephony and mobile voice and data services at attractive price points. Promotional discounts are available for new customers. In addition, Virgin Media plans to undertake a network extension program in the U.K. from 2015 through 2020. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview.Mobile providers have gained market share throughout Europe. In Ireland, mobile telephony providers Telefónica O2 Ireland Limited, Ireland 3 (a Hutchison Wampoa Ltd company) and Vodafone Ireland offer a range of mobile internet products at competitive prices. Outside of mobile internet, UPC Ireland’s most significant competitor is the fixed-line incumbent, Eircom Limited, with 41% of the broadband internet market in Ireland. In 2014, Eircom Limited increased its download speeds to up to 100 Mbps through its expanded VDSL network, which passes approximately 1.0 million homes at December 31, 2014.

It also offers promotional discounts for its mid-tier service.Central and Eastern Europe. In Central and Eastern Europe, our principal competitors are DSL operators and cable companies that are overbuilding our cable network. In Poland, our principal competitors are Orange Poland and Vectra SA, both of which offer download speeds of up to 300 Mbps in parts of UPC Poland’s footprint. In Hungary, the primary competitors are the incumbent telecommunications company, Magyar Telekom and Digi TV. In addition, in all of our Central and Eastern European operations we face increased competition from mobile broadband operators. Download speeds are also a competitive factor, with competitors enhancing their networks to increase their available download speeds. In all of our Central and Eastern European markets, we are using our ultra high-speed internet service to attract and retain customers. In addition, promotional discounts are a big part of our internet service offerings, as well as with our competitors.Latin AmericaIn Chile, VTR faces competition primarily from non-cable-based internet service providers such as Movistar and Claro. VTR is experiencing increased pricing and download speed pressure from Movistar and Claro and more effective competition from these companies with the bundle of their internet service with other services. Mobile broadband competition is significant as well. Both Movistar and Claro have launched an LTE network for high-speed mobile data. In response to the availability of mobile data in Chile, VTR has more than doubled its internet speeds with a high-speed internet offering of up to 120 Mbps. VTR’s share I-33of the broadband internet market in Chile is 38%, compared to 41% for Movistar. To compete effectively, VTR is expanding its two-way coverage and offering attractive bundling with fixed-line telephony and digital video service.Fixed-Line Telephony and Mobile ServicesThe market for fixed-line telephony services is mature. Changes in market share are driven by the combination of price and quality of services provided and the inclusion of telephony services in bundled offerings. With respect to fixed-line telephony services, our businesses compete against the incumbent telecommunications operator in each country. These operators have substantially more experience in providing fixed-line telephony and mobile services, greater resources to devote to the provision of fixed-line telephony services and long-standing customer relationships. In addition, we compete with other VoIP operators offering service across broadband lines and with mobile telephony providers. Over-the-top telephony is also becoming a competitive factor. In many countries, our businesses also face competition from other cable telephony providers, FTTx-based providers or other indirect access providers. Competition in both the residential and business fixed-line telephony markets is increasing due to market trends, the offering of carrier pre-select services, number portability, the replacement of fixed-line with mobile telephony, and the growth of VoIP services, as well as continued deregulation of telephony markets and other regulatory action, such as general price competition. Carrier pre-select allows the end user to choose the voice services of operators other than the incumbent while using the incumbent’s network. We seek to compete on pricing as well as product innovation, such as telephone apps that allow customers to make and receive calls from their fixed-line call packages on smartphones. We also offer varying plans to meet customer needs and various bundle options with our digital video and internet services. In addition, we offer mobile voice and data services in the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Chile and in select markets in Hungary. With consumers increasingly moving towards mobile services, we continue to explore opportunities to offer mobile services in our other operations and mobility applications to our other services. EuropeAcross Europe, our fixed-line and mobile telephony businesses are generally small compared to the existing business of the incumbent telephone company. The incumbent telephone companies remain our key competitors but mobile operators and other VoIP operators offering service across broadband lines are also significant competitors in these markets. Generally, we expect telephony markets to remain extremely competitive. Our fixed-line telephony strategy in Europe is focused around value leadership, and we position our services as “anytime” or “any destination”. Our portfolio of calling plans include a variety of options designed to meet the needs of our subscribers. Such options include unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. We also use our bundled offerings to help promote our telephony services. In the U.K., we compete primarily with BT in providing fixed-line telephony services to residential customers in the U.K. BT occupies an established market position as the former state provider. We also compete with other telecommunications companies that provide fixed-line telephony services directly, through LLU, or indirectly. These include TalkTalk Telecom Group plc and Sky, and mobile telephone operators such as EE and Vodafone who lease access to BT’s network. In addition, we face competition from companies offering VoIP services using the customer’s existing broadband, mobile data and WiFi connections. For our mobile service in the U.K., we also face competition from these mobile network operators as well as other MVNOs. EE became the first U.K. mobile network operator to launch LTE in October 2012, with Vodafone and others launching their LTE services in 2013. EE is the largest mobile service provider. Its LTE network reaches 80% of the U.K. population with further expansion expected in 2015. Virgin Media is responding to such competition through innovative calling plans and a WiFi application that allows customers to use their fixed-line call packages on smartphones. It offers flexible mobile service contracts that allow customers to change services monthly and has increased its WiFi access points. Virgin Media’s share of the fixed-line telephony market in the U.K. is 15%.Deutsche Telekom is the dominant fixed-line telephony provider in Germany; however, telephony services provided through alternative technologies and mobile telephony services have caused competition in the telephony market to be intense. As a result, the market for residential telephony service is price sensitive. In recent years, fixed-line phone calls have been transformed into a commodity and have become increasingly dependent on a quality broadband offering, as phone is increasingly bundled with broadband internet services. Fixed-line telephony has experienced significant price erosion over the last few years, with operators increasingly offering flat-rate products. We seek to compete based on the speed of our network connections, pricing and product innovation. We also offer varying plans to meet customer needs and various bundled service options with our digital video and broadband internet services. The market share of the fixed-line telephony market for Unitymedia KabelBW is 8%.I-34In the Netherlands, KPN is the dominant fixed-line telephony provider and expanded its mobile services with its LTE network, which is available throughout the Netherlands. All of the large multiple system operators, including the Ziggo Group, as well as ISPs, offer VoIP services. Also, Ziggo entered the mobile market as an MVNO in September 2013 and UPC Nederland began offering mobile in October 2014. To compete in this intense market, the Ziggo Group offers an app for Android and iOS users to make calls on their fixed rate plan via WiFi. The market share of the fixed-line telephony market for the Ziggo Group is 40% compared to 54% for KPN. In the mobile market, the Ziggo Group is small compared to the competition with less than 1% of the market. In Belgium, Belgacom is the dominant fixed-line telephony provider with 64% of the fixed-line telephony market. It is also a significant competitor in the mobile telephony market, with its LTE services. To gain market share, we emphasize customer service and provide innovative plans to meet the needs of our customers, such as a flat fee plan offered in our bundle options (free off-peak calls to fixed-lines in Belgium, plus 2,000 minutes for calls to mobile in Belgium, fixed and mobile in Europe, the U.S. and Canada, and fixed in Morocco and Turkey). Subscribers to our fixed-line telephony service may also make free off-peak calls to mobile lines in Belgium, Europe, the U.S. and Canada. We also offer competitively priced mobile telephony that include a wealth of voice minutes, text messages and mobile data. We compete with other fixed-line operators and with mobile operators, including Belgacom, in the provision of telephony and mobile services in Belgium. Telenet’s share of the fixed-line telephony market in Belgium is 25%. In Switzerland, we are the largest VoIP service provider, but Swisscom is the dominant fixed-line telephony service provider. Sunrise Communications AG, which offers carrier pre-select services, is also a strong competitor. Each of these competitors also operate their own mobile telephony service and include their mobile products in bundles with fixed-line services. In Austria, we serve our subscribers with VoIP over our cable network, circuit-switched telephony services and DSL technology service over LLU. To meet the competition for fixed-line services, UPC Cablecom enhanced its portfolio with attractive bundle options as well as standalone plans with free minutes either nationally or internationally and offers mobile services, including a phone app that allows smartphone users make calls on their fixed network plan. The market share of the fixed-line telephony market for UPC Cablecom is 13%. In our other European markets, the incumbent telephone companies dominate the telephony market. Most of the fixed-line competition to the incumbent telephone operators in these countries is from entities that provide carrier pre-select or wholesale line rental services. We also compete with ISPs that offer VoIP services and mobile operators. Given the increased relevance of the mobile market, we have launched mobile services as an MVNO in Austria and plan to expand these services to our other markets. To gain market share, we promote our VoIP telephony service offerings in almost all of our European markets and in some markets we have enhanced our telephony services through unlimited calling options. Latin AmericaIn Chile, VTR faces competition from the incumbent telecommunications operator, Movistar, and other telecommunications operators. Movistar has substantial experience in providing telephony services, resources to devote to the provision of telephony services and long-standing customer relationships. Competition in both the residential and business telephony markets is increasing as a result of market trends and regulatory changes affecting general price competition, number portability and the growth of VoIP services. VTR offers circuit-switched and VoIP telephony services over its cable network. VTR’s share of the residential and commercial fixed-line telephony market in Chile is 21%.In Chile, an increasing number of consumers have gravitated towards mobile service, prompting us in 2012 to add wireless plans to our services. Claro, Movistar and Entel PCS Telecommunications SA are the primary companies that offer mobile telephony in Chile. Competition in the Chilean mobile services market is increasing quickly, with new competitors providing services to customers using the MVNO model. There are five competitors that use the MVNO model: Móvil Falabella, Virgin Mobile Chile, GTD—Manquehue, Nextel and Netline. VTR offers its mobile telephony services on a standalone basis. The mobile services of VTR represent less than 1% of the mobile telephony market in Chile, of which approximately 82% comprise postpaid accounts. Of these customers 86% subscribe to at least one fixed-line VTR service. Regulatory Matters OverviewVideo distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated in each of the countries in which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the EU. I-35 Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and types of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.EuropeAustria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the U.K. are the Member States of the EU. As such, these countries are required to harmonize certain of their laws with certain EU rules. In addition, other EU rules are directly enforceable in those countries without any implementation at the national level. Certain EU rules are also applicable across the European Economic Area, whose Member States are the EU Member States (excluding Croatia) as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. In the broadcasting and communications sectors, there has been extensive EU-level legislative action. As a result, most of the markets in Europe in which our businesses operate have been significantly affected by the regulatory framework that has been developed by the EU. Regulation in Switzerland, which is not a Member State of the EU and is not part of the European Economic Area, is discussed separately below, as well as regulation in certain Member States in which we face regulatory issues that may have a material impact on our business.EU Communications RegulationThe body of EU law that deals with communications regulation consists of a variety of legal instruments and policies (collectively referred to as the Regulatory Framework). The key elements of the Regulatory Framework are various legal measures, which we refer to as the Directives, that require Member States to harmonize their laws, as well as certain regulations that have direct effect without any specific adoption at the national level. The Regulatory Framework primarily seeks open communications services markets within Europe. It harmonizes the rules within the EU for the establishment and operation of electronic communications networks, including cable television and traditional telephony networks, and the offer of electronic communications services, such as telephony, internet and, to some degree, television services. On December 18, 2009, the Official Journal of the EU published revisions to the Regulatory Framework. These revisions should have been transposed into the laws of the Member States before May 25, 2011, although in practice, this process is still ongoing in certain Member States. Despite their limited nature, certain changes to the Regulatory Framework will affect us. For example, some new powers have been given to national regulators, such as the right to mandate access to ducts without finding operators or service providers to have “Significant Market Power” (defined below). This power, in particular, could require us to open our ducts to competitors and not allow us to make use of all capacity in our ducts for our own needs, or could mean we get access to ducts of third parties instead of building our own ducts. Additionally, the revisions to the Regulatory Framework grant enhanced powers to Member States to impose transparency obligations and quality of service requirements on ISPs, which may restrict our flexibility in respect of our broadband services. Certain key provisions included in the current Regulatory Framework are set forth below. This description is not intended to be a comprehensive description of all regulation in this area. •Licensing and Exclusivity. The Regulatory Framework requires Member States to abolish exclusivities on communication networks and services in their territory and allow operators into their markets based on a simple registration. The Regulatory Framework sets forth an exhaustive list of conditions that may be imposed on communication networks and services. Possible obligations include, among other things, financial charges for universal service or for the costs of regulation, environmental requirements, data privacy and other consumer protection rules, “must carry” obligations, provision of customer information to law enforcement agencies and access obligations. •Significant Market Power. Certain of the obligations allowed by the Regulatory Framework apply only to operators or service providers with “Significant Market Power” in a relevant market. For example, the provisions of the Access Directive allow EU Member States to mandate certain access obligations only for those operators and service providers that are deemed to have Significant Market Power. For purposes of the Regulatory Framework, an operator or service provider will be deemed to have Significant Market Power where, either individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a I-36position of significant economic strength affording it the power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of competitors, customers and consumers. As part of the implementation of certain provisions of the Regulatory Framework, each Member State’s National Regulatory Authority (NRA) is required to analyze certain markets predefined by the EU Commission to determine if any operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. Until November 2007, there were 18 such markets but then the EU Commission adopted a new recommendation reducing the list of predefined markets to seven, subject to periodic review. This adjusted recommendation led to a reduction in regulation. Some NRAs, however, continue to maintain their analysis of some of the markets from the original list or perform analysis of markets not listed in the recommendation which requires the NRA to prove that additional requirements, the so called three-criteria test, are met. In October 2014, the EU adjusted the recommendation by removing the telephony markets and combining the wholesale broadband access markets. NRAs might seek to define us as having Significant Market Power in any of these predefined markets or they may define and analyze additional markets. In the event that we are found to have Significant Market Power in any particular market, an NRA could impose certain conditions on us. Under the Regulatory Framework, the EU Commission has the power to veto a finding by an NRA of Significant Market Power (or the absence thereof), which power also applies with respect to market definition, in any market, regardless of whether it is a market predefined by the EU Commission or an additional market defined by an NRA. We have been found to have Significant Market Power in certain markets in which we operate and further findings of Significant Market Power are possible. In particular, we have been found to have Significant Market Power in the termination of calls on our network. •Video Services. The regulation of distribution, but not the content, of television services to the public is harmonized by the Regulatory Framework. Member States are allowed to impose on certain operators under their jurisdiction reasonable must carry obligations for the transmission of specified radio and television broadcast channels. Such obligations are required to be based on clearly defined general interest objectives, be proportionate and transparent and be subject to periodic review. We are subject to must carry regulations in all European markets in which we operate. In some cases, these obligations go beyond what we believe is allowable under the Regulatory Framework. To date, however, the EU Commission has taken very limited steps to enforce EU law in this area, leaving intact must carry obligations in certain Member States that are in excess of what we believe to be allowed, and we do not expect the EU Commission or the Member States to curtail such obligations in the foreseeable future. •Net Neutrality/Traffic Management. Other current regulatory debates at the EU and national level include net neutrality/traffic management, as well as responsibilities for ISPs on illegal content or activities on the internet. With respect to net neutrality/traffic management, the EU Commission confirmed in April 2011 that no additional EU regulation is needed to preserve net neutrality. The EU Commission made this decision after concluding that the existing provisions of the Regulatory Framework on consumer transparency and the ability of regulators to impose a minimum quality of service on an operator should be given time to be tested by Member States. In December 2011, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC), the joint body of European telecommunications regulators, published non-binding guidelines on net neutrality and transparency. BEREC believes that transparency and the ability for end-users to easily switch providers is vital and recommends that operators should provide clear end-user information about service limitations and actual speeds. While the EU has not imposed net neutrality regulation to date, it does require operators to provide clear and transparent information to customers on traffic management practices and service quality. In addition, new measures have been proposed as part of the EU’s Telecoms Single Market proposal, which would prohibit blocking and throttling of internet traffic, with the exception of congestion management. The proposals also support development of specialized, managed services delivering enhanced Quality of Service levels by ISPs, in addition to the continued delivery of best-effort internet services for all. There is significant pressure, however, to restrict the use of specialized services, which could compromise our ability to manage the content streams on our network. Negotiations between Member States are in their infancy and we currently expect these negotiations to be completed in the first half of 2015. The final outcome of this debate and its impact on our businesses is difficult to predict. On September 11, 2013, the EU Commission proposed a partial reform to the Regulatory Framework in its proposed regulation on the European single market for electronic communications. Under EU law, a regulation, unlike a Directive, is required to be implemented into national law without interpretation by the respective national government. This proposal is a substantial reform to the 2009 Regulatory Framework, notably in how regulatory powers for licensing, spectrum and consumer protection are divided between NRAs, BEREC and the EU Commission. The proposal does not, however, modify the Regulatory Framework for mandating access obligations on operators with Significant Market Power. With respect to broadband services, the proposal permits ISPs to charge content or application service providers for carriage in return for new prohibitions to the use of traffic management I-37to block, slow down or degrade services or applications. There are also modifications to the rules on consumer protection that extend the circumstances under which subscribers can terminate their contracts without cost, which may restrict our flexibility in respect of our bundled service offerings. The proposed regulation is subject to approval by the European Parliament and by Member States in the European Council. While most of the proposals have not obtained the support of Member States in Council, as of January 2015, Member States have indicated they are willing to reach an agreement on reform of the roaming proposals and on a pan-European wide approach to net neutrality. A formal position among the 28 Member States may be reached by the end of February 2015, after which Member States in Council must negotiate their final position with the European Parliament before the measures can become EU law. Final adoption of these measures, if any, is not likely to occur before the second half of 2015.EU Broadcasting LawAlthough the distribution of video channels by a cable operator is within the scope of the Regulatory Framework, the activities of a broadcaster are harmonized by other elements of EU law, in particular the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS). Generally, broadcasts originating in and intended for reception within an EU Member State must respect the laws of that Member State. Pursuant to AVMS, however, EU Member States are required to allow broadcast signals of broadcasters established in another EU Member State to be freely transmitted within their territory so long as the broadcaster complies with the law of their home state. This is referred to as the country of origin principle. Under AVMS, the country of origin principle applies also to non-linear services, such as VoD. Accordingly, we should be able, if we so elect, to offer our own VoD services across the European Economic Area based on the regulation of the country of origin. As a result, we could structure our business to have a single regulatory regime for all of our VoD services offered in Europe. In addition, when we offer third party VoD services on our network, it should be the business of the third party, in its capacity as provider of the services, and not us as the local distributor, that is regulated in respect of these services. Although Member States were obligated to transpose the requirements of AVMS into national law, and this has generally been completed, the practical effect is still not clear. Uncertainty still remains about the proper treatment of VoD from a practical perspective. Thus, there can be no assurance that the requirements on VoD will, in fact, operate in the manner described above in any individual Member State. As a result, we may face inconsistent and uncertain regulation of our VoD service in Europe. AVMS also establishes quotas for the transmission of European-produced programming and programs made by European producers who are independent of broadcasters. Other European Level RegulationIn addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, our European operating companies must comply with both specific and general legislation concerning, among other matters, data protection, data retention and electronic commerce. Many of these regimes are, or will be, reviewed at the EU level. Our European operating companies are also subject to both national and European level regulations on competition and on consumer protection, which are broadly harmonized at the EU level. For example, while our operating companies may offer their services in bundled packages in European markets, they are sometimes not permitted to make a subscription to one service, such as cable television, conditional upon a subscription to another service, such as telephony. They may also face restrictions on the degree to which they may discount certain products included in the bundled packages. The EU Commission is imposing more mandatory requirements and encouraging voluntary solutions regarding energy consumption of the telecommunications equipment we provide our customers. We have been participating in discussions and studies regarding energy consumption with the EU Commission and with experts working on their behalf. In addition, we are working with suppliers of our digital set-top boxes to lower power consumption, as well as looking at possibilities through software to lower the power consumption of the existing fleet of digital set-top boxes. We also worked with a large group of companies to create a voluntary agreement on set-top box power consumption as an alternative to regulation. The EU Commission formally recognized this voluntary agreement as a valid alternative to regulation on November 22, 2012. Nevertheless, legislation in this area may be adopted that could adversely affect the cost and/or the functionality of equipment we deploy in customer homes. Pursuant to an EU regulation on standby power effective January 7, 2010 (the Standby Regulation), many devices are required to have either a low power standby mode or off mode unless it is inappropriate to have either such mode on the device. For this purpose, our set-top boxes and certain other equipment are equipped with an off switch. Beginning in January 2013, the Standby Regulation imposed further requirements on power management on certain devices we purchase and/or develop, which devices, namely the Horizon TV set-top box and any future set-top boxes, must comply with such requirements, unless it can be argued such further requirements are inappropriate. These additional requirements have necessitated additional software developments for our equipment and reduce the functionality of our equipment assuming the equipment’s default setting is maintained. I-38Furthermore in August 2013, the EU Commission issued an amendment to the Standby Regulation called Networked Standby (No 801/2013), which became effective as of January 1, 2015, with the aim of regulating, among others, the maximum power consumption of networked consumer equipment while in the so-called Networked Standby mode. As is the case with the Standby Regulation, these additional requirements may have an impact on our costs and the customer experience.As part of the EU’s Radio Spectrum Policy Program, spectrum made available through the switch off of analog television has been approved for mobile broadband use beginning January 1, 2013. This spectrum, known as the “digital dividend”, is in the 700 - 862 MHz band. The terms under which this spectrum will become available will vary among the European countries in which we operate. Certain uses of this spectrum may interfere with services carried on our cable networks. If this occurs, we may need to: (1) avoid using certain frequencies on our cable networks for certain or all of our services, (2) make some changes to our networks, or (3) change the equipment which we deploy. In approving mobile broadband, however, the Radio Spectrum Policy Program states that the new mobile services must co-exist with existing services, such as cable and DTT, to avoid harmful interference. As a result, we are in on-going discussions with relevant Member States and the EU Commission to be included in LTE mobile trials in order to develop mitigation techniques and to engage NRAs to launch regulatory dialogs with equipment manufacturers and mobile operators to develop co-existing networks. We have also requested Member States and the EU Commission to prepare comprehensive national impact assessments when spectrum conditions are changed to ensure that the costs to prevent interference between the various services are balanced. United KingdomIn the U.K., the revised Regulatory Framework is implemented through (1) the Communications Act 2003, which regulates all forms of communications technology, whether used for telecommunications or broadcasting, and (2) the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006, which regulates radio communications in the U.K. (including with respect to the spectrum, licensing arrangements, usage conditions and charges, license bidding and trading and enforcement and penalties). The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, as amended, implemented EU Directive 2002/58, which regulates the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector. Virgin Media is also subject to regulation under the U.K. Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 and other U.K. statutes and subordinate legislation, including the Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise Act 2002. On-demand programming is regulated by the Authority for Television On-Demand under a co-regulatory regime with the U.K. Office of Communications (Ofcom). The regulatory regime for on-demand programming is derived from the EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive.Ofcom is the key regulatory authority for the communications sector in which Virgin Media operates. It is responsible for furthering the interests of consumers by promoting competition. The Competition and Markets Authority also has jurisdiction with respect to competition matters. (Pursuant to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013, effective April 1, 2014, the competition functions of the U.K. Office of Fair Trading, together with those of the U.K. Competition Commission, were transferred to a new U.K. competition authority, the Competition and Markets Authority.) The Competition and Markets Authority’s primary duty is to promote competition, both within and outside the U.K., for the benefit of consumers. Broadband Expansion. The U.K. government has attempted to drive the deployment of super-fast broadband and the provision of basic broadband to 95% of the population of the U.K. by 2017 using money from the publicly funded BBC Licence Fee, under-spend from the Analogue TV Switch-Off Project and other sources of public investment to stimulate private investment. Two key projects are under way: (1) the Broadband Delivery Programme, which is focused on delivering broadband to areas that the market will not serve of its own accord (mainly rural areas); and (2) the Urban Broadband Fund, which is aimed at establishing “super connected” cities with internet capabilities of between 80 Mbps to 100 Mbps and comprehensive mobile broadband coverage. In 2013, the U.K. government announced the Superfast Extension Programme, which is designed to support the roll-out of broadband with download speeds of 30 Mbps or higher to 99% of the population of the U.K. by 2018. Virgin Media lodged a formal challenge against the EU Commission's decision to approve a project involving the deployment of a state-subsidized broadband network in the city of Birmingham in 2012. Based on assurances received from the U.K. government that no Urban Broadband Fund monies would be used to deploy telecommunications infrastructure in the U.K., such that Birmingham could not implement the network for which it had received EU Commission approval, Virgin Media requested and was granted a stay in proceedings until March 31, 2015. As an alternative, the U.K. government launched a retail connectivity voucher scheme, in which Virgin Media participates. Television and VoD Services. Sky has market power in the wholesale supply of certain premium sports channels. As a result, Ofcom imposed a Wholesale Must Offer (WMO) regime for regulating the terms of the wholesale supply of Sky Sports 1 and 2 SD and HD. A number of parties, including Virgin Media, appealed this decision. In August 2012, the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) overturned Ofcom’s decision, ruling that the competition concerns on which Ofcom based its decision were unfounded. BT appealed certain aspects of the CAT’s judgment to the Court of Appeal. I-39In February 2014, the Court of Appeal upheld BT’s appeal. The matter has been referred back to the CAT for further consideration, and the Supreme Court has denied Sky the opportunity to appeal. The WMO requirement continues in the meantime and BT has secured an extension to cover distribution over the YouView platform. On December 19, 2014, Ofcom launched a consultation to review the WMO remedy and consider whether it remains an appropriate remedy.In November 2014, Ofcom opened an investigation into the arrangements by which the FA Premier League collectively sells the live U.K. audio-visual media rights to Premier League football (soccer) matches. Ofcom’s investigation is on the basis that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that these arrangements appreciably restrict or distort competition in breach of the prohibition in Chapter I of the Act and/ or Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This investigation is underway.Broadband Services. Ofcom has recently finalized its triennial review of the Fixed Access markets (including Wholesale Local Access incorporating physical or passive network access via methods such as LLU and duct access) and Wholesale Broadband Access market (virtual or active network access via methods such as provision of wholesale managed service products). There has been no substantive change in its approach to regulation from the previous review period. Therefore, we do not anticipate significant consequences for Virgin Media’s operations.BT has again been found to have Significant Market Power in the Wholesale Local Access market and at least one sub-national area of the Wholesale Broadband Access market and is required to provide certain products and services on regulated terms, including providing access to its ducts and poles infrastructure. Ofcom is proposing to impose new guidance regulating BT’s fiber margin. Current proposals indicate BT will not have to undertake a major repricing realignment in order to comply with this additional obligation. Mobile Service. As an MVNO, Virgin Media is subject to EU regulations relating to retail prices for roaming services. These regulations set limits on certain wholesale and retail tariffs for international mobile voice roaming, SMS tariffs and data roaming within the EU, provides for greater levels of transparency of retail pricing information, imposes measures to guard against bill shock in respect of data roaming and sets maximum roaming rates within the EU. A new measure, effective July 1, 2014, allows consumers to select an alternative provider for their EU roaming services. The measure is intended to increase competition for the provision of roaming services. Mobile termination charges applied by mobile network operators are regulated by Ofcom under a Significant Market Power charge control condition. Under Virgin Media’s MVNO agreement, these changes in mobile termination charges are passed on to Virgin Media, which has experienced a reduction in revenue from such charges, although with some off-setting reductions in cost. Ofcom is in the process of reviewing mobile termination charges for the period of 2015-2018, and has proposed that rates be reduced to approximately half of their current levels by the end of this period.GermanyGermany has incorporated the EU laws into national laws although under the German legal system competency is split between the Federal State (telecommunication law) and the German federal states (Bundesländer) (media law). The German Telecommunications Act broadly implemented the Regulatory Framework and covers the distribution of any signal by telecommunications networks encompassing television signals, internet data and telephony. The 2009 revisions to the Regulatory Framework by the EU were implemented by Germany in May 2012. The German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) is responsible inter alia for the regulation of the German telecommunications market. The Federal Cartel Office (FCO), the national competition authority (Bundeskartellamt), plays an important role with respect to infrastructure and media regulation. The FCO has powers to address competition issues in all markets, although in some cases, competition issues will be addressed by the German Federal Network Agency. Regulation of the media falls within the authority of the German federal states (Bundesländer). The media laws of all 16 federal states have been partially harmonized by the State Broadcasting Treaty (Rundfunkstaatsvertrag). The State Broadcasting Treaty establishes the main framework of the German regulation of broadcast. Nearly every German state has established its own independent regulatory body, the state media authority (Landesmedienanstalt) for the regulation of the private broadcasting sector. The state media authorities are primarily responsible for licensing and supervision of commercial broadcasters and the allocation of transmission capacities for radio and television channels. They also have authority with respect to the regulation of carriage fees, conditional access systems, interfaces, the bundling of programs, and price regulation. The allocation and use of analog cable transmission capacities for both radio and television channels in Germany is governed by the must carry rules of the respective German federal states. The allocation of digital transmission capacities for digital television and radio channels is primarily governed by the must carry rules of the State Broadcasting Treaty. The media law in the states of Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse require Unitymedia KabelBW to carry at least 13, 24 and 28 analog channels, respectively, and also limits Unitymedia KabelBW’s ability to convert these analog cable channels into digital channels. I-40The operation of conditional access systems for television services is governed by both the State Broadcasting Treaty and the German Telecommunications Act. Generally, operators must not unfairly obstruct or discriminate against broadcasters and other content providers through conditional access systems. On December 15, 2011, the FCO approved our acquisition of the German cable network KBW (the KBW Acquisition), subject to our agreement with the following conditions:•Unitymedia KabelBW committed to the distribution of basic digital television channels (as opposed to channels marketed in premium subscription packages) on its entire network in unencrypted form. This commitment, with which we have complied, generally covers free-to-air television channels in SD and HD and is consistent with the practice that had been adopted by KBW prior to the KBW Acquisition. If, however, FTA television broadcasters request their HD content to be distributed in an encrypted HD package, the encryption of FTA HD channels is still possible. In addition, we made a commitment that, through December 31, 2016, the annual carriage fees Unitymedia KabelBW receives for each such FTA television channel distributed in digital or simulcast in digital and analog would not exceed a specified annual amount, determined by applying the applicable rate card systems of Unitymedia KabelBW as of January 1, 2012.•Effective January 1, 2012, Unitymedia KabelBW waived its exclusivity rights in access agreements with housing associations with respect to the usage of infrastructures other than its in-building distribution networks to provide television, broadband internet or telephony services within the building.•Effective January 1, 2012, upon expiration of the minimum term of an access agreement with a housing association, Unitymedia KabelBW transferred the ownership rights to the in-building distribution network to the building owner or other party granting access. In addition, Unitymedia KabelBW waived its right to remove its in-building distribution networks.•A special early termination right was granted with respect to certain of Unitymedia KabelBW’s existing access agreements (the Remedy HA Agreements) with the largest housing associations that cover more than 800 dwelling units and which had a remaining term of more than three years as of December 15, 2011. The total number of dwelling units covered by the Remedy HA Agreements was approximately 340,000 as of December 15, 2011. The special termination right may be exercised on or before September 30 of each calendar year up to the expiration of the current contract term, with termination effective as of January 1 or July 1 of the following year. If the special termination right is exercised, compensation will be paid to partially reimburse Unitymedia KabelBW for its unamortized investments in modernizing the in-building network based on an agreed formula. To the extent Unitymedia KabelBW is successful in obtaining renewals of the Remedy HA Agreements, we expect that these renewed contracts will contain pricing and other provisions that are somewhat less favorable to Unitymedia KabelBW than those in previous agreements. At December 31, 2014, approximately 10% of the dwelling units covered by the Remedy HA Agreements remain subject to the special termination right.In January 2012, two of our competitors (the Appellants), including the incumbent telecommunications operator, each filed an appeal (the FCO Appeals) against the FCO regarding its decision to approve the KBW Acquisition. On August 14, 2013, the Düsseldorf Court of Appeal issued a ruling that set aside the FCO’s clearance decision. Although the Düsseldorf Court of Appeal did not grant the right to appeal against its ruling to the Federal Supreme Court, on September 16, 2013, we filed a formal request to appeal to the Federal Court of Justice seeking permission to appeal the Düsseldorf Court of Appeal’s decision and our reasoned submission was filed on December 16, 2013. During the first quarter of 2014, interested third parties commented on our submission. The Düsseldorf Court of Appeal’s ruling is not legally binding until all appeals have been rejected. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we, together with our German subsidiaries, entered into agreements with the Appellants, pursuant to which the Appellants withdrew the FCO Appeals and, on January 21, 2015, the FCO consented to the withdrawal. If the Federal Court of Justice terminates the proceedings, which we expect to occur during the first quarter of 2015, the FCO’s clearance decision with respect to our KBW Acquisition will become final (without any additional review or conditions). Upon termination of the proceedings, we have agreed to pay the Appellants an aggregate amount of €183.5 million ($222.0 million). The NetherlandsThe Netherlands’ electronic communications law broadly implements the Regulatory Framework. According to this electronic communications law, Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM), the Netherlands NRA, was required to perform a market analysis to determine which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In December 2011, ACM completed a market assessment of the television market in the Netherlands, concluding that there were no grounds for regulation of that market. As a result, no new regulations relating to the television market may be proposed without a new analysis. In particular, ACM I-41rejected previously filed requests from a number of providers to perform a new market analysis of the television market and this decision was upheld by the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court on November 5, 2012.In May 2012, the Dutch Parliament adopted laws that provide, among other matters, the power to ACM to impose an obligation for the mandatory resale of television services and to the Commissariaat voor de Media to supervise such resale obligation. These laws became effective on January 1, 2013, notwithstanding the above-described November 5, 2012 decision of the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court. On January 29, 2014, a Dutch civil court, in a proceeding initiated by UPC Nederland, declared the resale obligation laws non-binding because they infringe EU law. The Dutch Government did not appeal the January 2014 decision, and the resale obligation laws were formally withdrawn on November 26, 2014. We cannot predict whether the Dutch government will seek to enact new resale obligation regulations, whether our operations may otherwise (on the basis of a market analysis by ACM) become subject to resale obligation regulation, or the effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position from any implementation of such a resale regime.On August 5, 2013, ACM published its latest market analysis decision on call termination, which combines both the fixed termination market and the mobile termination market. The new tariffs became effective September 1, 2013, and apply for a three year period. The decision was appealed by various operators, including us, and on August 27, 2013, the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court decided in a preliminary decision that the decrease of cap charges should be less steep than ACM had initially determined. These revised tariffs apply until the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court arrives at a final decision in the appeal proceedings on the merits. This final decision is not expected before the end of 2015 because the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court ruled on October 15, 2014, that it wishes to pose prejudicial questions to the European Court of Justice.On January 1, 2014, the revised must carry obligations became effective. The revised must carry obligations do not only apply to cable operators as was previously the case, but will apply to all providers of analog and digital program packages based on the principle of technology neutrality. Providers of digital program packages with 100,000 or more subscribers are subject to the obligation to provide at least 30 television channels, including as a must carry obligation six public television broadcasting channels, a limited amount of regional and local television broadcasting channels and a number of digital radio broadcasting channels. In addition, all providers of analog program packages with 100,000 or more subscribers must include at least 15 television channels, including as a must carry obligation five public broadcasting channels, a limited amount of regional and local television broadcasting channels and some analog radio broadcasting channels. The Dutch Media Authority can grant a (conditional) exemption from the obligation if the must carry obligations listed above give rise to disproportionate costs for the network operator, an impediment to innovation or other unreasonable outcomes. There is no regulated financing mechanism in place between network operators and broadcasters. Commercial and public program providers must negotiate with network operators regarding transmission fees. In connection with the Ziggo Acquisition, we obtained regulatory clearance from the EU Commission on October 10, 2014, which clearance was subject to the following commitments:•our commitment to sell Film1 channel to a third party and to carry Film1 on our network in the Netherlands for a period of three years; and•our commitment for a period of eight years with respect to our Ziggo Group network (1) not to enforce certain clauses currently contained in carriage agreements with broadcasters that restrict the ability of broadcasters to offer their channels and content via third party over-the-top services, (2) not to enter into carriage agreements containing such clauses and (3) to maintain adequate interconnection capacity through at least three uncongested routes into our network, at least one of which must be with a large transit provider. Following the EU Commission’s clearance of the Ziggo Acquisition, on October 31, 2014, ACM published as part of the fourth round of market analysis a draft of market analysis decision on LLU. In this draft decision, ACM found that there is a risk of joint dominance of KPN and us in the related retail broadband market, which would be remedied on the wholesale market for LLU where ACM found a risk of single dominance of KPN. This draft decision was subject to national consultation until December 12, 2014, followed by notification to the EU Commission. The final decision is expected to be published by ACM in the Spring of 2015.I-42Belgium Belgium has broadly transposed the Regulatory Framework into law. According to the electronic communications law of June 13, 2005, the Belgisch Instituut voor Post en Telecommunicate (the BIPT), the Belgian NRA, should perform the market analysis to determine which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In addition, the Federal Parliament prepared legislation to transpose the 2009 revisions to the Regulatory Framework, which became effective as of August 4, 2012. Telenet has been declared an operator with Significant Market Power on the market for call termination on an individual fixed public telephone network. As of April 1, 2012, reciprocal termination rates have been imposed, which results in Telenet charging the interconnection rate of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Belgacom. Although no determination has been made on whether Telenet has Significant Market Power on the market for call termination on individual mobile networks, its rates will be affected by rate limitations implemented by BIPT. In June 2010, BIPT imposed a steep rate reduction that resulted in (1) an initial 45% decline effective August 1, 2010, over the then average rate and (2) a further decline in January 2013 that was approximately 79% less than the average rate implemented on August 1, 2010. As of January 1, 2013, mobile termination rates have been set by BIPT at 1.08 euro cents per minute, and to date, 2015 rates have not been set.In December 2010, the BIPT and the regional regulators for the media sectors (together, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities) published their respective draft decisions reflecting the results of their joint analysis of the broadcasting market in Belgium. After a public consultation, the draft decisions were submitted to the EU Commission. The EU Commission issued a notice on the draft decision that criticized the analysis of the broadcasting markets on several grounds, including the fact that the Belgium Regulatory Authorities failed to analyze upstream wholesale markets. It also expressed doubts as to the necessity and proportionality of the various remedies.The Belgium Regulatory Authorities adopted a final decision on July 1, 2011 (the July 2011 Decision) with some minor revisions. The regulatory obligations imposed by the July 2011 Decision include (1) an obligation to make a resale offer at “retail minus’’ of the cable analog package available to third party operators (including Belgacom), (2) an obligation to grant third-party operators (except Belgacom) access to digital television platforms (including the basic digital video package) at “retail minus”, and (3) an obligation to make a resale offer at “retail minus’’ of broadband internet access available to beneficiaries of the digital television access obligation that wish to offer bundles of digital video and broadband internet services to their customers (except Belgacom). Telenet submitted draft reference offers regarding the obligations described above in February 2012, in response to which the Belgium Regulatory Authorities subsequently made their observations, launched a national consultation process and consulted with the EU Commission. Although the EU Commission expressed doubts regarding the analog resale offers on August 8, 2013, the EU Commission did not object to the reference offers. The Belgium Regulatory Authorities published the final decision on September 9, 2013. The regulated wholesale services had to be available approximately six months after a third-party operator filed a letter of intent and paid an advance payment to Telenet. On December 27, 2013, wireless operator Mobistar SA (Mobistar) submitted a letter of intent and paid the advance payment on January 10, 2014. Telenet has implemented the access obligations as described in its reference offers and, as of June 23, 2014, access to the Telenet network had become operational and can be applied by Mobistar. In addition, as a result of the November 2014 decision by the Brussels Court of Appeal described below, on November 14, 2014, Belgacom submitted a request to Telenet to commence access negotiations.On April 2, 2013, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities issued a draft decision regarding the “retail-minus” tariffs of minus 35% for basic television (basic analog and digital video package) and minus 30% for the bundle of basic television and broadband internet services. A “retail-minus” method of pricing involves a wholesale tariff calculated as the retail price for the offered service by Telenet, excluding value-added taxes and copyrights, and further deducting the retail costs avoided by offering the wholesale service (such as costs for billing, franchise, consumer service, marketing, and sales). On October 4, 2013, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities submitted a draft quantitative decision to the EU Commission in which they changed the “retail-minus” tariffs to minus 30% for basic television (basic analog and digital video package) and to minus 23% for the bundle of basic television and broadband internet services. Even though the EU Commission made a number of comments regarding the appropriateness of certain assumptions in the proposed costing methodology, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities adopted such retail-minus tariffs on December 11, 2013.Telenet filed an appeal against the July 2011 Decision with the Brussels Court of Appeal. In November 2014, the Brussels Court of Appeal rejected Telenet’s appeal and accepted Belgacom’s claim that it should have access to Telenet’s digital television platform and resale of broadband internet access in a bundle with digital video. Telenet is currently considering the possibility of filing an appeal against this decision with the Belgian Supreme Court. Telenet also filed an appeal with the Brussels Court of Appeal against the decision regarding the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the reference offers. Wireless operator Mobistar I-43also filed an appeal against the decision regarding the quantitative aspects of the reference offers. A decision with respect to these appeals is not expected before the end of 2015. There can be no certainty that Telenet’s appeals will be successful. The July 2011 Decision aims to, and in its application may, strengthen Telenet’s competitors by granting them resale access to Telenet’s network to offer competing products and services. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (1) limit the bandwidth available to Telenet to provide new or expanded products and services to the customers served by its network and (2) adversely impact Telenet’s ability to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on the extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access ultimately afforded to Telenet’s network and other competitive factors or market developments. SwitzerlandSwitzerland has a regulatory system which partially reflects the principles of the EU, but otherwise is distinct from the European regulatory system of telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act (Fernmeldegesetz) regulates, in general, the transmission of information, including the transmission of radio and television signals. Most aspects of the distribution of radio and television, however, are regulated under the Radio and Television Act (Radio und Fernsehgesetz). In addition, the Competition Act and the Act on Price Surveillance are potentially relevant to our business. With respect to energy consumption of electronic home devices, the Energy Act and the revised Energy Ordinance have been applicable since January 2010 to television set-top boxes as described below. Under the Telecommunications Act, any provider of telecommunications services needs to register with the Federal Office of Communications. Dominant providers have to grant access to third parties, including LLU access. But this access regulation is restricted to the copper wire network of the incumbent, Swisscom. Therefore, such unbundling obligations do not apply to UPC Cablecom and other cable operators. Also, any dominant provider has to grant access to its ducts, subject to sufficient capacity being available in the relevant duct. At this time, only Swisscom has been determined to be dominant in this regard. All operators are obliged to provide interconnection and have to ensure interoperability of services. The Federal Council has suggested that the current Telecommunications Act be revised in two steps. First, the Federal Council plans to introduce measures to allow for easier access to the incumbent’s network, better consumer protection and some measures to decrease roaming fees. Second, the Federal Council plans to introduce an efficient access regime to the Swisscom network by introducing ex officio rights for the Federal Communications Commission and an ex-ante regime, regulate the roaming prices and improve the consumer and youth protection rules. This second step is not expected to start before 2018. In addition, it is expected that the conditions for a national broadband rollout will be improved by introducing access obligations to the ducts of local utilities. Under the Radio and Television Act and the corresponding ordinance, cable network operators are obliged to distribute certain programs that contribute in a particular manner to media diversity. The Federal Government and the Federal Office of Communications can select up to 25 programs that have to be distributed in analog without the cable operator being entitled to compensation. A new Radio and Television ordinance became effective August 1, 2012, which allows cable operators to decrease the number of obligatory channels to be broadcasted in analog. A departmental ordinance was published which eliminates this regime for all foreign broadcasters as of June 1, 2013, and all other such regulation as of January 1, 2015. Additionally, there is no legal obligation to broadcast digital and analog in parallel as long as the digital offer is comparable to analog and does not force customers to incur additional costs.UPC Cablecom’s retail customer prices are subject to review by the Swiss Price Regulator. In October 2012, UPC Cablecom announced an agreement with the Swiss Price Regulator pursuant to which UPC Cablecom will make certain changes to its service offerings in exchange for progressive increases in the price of its basic cable connection. In this regard, (1) effective November 1, 2012, UPC Cablecom began offering a basic tier of digital television channels on an unencrypted basis in its footprint and (2) effective January 3, 2013, for video subscribers who pay the required upfront activation fee, UPC Cablecom has made available, at no additional monthly charge, a 2 Mbps internet connection, which was an increase from the previously-offered 300 Kbps internet connection. In addition, the monthly price for a cable connection increased by CHF 0.90 ($0.91) effective January 1, 2013 and a further increase of CHF 0.60 ($0.60) took effect on January 1, 2014.Effective October 1, 2014, the Federal Council proposed a new regulation imposing power thresholds for set-top boxes. There are some exemptions and transition periods which apply in the short term to the set-top boxes we import into Switzerland. The Swiss regulation may not be in line with EU regulation, and it may be reconsidered as Switzerland tries to align itself with EU norms. If, however, such regulation remains in force, it may have an adverse effect on the business of UPC Cablecom as UPC Cablecom may face restrictions regarding the import of set-top boxes.I-44ChileVTR is subject to regulation and enforcement by various governmental entities in Chile including the Chilean Antitrust Authority, the Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications (the Ministry) through the Chilean Undersecretary of Telecommunications (SubTel), the National Television Council (CNTV) and Chile’s National Consumer Service (Sernac).In addition to the specific regulations described below, VTR is subject to certain regulatory conditions which were imposed by the Chilean Antitrust Authority in connection with VTR’s combination with Metrópolis Intercom SA in April 2005. These conditions are indefinite and include, among others, (1) prohibiting VTR and its control group from participating, directly or indirectly through a related person, in Chilean satellite or microwave television businesses, (2) prohibiting VTR from obtaining exclusive broadcast rights, except for specific events, and (3) requiring VTR to offer its broadband capacity for resale of internet services on a wholesale basis.VideoThe provision of pay television services requires a permit issued by the Ministry. Cable pay television permits are granted for an indefinite term and are non-exclusive, and, because such permits do not involve radioelectric spectrum, they are granted without ongoing duties or royalties. VTR has permits to provide cable pay television services in the major cities, including Santiago, and in most of the medium-sized markets in Chile. Cable television service providers in Chile are free to define the channels and content included in their services and are not required to carry any specific programming, except as described below. However, CNTV may impose sanctions on providers who are found to have run programming containing excessive violence, pornography or other objectionable content. Pay television operators are directly responsible for violation of such prohibitions. Additionally, the Television Act requires pay television operators to offer a certain quota of cultural content and to distribute public interest campaigns.The Television Act has been recently amended to establish a retransmission consent regime between broadcast television concessionaires and pay television operators. This regime provides that once a broadcast operator achieves digital coverage of 85% of the population within its concession areas, the broadcast operator may require that pay television operators enter into an agreement for the retransmission of its digital signal. In addition, the Television Act requires that the technical or commercial conditions imposed by broadcast operators not discriminate among pay television operators. Also, the Television Act establishes a must carry regime requiring pay television operators to distribute up to four local broadcast television channels in each operating area. The channels that must be carried by any particular pay television operator are to be selected by CNTV.The Chilean Consumer’s Rights Protection Law contains provisions that have been interpreted by Sernac to require that any increase in rates exceeding inflation must be previously accepted and agreed to by subscribers. Although VTR disagrees with this interpretation, in July 2012, VTR reached an agreement with Sernac, which permits VTR to make adjustments to its published rates twice per year to adjust for inflation. In addition, VTR may once a year propose to its existing subscribers additional changes to their rates. If a subscriber does not accept these proposed rate changes, the subscriber is permitted to terminate its subscription contract. In addition, the agreement with Sernac establishes the criteria upon which VTR may modify its channel line-up without the consent of subscribers. Internet In August 2010, a law on internet neutrality was passed, which prohibits “arbitrary blockings” of legal content, applications or services and the provision of differentiated service conditions according to the origin or ownership of the content or service provided through the internet. Additionally, the law authorizes ISPs to take measures to ensure the privacy of their users and provide virus protection and safety processes over their network, as long as these measures do not infringe antitrust laws. Additional measures were subsequently implemented, including obligations related to consumer information, traffic management policies applied by each ISP and internet quality of service requirements and notices required by law concerning the effective maximum and minimum traffic speeds offered under internet access plans.In order to protect the constitutional rights of privacy and safety of communications, ISPs are prohibited from undertaking surveillance measures over data content on their networks. Also, special summary proceedings have been created in order to safeguard intellectual property rights against violations committed through networks or digital systems. These proceedings include measures designed to withdraw, disqualify or block infringing content in the ISP’s network or systems. The law also provides for the right of intellectual property owners to judicially request from ISPs the delivery of necessary information to identify the provider of infringing content.I-45Fixed-Line and Mobile Telephony ServicesThe provision of fixed-line and mobile telephony services requires a public telecommunications service concession. With respect to mobile services, in 2009, SubTel awarded VTR a license for 30 MHz of spectrum in the 1700/2100 MHz frequency band for the provision of wireless telephony services. The license has a 30-year renewable term. In 2012, VTR transferred this license to its affiliate VTR Wireless SpA (VTR Wireless) which is now a subsidiary of VTR known as VTR Comunicaciones SpA. On January 15, 2014, VTR Wireless received a letter from SubTel in which SubTel asserted that VTR Wireless is not in compliance with the terms of such wireless license. SubTel alleged that the terms of the wireless license require VTR Wireless to comply with certain minimum network coverage and traffic levels. VTR disagrees with SubTel’s assertions regarding the terms of the wireless license and has contested such assertions vigorously.VTR has concessions to provide fixed-line telephony in most major and medium-sized markets in Chile. Telephony concessions are non-exclusive and have renewable 30-year terms. The original term of VTR’s fixed-line telephony concessions expires in November 2025. Long distance telephony services are considered intermediate telecommunications services and, as such, are also regulated by the Ministry. VTR has concessions to provide this service, which is non-exclusive, for a 30-year renewable term expiring in September 2025. In Chile, fixed-line telephony communications between primary zones within the country were, until recently, domestic long distance calls. Then, on November 6, 2013, SubTel eliminated domestic long distance calls and in August 2014, it completed the process of unifying Chile into a single telephone service primary zone. We believe this new system may benefit VTR along with the Chilean fixed-line market as a whole in relation to VTR’s mobile telephony competition. Fixed-line subscribers now have the ability to make phone calls throughout Chile without incurring long-distance charges, thereby making VTR’s fixed-line telephony services more attractive. There are no universal service obligations in Chile. However, local service concessionaires are obligated to provide telephony service to all customers that are within their service area or are willing to pay for an extension to receive service. All local service providers, including VTR, must give long distance telephony service providers equal access to their network connections at regulated prices and must interconnect with all other public services concessionaires whose systems are technically compatible. As a general rule, fixed-line telephony service providers are free to establish the rates directly charged to their customers, unless the Chilean Antitrust Authority concludes that due to a lack of sufficient competition in the market, rates should be fixed by SubTel. However, SubTel sets the maximum rates that may be charged by each operator for interconnect charges, access charges between operators for calls originating on one network that are completed through connections with one or more networks of other providers, and charges for network unbundling services. Rate regulation on interconnection charges is applicable to all fixed-line and mobile telephony companies, including VTR. The determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by operators for their fixed-line or mobile services are made on a case-by-case basis by SubTel and are effective for five years. In September 2014, VTR received a tariff proposal from SubTel that would have retroactive effect to June 2012. The tariff proposal represents a significant reduction in the fixed-line interconnection rates currently charged by VTR. VTR is in the process of formulating its objections and comments to the tariff proposal and is currently unable to reasonably predict the outcome of the tariff-setting process. Final resolution of the tariff-setting process in Chile is expected to occur during the first half of 2015. If the September 2014 tariff proposal were ultimately to be upheld, including retroactive application to June 2012, VTR would be required to issue credit notes of approximately CLP 7.4 billion ($12.2 million) for revenue previously recognized through December 31, 2014. Other Chilean Regulation •Bundling. On December 18, 2012, the Chilean Antitrust Authority issued its regulation governing the on-net/off-net pricing practice in the mobile telephone industry and the offering of bundled telecommunication services. Pursuant to the terms of this regulation, as revised by the Chilean Supreme Court, mobile services may be sold jointly with fixed-line services. However, promotional discounts were not permitted for these double-play offers. As for traditional bundling over the same platform (e.g., bundled fixed-line services such as our double- and triple-play packages, or bundled mobile services), this regulation provides that such services may be bundled, subject to certain price limitations. These limitations require that the total price for a bundle must be greater than the standalone price for the most expensive service included in the bundle. Also, when three or more services are bundled, the price for the bundle must be greater than the sum of the standalone prices for each service in the bundle, excluding the lowest priced service. •Telecommunication Services Proposal. In February 2014, SubTel published a General Telecommunication Services Ruling that regulates the offer of telecommunication services, including voice, internet access, and pay television, either alone or in bundles, from a consumer protection point of view. The new regulation introduced service billing, significant changes in contracts with customers, new requirements regarding compensation in case of service failure, and new rules regarding treatment of customers’ personal information.I-46•Minimum Standards on Quality of Service and Operation. From August 5 to September 4, 2013, SubTel submitted for public comment a draft of the Technical Fundamental Plan on Maintenance and Public Service Telecommunications Network Managing. This draft seeks to impose minimum standards on quality of service and operation of telecommunications networks, in general, and in some particular services: voice services; text and multimedia messages services; data transmission services; minimum coverage for mobile services; and digital terrestrial television minimum coverage. We are uncertain when SubTel will publish the final version of the plan. EmployeesAs of December 31, 2014, we, including our consolidated subsidiaries, had an aggregate of approximately 38,000 full-time equivalent employees, certain of whom belong to organized unions and works councils. Certain of our subsidiaries also use contract and temporary employees, which are not included in this number, for various projects. We believe that our employee relations are good. Financial Information About Geographic AreasFinancial information related to the geographic areas in which we do business appears in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Available InformationAll our filings with the SEC as well as amendments to such filings are available on our internet website free of charge generally within 24 hours after we file such material with the SEC. Our website address is www.libertyglobal.com. The information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference herein.Item 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider the following risk factors in evaluating our results of operations, financial condition, business and operations or an investment in the shares of our company. The risk factors described in this section have been separated into four groups:•risks that relate to the competition we face and the technology used in our businesses;•risks that relate to our operating in overseas markets and being subject to foreign regulation;•risks that relate to certain financial matters; and•other risks, including risks that, among other things, relate to our capitalization and the obstacles faced by anyone who may seek to acquire us. Although we describe below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K the risks we consider to be the most material, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition, business or operations in the future. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the events described below, individually or in combination, were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Factors Relating to Competition and TechnologyWe operate in increasingly competitive markets, and there is a risk that we will not be able to effectively compete with other service providers. The markets for cable television, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services in many of the regions in which we operate are highly competitive. In the provision of video services, we face competition from DTT broadcasters, video provided over satellite platforms, networks using DSL, or in some cases ADSL, technology, FTTx networks and, in some countries where parts of our systems are overbuilt, cable networks, among others. Our operating businesses are facing increasing competition from video services provided by, or over the networks of, incumbent telecommunications operators and other service providers. As the availability and speed of broadband internet increases, we also face competition from over-the-top video content providers utilizing our or our competitors’ high-speed internet connections. In the provision of telephony and broadband internet I-47services, we are experiencing increasing competition from the incumbent telecommunications operators and other service providers in each country in which we operate, as well as mobile providers of voice and data. The incumbent telecommunications operators typically dominate the market for these services and have the advantage of nationwide networks and greater resources than we have to devote to the provision of these services. Many of the incumbent operators are now offering double-play, triple-play and quadruple-play bundles of services. In many countries, we also compete with other operators using LLU to provide these services, other facilities-based operators and wireless providers. Developments in the DSL and other technology used by the incumbent telecommunications operators and alternative providers have improved the attractiveness of our competitors’ products and services and strengthened their competitive position. Developments in wireless technology, such as LTE (the next generation of ultra high-speed mobile data), are creating additional competitive challenges. In some of our markets, national and local government agencies may seek to become involved, either directly or indirectly, in the establishment of FTTx networks, DTT systems or other communications systems. We intend to pursue available options to restrict such involvement or to ensure that such involvement is on commercially reasonable terms. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these pursuits. As a result, we may face competition from entities not requiring a normal commercial return on their investments. In addition, we may face more vigorous competition than would have been the case if there were no government involvement. We expect the level and intensity of competition to continue to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants as a result of changes in the regulatory framework of the industries in which we operate, advances in technology, the influx of new market entrants and strategic alliances and cooperative relationships among industry participants. Increased competition could result in increased customer churn, reductions of customer acquisition rates for some products and services and significant price competition in most of our markets. In combination with difficult economic environments, these competitive pressures could adversely impact our ability to increase or, in certain cases, maintain the revenue, average monthly subscription revenue per average RGU (ARPU), RGUs, operating cash flows, operating cash flow margins and liquidity of our operating segments. Changes in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for our services. Technology in the video, telecommunications and data services industries is changing rapidly, including advances in current technologies and the emergence of new technologies. New technologies, products and services may impact consumer behavior and therefore demand for our products and services. The ability to anticipate changes in technology and consumer tastes and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis will affect our ability to continue to grow, increase our revenue and number of subscribers and remain competitive. New products and services, once marketed, may not meet consumer expectations or demand, can be subject to delays in development and may fail to operate as intended. A lack of market acceptance of new products and services that we may offer, or the development of significant competitive products or services by others, could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating cash flow. Our property and equipment additions may not generate a positive return. The video, broadband internet and telephony businesses in which we operate are capital intensive. Significant additions to our property and equipment are required to add customers to our networks and to upgrade or expand our broadband communications networks and upgrade customer premises equipment to enhance our service offerings and improve the customer experience. These additions require significant capital expenditures for equipment and associated labor costs. Significant competition, the introduction of new technologies, the expansion of existing technologies, such as FTTx and advanced DSL technologies, or adverse regulatory developments could cause us to decide to undertake previously unplanned upgrades of our networks and customer premises equipment in the impacted markets. In addition, no assurance can be given that any future upgrades or extensions of our network (including the planned U.K. network extension) will generate a positive return or that we will have adequate capital available to finance such future upgrades or extensions. If we are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs associated with adding new customers, expanding, extending or upgrading our networks or making our other planned or unplanned additions to our property and equipment, our growth could be limited and our competitive position could be harmed. We depend almost exclusively on our relationships with third-party programming providers and broadcasters for programming content, and a failure to acquire a wide selection of popular programming on acceptable terms could adversely affect our business. The success of our video subscription business depends, in large part, on our ability to provide a wide selection of popular programming to our subscribers. We generally do not produce our own content and we depend on our agreements, relationships and cooperation with public and private broadcasters and collective rights associations to obtain such content. If we fail to obtain a diverse array of popular programming for our pay television services, including a sufficient selection of HD channels as well as non-linear content (such as VoD and DVR capability), on satisfactory terms, we may not be able to offer a compelling video product to our customers at a price they are willing to pay. Additionally, we are frequently negotiating and renegotiating programming agreements and our annual costs for programming can vary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate or renew the terms of our programming agreements on acceptable terms or at all. We expect that programming and I-48copyright costs will continue to rise in future periods as a result of, among other factors, higher costs associated with the expansion of our digital video content, including rights associated with ancillary product offerings and rights that provide for the broadcast of live sporting events, and retransmission or copyright fees payable to public broadcasters.If we are unable to obtain or retain attractively priced competitive content, demand for our existing and future television services could decrease, thereby limiting our ability to attract new customers, maintain existing customers and/or migrate customers from lower tier programming to higher tier programming, thereby inhibiting our ability to execute our business plans. Furthermore, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if certain of our competitors, for example BT and Sky in the U.K., obtain exclusive programming rights, particularly with respect to popular sports and movie programming. In addition, must carry requirements may consume channel capacity otherwise available for more attractive programming. We depend on third-party suppliers and licensors to supply necessary equipment, software and certain services required for our businesses. We rely on third-party vendors for the equipment, software and services that we require in order to provide services to our customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems, terrorism and labor issues. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the equipment, software and services required for our businesses on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. Any shortfall in customer premises equipment could lead to delays in connecting customers to our services, and accordingly, could adversely impact our ability to maintain or increase our RGUs, revenue and cash flows. Also, if demand exceeds the suppliers’ and licensors’ capacity or if they experience financial difficulties, the ability of our businesses to provide some services may be materially adversely affected, which in turn could affect our businesses’ ability to attract and retain customers. Although we actively monitor the creditworthiness of our key third-party suppliers and licensors, the financial failure of a key third-party supplier or licensor could disrupt our operations and have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows. We rely upon intellectual property that is owned or licensed by us to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges could be made against our use of our or our licensed intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, patents and trade secrets) and we may be required to enter into licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, incur monetary damages or be enjoined from use of the intellectual property rights in question. Our businesses that offer mobile telephony and data services rely on the radio access networks of third-party wireless network providers to carry our mobile communications traffic. Our services to mobile customers rely on the use of MVNO arrangements in which we utilize the radio access networks of third-party wireless network providers to carry our mobile communications traffic. If any of our MVNO arrangements are terminated, or if the respective third-party wireless network provider fails to provide the services required under an MVNO arrangement, or if a third-party wireless network provider fails to deploy and maintain its network, and we are unable to find a replacement network operator on a timely and commercial basis or at all, we could be prevented from continuing the mobile services relying on such MVNO arrangement. Additionally, as our MVNO arrangements come to term, we may not be able to renegotiate renewal or replacement MVNO arrangements on the same or more favorable terms. Failure in our technology or telecommunications systems or leakage of sensitive customer data could significantly disrupt our operations, which could reduce our customer base and result in lost revenue. Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology and network systems as well as our customer service centers. The hardware supporting a large number of critical systems for our cable network in a particular country or geographic region is housed in a relatively small number of locations. Our systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power loss, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite security measures, our servers and systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks and similar disruptive actions. Furthermore, our operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. As a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered across all of our markets regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information, information-related risks are increasing, particularly for businesses like ours that handle a large amount of personal customer data. Failure to comply with these data protection laws may result in, among other consequences, fines. Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems affecting our systems could cause failures in our information technology systems or disruption in the transmission of signals over our networks or similar problems. Any disruptive situation that causes loss, misappropriation, misuse or leakage of data could damage our reputation and the credibility of our operations. Further, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide service to our customers or otherwise meet our business obligations in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and net revenue. I-49The “Virgin” brand is used by our subsidiary Virgin Media under licenses from Virgin Enterprises Limited and is not under the control of Virgin Media. The activities of the group of companies utilizing the “Virgin” brand and other licensees could have a material adverse effect on the goodwill of customers towards Virgin Media as a licensee and the licenses from Virgin Enterprises Limited can be terminated in certain circumstances. The “Virgin” brand is integral to Virgin Media’s corporate identity. Virgin Media is reliant on the general goodwill of consumers towards the Virgin brand. Consequently, adverse publicity in relation to the group of companies utilizing the “Virgin” brand or its principals, particularly Sir Richard Branson, who is closely associated with the brand, or in relation to another licensee of the “Virgin” name and logo (particularly in the U.K., where Virgin Media does business) could have a material adverse effect on Virgin Media’s reputation and on Virgin Media’s and our business and results of operations. In addition, the licenses from Virgin Enterprises Limited can be terminated in certain circumstances. For example, Virgin Enterprises Limited can terminate the licenses, after providing Virgin Media with an opportunity to cure, (i) if Virgin Media or any of its affiliates commits persistent and material breaches or a flagrant and material breach of the licenses, (ii) if Virgin Enterprises Limited has reasonable grounds to believe that the use (or lack of use) of the licensed trademarks by Virgin Media has been or is likely to result in a long-term and material diminution in the value of the “Virgin” brand, or (iii) if a third party who is not (or one of whose directors is not) a “fit and proper person”, such as a legally disqualified director or a bankrupt entity, acquires “control” of Liberty Global. Such a termination could have a material adverse effect on Virgin Media’s and our business and results of operations.Factors Relating to Overseas Operations and Foreign RegulationOur businesses are conducted almost exclusively outside of the United States, which gives rise to numerous operational risks. Our businesses operate almost exclusively in countries outside the United States and are thereby subject to the following inherent risks: •fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;•difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;•potentially adverse tax consequences;•export and import restrictions, custom duties, tariffs and other trade barriers;•increases in taxes and governmental fees;•economic and political instability; and•changes in foreign and domestic laws and policies that govern operations of foreign-based companies. Operational risks that we may experience in certain countries include disruptions of services or loss of property or equipment that are critical to overseas businesses due to expropriation, nationalization, war, insurrection, terrorism or general social or political unrest. We are exposed to various foreign currency exchange rate risks. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks with respect to our consolidated debt in situations where our debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support our ability to repay or refinance such debt. Although we generally seek to match the denomination of our and our subsidiaries’ borrowings with the functional currency of the operations that are supporting the respective borrowings, market conditions or other factors may cause us to enter into borrowing arrangements that are not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying operations (unmatched debt). In these cases, our policy is to provide for an economic hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movements by using derivative instruments to synthetically convert unmatched debt into the applicable underlying currency. At December 31, 2014, substantially all of our debt was either directly or synthetically matched to the applicable functional currencies of the underlying operations. In addition to the exposure that results from the mismatch of our borrowings and underlying functional currencies, we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies (non-functional currency risk), such as equipment purchases, programming contracts, notes payable and notes receivable (including intercompany amounts). Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, to the extent that our revenue, costs and expenses are denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies, we will experience fluctuations in our revenue, costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In this regard, we currently expect that during 2015, (1) less than 1% of our revenue, (2) approximately 2% to 4% of our aggregate operating and SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) and (3) approximately 7% to 9% of our property and equipment I-50additions will be denominated in non-functional currencies, including amounts denominated in (a) U.S. dollars in Chile and Europe and (b) euros in Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Switzerland and Hungary. Our expectations with respect to our non-functional currency transactions in 2015 may differ from actual results. Generally, we will consider hedging non-functional currency risks when the risks arise from agreements with third parties that involve the future payment or receipt of cash or other monetary items to the extent that we can reasonably predict the timing and amount of such payments or receipts and the payments or receipts are not otherwise hedged. In this regard, we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain of these risks. Certain non-functional currency risks related to our revenue, operating and SG&A expenses and property and equipment additions were not hedged as of December 31, 2014. For additional information concerning our foreign currency forward contracts, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) as a separate component of equity. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a negative impact on our comprehensive earnings (loss) and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency translation. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk from a foreign currency translation perspective is to the euro and British pound sterling and, to a lesser extent, the Swiss franc, the Chilean peso and other local currencies in Europe. We generally do not hedge against the risk that we may incur non-cash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into U.S. dollars. Our businesses are subject to risks of adverse regulation. Our businesses are subject to the unique regulatory regimes of the countries in which they operate. Cable and telecommunications businesses are subject to licensing or registration eligibility rules and regulations, which vary by country. The provision of electronic communications networks and services requires our licensing from, or registration with, the appropriate regulatory authorities and, for telephony services, entrance into interconnection arrangements with other phone companies, including the incumbent phone company. It is possible that countries in which we operate may adopt laws and regulations regarding electronic commerce, which could dampen the growth of the internet services being offered and developed by these businesses. In a number of countries, our ability to increase the prices we charge for our cable television service or make changes to the programming packages we offer is limited by regulation or conditions imposed by competition authorities or is subject to review by regulatory authorities or is subject to termination rights of customers. In addition, regulatory authorities may grant new licenses to third parties and, in any event, in most of our markets new entry is possible without a license, although there may be registration eligibility rules and regulations, resulting in greater competition in territories where our businesses may already be active. More significantly, regulatory authorities may require us to grant third parties access to our bandwidth, frequency capacity, facilities or services to distribute their own services or resell our services to end customers. Consequently, our businesses must adapt their ownership and organizational structure as well as their pricing and service offerings to satisfy the rules and regulations to which they are subject. A failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on our business or loss of required licenses or other adverse conditions. Adverse changes in rules and regulations could: •impair our ability to use our bandwidth in ways that would generate maximum revenue and operating cash flow;•create a shortage of capacity on our networks, which could limit the types and variety of services we seek to provide our customers;•strengthen our competitors by granting them access and lowering their costs to enter into our markets; and•have a significant adverse impact on our profitability. Businesses, including ours, that offer multiple services, such as video distribution as well as internet and telephony, or that are vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content, often face close regulatory scrutiny from competition authorities in several countries in which we operate. This is particularly the case with respect to any proposed business combinations, which will often require clearance from national competition authorities. The regulatory authorities in several countries in which we do business have considered from time to time what access rights, if any, should be afforded to third parties for use of existing cable television networks and have imposed access obligations in certain countries. This has resulted, for example, in obligations with respect to call termination for our telephony business in Europe, video must carry obligations in many markets in which we operate and video and broadband internet access obligations in Belgium. I-51When we acquire additional communications companies, these acquisitions may require the approval of governmental authorities (either at country or, in the case of the EU, European level), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay an acquisition, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely manner, the governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger transaction, may require restorative measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations. New legislation may significantly alter the regulatory regime applicable to us, which could adversely affect our competitive position and profitability, and we may become subject to more extensive regulation if we are deemed to possess significant market power in any of the markets in which we operate. Significant changes to the existing regulatory regime applicable to the provision of cable television, telephony and internet services have been and are still being introduced. For example, in the EU a large element of regulation affecting our business derives from a number of Directives that are the basis of the regulatory regime concerning many of the services we offer across the EU. The various Directives require Member States to harmonize their laws on communications and cover issues such as access, user rights, privacy and competition. These Directives are reviewed by the EU from time to time and any changes to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which our businesses are regulated and to which we would have to adapt. In addition, we are subject to review by competition or national regulatory authorities in certain countries concerning whether we exhibit Significant Market Power. A finding of Significant Market Power can result in our company becoming subject to pricing, open access, unbundling and other requirements that could provide a more favorable operating environment for existing and potential competitors. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in acquiring new businesses or integrating acquired businesses with our existing operations, or that we will achieve the expected returns on our acquisitions. Historically, our businesses have grown, in part, through selective acquisitions that enabled them to take advantage of existing networks, local service offerings and region-specific management expertise. We expect to seek to continue growing our businesses through acquisitions in selected markets, such as the Virgin Media Acquisition completed in June 2013 and the Ziggo Acquisition completed in November 2014. Our ability to acquire new businesses may be limited by many factors, including availability of financing, debt covenants, the prevalence of complex ownership structures among potential targets, government regulation and competition from other potential acquirers, including private equity funds. Even if we are successful in acquiring new businesses, the integration of these businesses, such as Virgin Media and Ziggo, may present significant costs and challenges associated with: realizing economies of scale in interconnection, programming and network operations; eliminating duplicative overheads; integrating personnel, networks, financial systems and operational systems; greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results, and failure to achieve the business plan with respect to any such acquisition. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in acquiring new businesses or realizing the anticipated benefits of any completed acquisition, including, for example, the Virgin Media Acquisition and the Ziggo Acquisition. In addition, we anticipate that most, if not all, companies acquired by us will be located outside the United States. Foreign companies may not have disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting that are as thorough or effective as those required by U.S. securities laws. While we intend to conduct appropriate due diligence and to implement appropriate controls and procedures as we integrate acquired companies, we may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of these companies’ disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting until we have fully integrated them. The expected benefits of the Virgin Media Acquisition may not be realized. There can be no assurance that the business objectives of our redomestication in the U.K. as a result of the Virgin Media Acquisition will be achieved, particularly as the achievement of the benefits are, in many important respects, subject to factors that we do not control. These factors include such things as the reactions of third parties with whom we enter into contracts and do business and the reactions of investors, analysts and U.K. and U.S. taxing authorities. Our ongoing expenses have increased as a result of the redomestication to the U.K., including those expenses related to complying with U.K. corporate and tax laws. These additional expenses could serve to reduce or offset the benefits realized from the redomestication. In addition, while we believe that, under the current U.S. tax statute and regulations, the Virgin Media Acquisition would not cause Liberty Global to be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for federal tax purposes, the IRS may interpret the current statute and regulations differently, or the U.S. Congress, the IRS, the U.K. Parliament or U.K. tax authorities may enact new statutory or regulatory provisions, which, in each case, could adversely affect our status as a non-U.S. corporation, or otherwise adversely affect our anticipated global tax position. Retroactive statutory or regulatory actions have occurred in the past, and there can be no assurance that any such provisions, if enacted or promulgated, would not have retroactive application to us, the Virgin Media Acquisition or any of our subsequent actions. Our net income and cash flow would be reduced if we were to be subject to U.S. corporate income tax as a domestic corporation.I-52We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in the U.K., the U.S. and many other jurisdictions around the world. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, any material differences as a result of final determinations of tax audits or tax disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period or periods for which determination is made. Because the majority of our subsidiaries have some or all of their ownership through U.S. corporations, our worldwide effective tax rate is subject to provisions of U.S. tax law that defer the imposition of U.S. tax on certain foreign active income until that income is repatriated to the United States. Any repatriation, through our U.S. ownership structure, of assets currently held by subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions or recognition of income that fails to meet the U.S. tax requirements related to deferral of U.S. income tax, may result in a higher effective tax rate for our company. While the company may mitigate this increase in its effective tax rate through claiming a foreign tax credit against its U.S. federal income taxes or potentially have foreign or U.S. taxes reduced under applicable income tax treaties, we are subject to various limitations.We are subject to changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate, including treaties between the U.K., the U.S. and the many other jurisdictions in which we have a presence. Also, various income tax proposals in the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in changes to the existing laws on which our deferred taxes are calculated. A change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a materially higher income or non-income tax expense. Any such material changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate.Further changes in the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project being undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries that encompass most of the jurisdictions in which we operate, is undertaking studies and publishing action plans that include recommendations aimed at addressing what they believe are issues within tax systems that may lead to tax avoidance by companies. It is possible that jurisdictions in which we do business could react to the BEPS initiative or their own concerns by enacting tax legislation that could adversely affect us or our shareholders through increasing our tax liabilities.Factors Relating to Certain Financial MattersOur substantial leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and have other adverse effects. We seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. In this regard, we generally seek to cause our operating subsidiaries to maintain their debt at levels that result in a consolidated debt balance that is between four and five times our consolidated operating cash flow (as defined in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report). As a result, we are highly leveraged. At December 31, 2014, our outstanding consolidated debt and capital lease obligations aggregated $46.2 billion, including $1,550.9 million that is classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet and $42.1 billion that is not due until 2020 or thereafter. We believe that we have sufficient resources to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and capital lease obligations and to fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. As our debt maturities grow in later years, however, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, we completed refinancing transactions in 2013 and 2014 that, among other things, resulted in the extension of certain of our subsidiaries’ debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete additional refinancing transactions or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is difficult to predict how political and economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns or any adverse regulatory developments will impact the credit and equity markets we access and our future financial position. Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants in the credit agreements and indentures of certain of our subsidiaries is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and to achieve adequate returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. For example, if the operating cash flow of our subsidiary, UPC Broadband Holding, were to decline, we could be required to partially repay or limit our borrowings under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in order to maintain compliance with applicable covenants. Accordingly, if our cash provided by operations declines or we encounter other material liquidity requirements, we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to meet our debt obligations and other liquidity requirements as they come due. In addition, our current debt levels may limit our ability to incur additional debt financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, property and equipment additions, or other general corporate requirements. We can give no assurance that any additional debt or equity financing will be available on terms that are as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or at all. During 2014, we purchased $1,596.9 million (including direct acquisition costs) of Liberty Global Class A and Class C ordinary shares. I-53Any cash used by our company in connection with any future purchases of our ordinary shares would not be available for other purposes, including the repayment of debt. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various debt instruments that contain restrictions on how we finance our operations and operate our businesses, which could impede our ability to engage in beneficial transactions. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to significant financial and operating restrictions contained in outstanding credit agreements, indentures and similar instruments of indebtedness. These restrictions will affect, and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit, among other things, the ability of those subsidiaries to: •incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;•pay dividends or make other upstream distributions;•make investments;•transfer, sell or dispose of certain assets, including subsidiary stock;•merge or consolidate with other entities;•engage in transactions with us or other affiliates; or•create liens on their assets. As a result of restrictions contained in these credit facilities, the companies party thereto, and their subsidiaries, could be unable to obtain additional capital in the future to: •fund property and equipment additions or acquisitions that could improve their value;•meet their loan and capital commitments to their business affiliates;•invest in companies in which they would otherwise invest;•fund any operating losses or future development of their business affiliates;•obtain lower borrowing costs that are available from secured lenders or engage in advantageous transactions that monetize their assets; or•conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities. In addition, most of the credit agreements to which these subsidiaries are parties include financial covenants that require them to maintain certain financial ratios, including ratios of total debt to operating cash flow and operating cash flow to interest expense. Their ability to meet these financial covenants may be affected by adverse economic, competitive, or regulatory developments and other events beyond their control, and we cannot assure you that these financial covenants will be met. In the event of a default under such subsidiaries’ credit agreements or indentures, the lenders may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under those agreements or indentures, which could result in a default under other outstanding credit facilities or indentures. We cannot assure you that any of these subsidiaries will have sufficient assets to pay indebtedness outstanding under their credit agreements and indentures. Any refinancing of this indebtedness is likely to contain similar restrictive covenants. We are exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect the debt service obligation of our subsidiaries. We are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily through the credit facilities of certain of our subsidiaries, which are indexed to EURIBOR, LIBOR or other base rates. Although we enter into various derivative transactions to manage exposure to movements in interest rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all. If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate exposure through derivative transactions, any increase in market interest rates would increase our interest rate exposure and debt service obligations, which would exacerbate the risks associated with our leveraged capital structure. We are subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks, which may adversely affect our earnings. While our operations attempt to increase our subscription rates to offset increases in programming and operating costs, there is no assurance that they will be able to do so. In certain countries in which we operate, our ability to increase subscription rates is subject to regulatory controls. Also, our ability to increase subscription rates may be constrained by competitive pressures. Therefore, operating costs may rise faster than associated revenue, resulting in a material negative impact on our cash flow and net earnings I-54(loss). We are also impacted by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits and other administrative costs in certain of our markets. Continuing uncertainties and challenging conditions in the global economy and in the countries in which we operate may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The current macroeconomic environment is highly volatile, and continuing instability in global markets, including the ongoing struggles in Europe related to sovereign debt issues, the risk of deflation and the stability of the euro, has contributed to a challenging global economic environment. Future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the EU Commission to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the overall stability of the eurozone. As a result, we cannot predict how long challenging conditions will exist or the extent to which the markets in which we operate may deteriorate. Additional risks arising from the ongoing economic challenges in Europe are described below under We are exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks in Europe that could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and cash flows.Unfavorable economic conditions may impact a significant number of our subscribers and/or the prices we are able to charge for our products and services, and, as a result, it may be (1) more difficult for us to attract new subscribers, (2) more likely that subscribers will downgrade or disconnect their services and (3) more difficult for us to maintain ARPUs at existing levels. Countries may also seek new or increased revenue sources due to fiscal deficits. Such actions may further adversely affect our company. Accordingly, our ability to increase, or, in certain cases, maintain, the revenue, ARPUs, RGUs, operating cash flow, operating cash flow margins and liquidity of our operating segments could be adversely affected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain or declines further. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.We are exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks in Europe that could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and cash flows. Our operations are subject to macroeconomic and political risks that are outside of our control. For example, high levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and several European countries in which we operate, combined with weak growth and high unemployment, could lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), tax increases, sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and, potentially, disruptions in the credit and equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our company. With regard to currency instability issues, concerns exist in the eurozone with respect to individual macro-fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as well as with respect to the overall stability of the European monetary union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual eurozone countries. The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the European monetary union entirely, which could result in the redenomination of a portion or, in the extreme case, all of our euro-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows to the new currency of the country in which they originated. This could result in a mismatch in the currencies of our assets, liabilities and cash flows. Any such mismatch, together with the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination event, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the eurozone countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our products and services, and accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. Moreover, any changes from euro to non-euro currencies within the countries in which we operate would require us to modify our billing and other financial systems. No assurance can be given that any required modifications could be made within a timeframe that would allow us to timely bill our customers or prepare and file required financial reports. In light of the significant exposure that we have to the euro through our euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments, cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on our company. We may not freely access the cash of our operating companies. Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Our current sources of corporate liquidity include (1) our cash and cash equivalents and (2) interest and dividend income received on our cash and cash equivalents and investments. From time to time, we also receive (1) proceeds in the form of distributions or loan repayments from our subsidiaries or affiliates, (2) proceeds upon the disposition of investments and other assets and (3) proceeds in connection with the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity securities. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject and in some cases our receipt of such payments or advances may be limited due to tax considerations or the presence of noncontrolling interests. Most of our operating subsidiaries are subject to credit agreements or indentures that restrict sales of assets and prohibit or limit the payment of dividends or the making of distributions, loans or advances to shareholders and partners, including us. In addition, because these subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities they have no obligation to provide us funds for payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. I-55We are exposed to the risk of default by the counterparties to our derivative and other financial instruments, undrawn debt facilities and cash investments. Although we seek to manage the credit risks associated with our derivative and other financial instruments, cash investments and undrawn debt facilities, we are exposed to the risk that our counterparties could default on their obligations to us. Also, even though we regularly review our credit exposures, defaults may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. At December 31, 2014, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included (1) derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of $1,040.9 million, (2) cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balances of $1,236.5 million and (3) aggregate undrawn debt facilities of $3,974.1 million. While we currently have no specific concerns about the creditworthiness of any counterparty for which we have material credit risk exposures, the current economic conditions and uncertainties in global financial markets have increased the credit risk of our counterparties and we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of our counterparties could fail or otherwise be unable to meet its obligations to us. Any such instance could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. In this regard, (1) the financial failure of any of our counterparties could reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities and adversely impact our ability to access cash deposited with any failed financial institution, thereby causing a default under one or more derivative contracts, and (2) tightening of the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all.Under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a contractual option to exercise early termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off other liabilities against sums due upon such termination. In an insolvency of a derivative counterparty under the laws of certain jurisdictions, however, the defaulting counterparty or its insolvency representatives may be able to compel the termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination payment liabilities payable by us, reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in addition, the insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set off of amounts due under such derivative contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and the relevant counterparty. Accordingly, it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or may have present or future liabilities owed to us partially or fully discharged by set off as a result of such obligations, in the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty, even though it is the counterparty that is in default and not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our ability to do so will depend on our liquidity and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we will be an unsecured creditor in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the value of any collateral we have obtained from that counterparty.The risks we would face in the event of a default by a counterparty to one of our derivative instruments might be eliminated or substantially mitigated if we were able to novate the relevant derivative contracts to a new counterparty following the default of our counterparty. While we anticipate that, in the event of the insolvency of one of our derivative counterparties, we would seek to effect such novations, no assurance can be given that we would obtain the necessary consents to do so or that we would be able to do so on terms or pricing that would be acceptable to us or that any such novation would not result in substantial costs to us. Furthermore, the underlying risks that are the subject of the relevant derivative contracts would no longer be effectively hedged due to the insolvency of our counterparty, unless and until we novate or replace the derivative contract. We may not report net earnings. We reported losses from continuing operations of $980.9 million, $882.0 million and $583.9 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In light of our historical financial performance, we cannot assure you that we will report net earnings in the near future or ever. Other FactorsThe loss of certain key personnel could harm our business. We have experienced employees at both the corporate and operational levels who possess substantial knowledge of our business and operations. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining their services or that we would be successful in hiring and training suitable replacements without undue costs or delays. As a result, the loss of any of these key employees could cause significant disruptions in our business operations, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. John C. Malone has significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our shareholders. John C. Malone beneficially owns outstanding ordinary shares of Liberty Global representing 25.2% of our aggregate voting power as of February 6, 2015. By virtue of Mr. Malone’s voting power in our company, as well as his position as Chairman of our board of directors, Mr. Malone may have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our shareholders for approval. For example, under English law and our articles of association, certain matters (including amendments to the articles of association) require the approval of 75% of the shareholders who vote (in person or by proxy) on the relevant resolution, and other certain corporate transactions or matters may require the approval of at least 75% of the outstanding shares of each class of our ordinary shares. Because Mr. Malone beneficially owns more than 25% of our aggregate voting power and more than 75% of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares, he has the ability to prevent the requisite approval threshold from being met even though the other shareholders may determine that such action or transaction is beneficial for the Company. I-56Mr. Malone’s rights to vote or dispose of his equity interests in our company are not subject to any restrictions in favor of us other than as may be required by applicable law and except for customary transfer restrictions pursuant to equity award agreements. It may be difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders. Certain provisions of our articles of association and of English law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following: •authorizing a capital structure with multiple classes of ordinary shares: a Class B that entitles the holders to 10 votes per share; a Class A that entitles the holders to one vote per share; and a Class C that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holder to no voting rights;•authorizing the issuance of “blank check” shares (both ordinary and preferred), which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;•classifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors, although under English law, shareholders of our company can remove a director without cause by ordinary resolution;•prohibiting shareholder action by written resolution, thereby requiring all shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders; •requiring the approval of 75% in value of the shareholders (or class of shareholders) and/or English court approval for certain statutory mergers or schemes of arrangements; and•establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings. Change in control provisions in our incentive plan and related award agreements may also discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company, even if such change of control would be in the best interests of our shareholders. The enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult. Because we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts than would currently be the case for U.S. judgments obtained against a U.S. company. It may also be more difficult (or impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts sitting in England than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court. In particular, English law significantly limits the circumstances under which shareholders of English companies may bring derivative actions. Under English law generally, only the Company can be the proper plaintiff in proceedings in respect of wrongful acts committed against us. Our articles of association provide for the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts for shareholder lawsuits against us or our directors.Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.
