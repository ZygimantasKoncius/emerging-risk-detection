ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY WE HAVE INCURRED LOSSES SINCE OUR INCORPORATION AND SINCE THE COMPANY BEGAN ITS EXPLORATION STAGE. WE MAY NEVER BE PROFITABLE WHICH RAISES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. Since the Company was incorporated on September 5, 1975, we have had limited operations and incurred operating losses. As of April 30, 2012, our accumulated deficit since June 11, 2010 when we began our exploration stage is $119,172. We expect to incur additional losses in the foreseeable future, and such losses may be significant. To become profitable, we must be successful in raising capital to continue with exploration activities, procure another property, discover economically feasible mineralization deposits and establish reserves, successfully develop a property and finally realize adequate prices on our minerals in the marketplace. It could be years before we receive any revenues from gold and mineral production, if ever. Thus, we may never be profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a long-term basis. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as described in Note 2 of the Notes to Financial Statements included in this Report. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, investors will likely lose all of their investment in the Company. BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT YET COMMENCED EXPLORATION OPERATIONS, EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS IS DIFFICULT. Though the Company was incorporated on September 5, 1975 we only began the exploration stage of our business on June 11, 2010. We have not earned revenues as of the date of this Report and have incurred total losses of $119,172 from June 11, 2010 to April 30, 2012. Accordingly, our business and our future prospects cannot be evaluated due to our lack of operating history. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by exploration stage companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. In addition, there is no guarantee that we will commence business operations. Even if we do commence operations, at present, we do not know when. Furthermore, prior to completion of our exploration stage, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We therefore expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if we are unable to generate significant revenues from development of any future property we may secure and any production of minerals from the property, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. VERY FEW MINERAL PROPERTIES ARE ULTIMATELY DEVELOPED INTO PRODUCING MINES. The business of exploration for minerals and mining involves a high degree of risk. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of mineralization. Substantial expenditures are required for the Company to establish mineralization reserves through drilling, to develop metallurgical processes, to extract the metal from the ore and, in the case of new properties, to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining. Although substantial benefits may be derived from the discovery of a major mineral deposit, we cannot assure you that the Company will discover minerals in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations or that it can obtain the funds required for development on a timely basis. The economics of developing precious and base metal mineral properties is affected by many factors including the cost of operations, variations in the grade of ore mined, fluctuations in metal markets, costs of processing equipment and other factors such as government regulations, including regulations relating to royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection. FLUCTUATING GOLD, METAL AND MINERAL PRICES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS PLAN. The potential for profitability of our gold and other metal and mineral mining operations and the value of any future mineral property will be directly related to the market price of gold and the metals and minerals that we mine. Historically, gold and other mineral prices have widely fluctuated, and are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including inflation, currency fluctuations, regional and global demand and political and economic conditions. Fluctuations in the price of gold and other minerals that we mine may have a significant influence on the market price of our common stock and a prolonged decline in these prices will have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. OUR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, ATTRACTIVE MINERAL LANDS ARE SCARCE AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN QUALITY PROPERTIES OR RECRUIT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. 5 We compete with many companies in the mining industry, including large, established mining companies with capabilities, personnel and financial resources that far exceed our limited resources. In addition, there is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim-staking, lease or acquisition in Nevada, and other areas where we may conduct exploration activities. We are at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring mineral properties, since we compete with these larger individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs. Likewise, our competition extends to locating and employing competent personnel and contractors to prospect, develop and operate mining properties. Many of our competitors can offer attractive compensation packages that we may not be able to meet. Such competition may result in our Company being unable not only to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these property and personnel resources would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and business. BECAUSE MARKET FACTORS IN THE MINING BUSINESS ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET ANY MINERALS THAT MAY BE FOUND. The mining industry, in general, is intensely competitive and we can provide no assurance to investors that even if minerals are discovered, a ready market will exist from the sale of any ore found. Numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of metals. These factors include market fluctuations, the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment, government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in our not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. WE DEPEND ON OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE LOSS OF THIS INDIVIDUAL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Our Company is completely dependent on Andrea Lucanto, our President, Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Director. As of the date of this Report, Andrea Lucanto was our sole executive officer and director. The loss of her services would significantly and adversely affect our business. We have no life insurance on the life of Andrea Lucanto. MANAGEMENT HAS NO EXPERIENCE IN RESOURCE EXPLORATION. The Company's management, while experienced in business operations, has no experience in resource exploration. The sole executive officer of the Company has no significant technical training or experience in resource exploration or mining. The Company relies on the opinions of consulting geologists that it retains from time to time for specific exploration projects or property reviews. As a result of management's inexperience, there is a higher risk of the Company being unable to complete its business plan. THE NATURE OF MINERAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK AND THE POSSIBILITY OF UNINSURED LOSSES THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS. Exploration for minerals is highly speculative and involves greater risk than many other businesses. Many exploration programs do not result in the discovery of economically feasible mineralization. Few properties that are explored are ultimately advanced to the stage of producing mines. We are subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and developing mineral properties such as, but not limited to: * economically insufficient mineralized material; * fluctuations in production costs that may make mining uneconomical; * labor disputes; * unanticipated variations in grade and other geologic problems; * environmental hazards; 6 * water conditions; * difficult surface or underground conditions; * industrial accidents; personal injury, fire, flooding, cave-ins and landslides; * metallurgical and other processing problems; * mechanical and equipment performance problems; and * decreases in revenues and reserves due to lower gold and mineral prices. Any of these risks can materially and adversely affect, among other things, the development of properties, production quantities and rates, costs and expenditures and production commencement dates. We currently have no insurance to guard against any of these risks. If we determine that capitalized costs associated with any of our mineral interests are not likely to be recovered, we would incur a write-down of our investment in these interests. All of these factors may result in losses in relation to amounts spent which are not recoverable. OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS WHICH COULD REQUIRE US TO DELAY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE FUTURE OPERATIONS ON ANY MINING PROPERTY. Our operations require permits from state and national governmental agencies. We may be unable to obtain these permits in a timely manner, on reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits, or if there is a delay in receiving these permits, our timetable and business plan for exploration of the Property will be adversely affected. THE COSTS TO MEET OUR REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY SUBJECT TO THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY RESULT IN US HAVING INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS OR EVEN TO MEET ROUTINE BUSINESS OBLIGATIONS. Since having become subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal and a host of other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements. We estimate that these costs will range up to $25,000 per year for the next few years and will be higher if our business volume and activity increases. These obligations will reduce our ability and resources to fund other aspects of our business and may prevent us from meeting our normal business obligations. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COMMON STOCK TRADING ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD MAY BE VOLATILE AND SPORADIC, WHICH COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS TO RESELL THEIR SHARES. Our common shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board service of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common shares for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Bulletin Board is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Bulletin Board is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like the American Stock Exchange. Accordingly, our shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares. OUR STOCK IS A PENNY STOCK. TRADING OF OUR STOCK MAY BE RESTRICTED BY THE SEC'S PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS AND FINRA'S SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER'S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK. Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules; which impose additional sales practice 7 requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common shares. FINRA'S SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS MAY ALSO LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER'S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK. In addition to the "penny stock" rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (see above for a discussion of penny stock rules), FINRA rules require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common shares, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. ONE SHAREHOLDER OWNS 85.23% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, WHICH LIMITS OTHER SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF ANY SHAREHOLDER VOTE. Our sole executive officer and a director beneficially owns 85.23% of our outstanding common stock as of the date of this Report. Under our Certificate of Incorporation and the laws of the State of Nevada, the vote of a majority of the shares voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present is generally required to approve most shareholder action. As a result, she is able to control the outcome of shareholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation or proposed mergers or other significant corporate transactions. CERTAIN COMPANY ACTIONS AND THE INTERESTS OF STOCKHOLDERS MAY DIFFER. The voting control of the Company could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or another change-of-control transaction that could be beneficial to stockholders. As a result, the value of stock could be harmed. WE HAVE NEVER PAID A DIVIDEND ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING ANY IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We have not paid a cash dividend on our common stock to date, and we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to successfully develop one or more properties and generate revenue from operations. Notwithstanding, we will likely elect to retain earnings, if any, to finance our growth. Future dividends may also be limited by bank loan agreements or other financing instruments that we may enter into in the future. The declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. 8 WE HAVE NOT VOLUNTARILY IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MEASURES, IN THE ABSENCE OF WHICH, SHAREHOLDERS MAY HAVE MORE LIMITED PROTECTIONS AGAINST INTERESTED DIRECTOR TRANSACTIONS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SIMILAR MATTERS. Recent U. S. legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures required under the rules of national securities exchanges and NASDAQ are those that address board of directors' independence, audit committee oversight and the adoption of a code of ethics. We have not yet adopted any of these corporate governance measures and, since our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ, we are not required to do so. It is possible that if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, shareholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, in the absence of nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions. ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
