ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following information sets out factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those we may make from time to time. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with other matters described in this Form 10-K or incorporated herein by reference in evaluating our business and prospects. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed. In such case, the trading price of our securities could decline, in some cases significantly. There may be other additional risks, not presently known to us, which may also impair our business operations. Our future water revenues are uncertain and depend on a number of factors that may make our revenue streams and profitability volatile. We engage in various water resource acquisitions, management, development, and sale and lease activities. Accordingly, our future revenue streams and profitability will primarily be dependent on our ability to acquire, develop and sell or lease water and water rights. Our long-term profitability will be affected by various factors, including the availability and timing of water resource acquisitions, regulatory approvals and permits associated with such acquisitions, transportation arrangements, and changing technology. We may also encounter unforeseen technical or other difficulties which could result in cost increases with respect to our water resource and water storage development projects. Moreover, our profitability is significantly affected by changes in the market price of water. Future sales and prices of water may fluctuate widely as demand is affected by climatic, economic, demographic and technological factors as well as the relative strength of the residential, commercial, financial, and industrial real estate markets. Additionally, to the extent that we possess junior or conditional water rights, during extreme climatic conditions, such as periods of low flow or drought, our water rights could be subordinated to superior water rights holders. The factors described above are not within our control. One or more of these factors could impact the revenue streams and profitability of our water resources, negatively affect our financial condition and cash flows, and cause our results of operations to be volatile. Our water activities may become concentrated in a limited number of assets, making our growth and profitability vulnerable to fluctuations in local economies and governmental regulations. In the future, we anticipate that a significant amount of our revenues and asset value will come from a limited number of assets, including our water resources in Nevada and Arizona and our Arizona Recharge Facility. Water resources in this region are scarce and we may not be successful in continuing to acquire and develop additional water assets. If we are unable to develop additional water assets, our revenues will be derived from a limited number of assets, primarily located in Arizona and Nevada. As a result of this concentration, our invested capital and results of operations will be vulnerable to fluctuations in local economies and governmental regulations. Our Arizona Recharge Facility is one of the few private sector water storage sites in Arizona. To date, we have stored approximately 212,000 acre feet at the facility for our own account. We have not stored any water on behalf of any customers, and have not as yet generated any revenue from the recharge facility. We believe that the best economic return on the asset will come from storing water in surplus years for sale in dry years; however, we cannot be certain that we will ultimately be able to sell the stored water at a price sufficient to provide an adequate economic profit. 8 We have constructed a pipeline approximately 35 miles long to deliver water from Fish Springs Ranch to the northern valleys of Reno, Nevada. As of December 31, 2009, the total cost of the pipeline project, including our water credits, capitalized on our balance sheet is approximately $101.1 million. To date, Vidler has only entered into sale agreements for a very small proportion of the total amount of water that will be conveyed through the pipeline to the northern valleys of Reno. Although the current market pricing of water in the area exceeds our total cost of the pipeline and water credits, we cannot provide any assurance that the sales prices we may obtain in the future will provide an adequate economic return. Furthermore, the principal buyers of this water are largely real estate developers who are having to contend with the effects of the current economic downturn and if our negotiations with these buyers do not result in prices that are acceptable to us, we may choose to monetize the water resources at a later time, which would have an adverse effect on our near-term revenues and cash flows. General economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, financial condition and our ability to grow or finance our businesses. All of our businesses are sensitive to general economic conditions, both nationally and locally, as well as international economic conditions. General economic conditions and the effects of a recession could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our real estate and water assets, near-term cash flow from operations, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to grow our business. These conditions include higher unemployment, inflation, deflation, increased commodity costs, decreases in consumer demand, changes in buying patterns, a weakened dollar, general transportation and fuel costs, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws or other economic factors that may affect commercial and residential development. Specifically, the recent increase in national unemployment may delay a recovery of the residential real estate market, which could adversely affect the demand for our real estate and water assets. Any prolonged lack of demand for our real estate and water assets could have a significant adverse affect on our revenues, profitability, and cash flows. A prolonged continuation of the significant and sustained downturn that the homebuilding industry is undergoing will materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. The homebuilding industry is experiencing a significant and sustained downturn having been impacted by lack of consumer confidence, housing affordability and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and alternatives to new homes. These factors have resulted in an industry-wide softening of demand for new homes. These conditions in the homebuilding industry have a material adverse effect on the growth of the local economies in our markets where our real estate and water assets are located, which include Nevada, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, and New Mexico. Among other considerations, continuation of the residential and commercial real estate development process is essential for our profitability. Additionally, current economic credit conditions have adversely impacted global credit markets and have restricted liquidity in financial markets. These conditions could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital. Economic conditions, including restricted liquidity in financial markets, could adversely impact various development projects within the markets in which our real estate and water assets are located and this could materially affect our ability to monetize such assets. Declines in the U.S. housing market have reduced revenues and profitability in our real estate and water resource businesses and may continue to do so in the future. We may not be able to realize the anticipated value of our real estate and water assets on our projected timeframe, if at all. The financial markets are experiencing significant volatility, driven by continued fallout from the credit crisis and overall weakening global economy. We expect that the current downturn will have a near term adverse effect on real estate market fundamentals. These events have impacted the values of real estate assets, including potentially our real estate and water assets. Values of real estate assets have declined from the values achieved over the last 24 months. It is uncertain how much of the declines are attributable to the current illiquidity and volatility in the markets, the prospects of a deepening recession and its impact on real estate or a longer-term re-pricing of real estate assets. Depending on how the markets perform over the next several months, or years, these events could result in a decline in the value of our existing real estate and water assets, result in our having to retain such assets for longer than we initially expected, cause us to divest such assets for less than our intended return on investment, or cause us to write-down such assets to realizable value. Such events would adversely impact our profitability, cash flows and financial condition. 9 The fair values of our real estate and water assets are linked to growth factors concerning the local markets in which we operate and may be impacted by broader economic issues. The real estate and water assets we hold have fair values that are significantly affected by the growth in population and the general state of the local economies where our real estate and water assets are located, primarily in the states of Arizona and Nevada, but also in California, Colorado, Idaho, and New Mexico. The recent increase in national unemployment and issues related to the credit markets may deepen or prolong a slowdown of these local economies. This could materially and adversely affect the demand for our real estate and water assets and, consequently, our growth, revenues, and the return on our investment in these assets. We may not receive all of the permitted water rights we expect from the water rights applications we have filed in Nevada. We have filed certain water rights applications in Nevada, primarily as part of the water teaming agreement with Lincoln County. We deploy the capital required to enable the filed applications to be converted into permitted water rights over time as and when we deem appropriate or as otherwise required. We only expend capital in those areas where our initial investigations lead us to believe that we can obtain a sufficient volume of water to provide an adequate economic return on the capital employed in the project. These capital expenditures largely consist of drilling and engineering costs for water production, costs of monitoring wells, and legal and consulting costs for hearings with the State Engineer, and National Environmental Protection Act, or “NEPA”, compliance costs. Until the State Engineer permits the water rights, we can not provide any assurance that we will be awarded all of the water that we expect based on the results of our drilling and our legal position. For example, in 2009, the Nevada State Engineer found that only 396 acre-feet of unappropriated water rights remained in the Tule Desert Groundwater Basin, instead of the 7,240 acre-feet of water rights for which Lincoln/Vidler had applied. As a result, Lincoln/Vidler had to file an appeal of the Nevada State Engineer’s ruling and commence related litigation and it may be a considerable period of time before Lincoln/Vidler is able to ascertain the final volume of water rights that will be permitted by the Nevada State Engineer. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Any significant reduction in the volume of water awarded to us from our base expectations for any water rights could adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and cash flows. Variances in physical availability of water, along with environmental and legal restrictions and legal impediments, could impact profitability. We value our water assets, in part, based upon the volume (amounts in acre-feet) of water we anticipate from water rights applications and permitted rights. The water and water rights held by us and the transferability of these rights to other uses, persons, and places of use are governed by the laws concerning water rights in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, and New Mexico. The volumes of water actually derived from the water rights applications or permitted rights may vary considerably based upon physical availability and may be further limited by applicable legal restrictions. As a result, the volume of water anticipated from the water rights applications or permitted rights do not in every case represent a reliable, firm annual yield of water, but in some cases describe the face amount of the water right claims or management’s best estimate of such entitlement. Additionally, we may face legal restrictions on the sale or transfer of some of our water assets, which may affect their commercial value. If we were unable to transfer or sell our water assets, we may lose some or all of our stated or anticipated returns. If we do not successfully identify, select and manage acquisitions and investments, or if our acquisitions or investments otherwise fail or decline in value, our financial condition could suffer. We acquire and invest in businesses and assets that we believe are undervalued or that will benefit from additional capital, restructuring of operations, strategic initiatives, or improved competitiveness through operational efficiencies. If an acquired business, investment or asset fails or its fair value declines, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, the results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we may not be able to find sufficient opportunities to make our business strategy successful. If we fail to successfully identify, select and manage acquisition and investment opportunities, particularly water and water rights, our business, financial condition, the results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. Such business failures, declines in fair values, and/or failure to successfully identify, select and manage acquisitions or investments, particularly water and water rights, could result in a negative return on equity. We could also lose part or all of our capital in these businesses and experience reductions in our net income, cash flows, assets and equity. Future acquisitions and dispositions of our businesses, assets, operations and investments are possible, and, if unsuccessful, could reduce the value of our common shares. Any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities. Consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common shares may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition, results of operations and trading price at the present time. Failure to successfully manage newly acquired companies could adversely affect our business. Our management of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, taxation, regulatory matters, and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of our management’s time and could distract our management from the day-to-day operations of our business. The diversion of our management’s attention from the day-to-day operations, or difficulties encountered in the integration process, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and the results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to integrate acquired businesses, resources, or assets into our operations successfully, we may be unable to achieve our strategic goals or an economic return and the value of your investment could suffer. We operate in a variety of industries and market sectors, all of which are very competitive and susceptible to economic downturns and would be adversely affected by a recession. A worsening of general economic or market conditions may require us to devote more of our management resources to newly acquired companies and may result in lower valuations for our businesses or investments or have a negative impact on the credit quality of our assets. 10 Our acquisitions may result in dilution to our shareholders and increase our exposure to additional liabilities. We make selective acquisitions of companies that we believe could benefit from our resources of additional capital, business expertise, management direction and oversight, or existing operations. We endeavor to enhance and realize additional value to these acquired companies through our influence and control. Any acquisition could result in the use of a significant portion of our available cash, significant dilution to you, and significant acquisition-related charges. Acquisitions may also result in the assumption of liabilities, including liabilities that are unknown or not fully known to us at the time of the acquisition, which could have a material adverse financial effect on us. Additionally, our acquisitions and investments may yield low or negative returns for an extended period of time, which could temporarily or permanently depress our return on shareholders’ equity, and we may not realize the value of the funds invested. We generally make acquisitions and investments that tend to be long term in nature, and for the purpose of realizing additional value by means of appropriate levels of influence and control. We acquire businesses that we believe to be undervalued or may benefit from additional capital, restructuring of operations or management or improved competitiveness through operational efficiencies with our existing operations or through appropriate and strategic management input. We may not be able to develop acceptable revenue streams and investment returns through the businesses we acquire, and as a result we may lose part or all of our investment in these assets. Additionally, when any of our acquisitions do not achieve acceptable rates of return or we do not realize the value of the funds invested, we may write down the value of such acquisitions or sell the acquired businesses at a loss. Some of our prior acquisitions have lost either part or all of the capital we invested. Unsuccessful acquisitions could have negative impacts on our cash flows, income, assets and shareholders’ equity, which may be temporary or permanent. Moreover, the process we employ to enhance value in our acquisitions and investments can consume considerable amounts of time and resources. Consequently, costs incurred as a result of these acquisitions and investments may exceed their revenues and/or increases in their values, if any, for an extended period of time. Our ability to achieve an acceptable rate of return on any particular investment is subject to a number of factors which may be beyond our control, including increased competition and loss of market share, the ability of management to implement their strategic and operational directives, cyclical or uneven financial results, technological obsolescence, foreign currency risks and regulatory delays. Purchasers of our real estate and water assets may default on their obligations to us and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. In certain circumstances, we finance sales of real estate and water assets, and we secure such financing through deeds of trust on the property, which are only released once the financing has been fully paid off. Purchasers of our real estate and water assets may default on their financing obligations. Such defaults may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and the results of operations, profitability, and cash flows. Our sale of water resources may be subject to environmental regulations which would impact our revenues, profitability, and cash flows. The quality of the water resources we lease or sell may be subject to regulation by the United States Environmental Protection Agency acting pursuant to the United States Safe Drinking Water Act. While environmental regulations do not directly affect us, the regulations regarding the quality of water distributed affects our intended customers and may, therefore, depending on the quality of our water, impact the price and terms upon which we may in the future sell our water resources. If we need to reduce the price of our water resources in order to make a sale to our intended customers, our balance sheet, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. Our water resources sales may meet with political opposition in certain locations, thereby limiting our growth in these areas. The water resources we hold and the transferability of these assets and rights to other uses, persons, or places of use are governed by the laws concerning water rights in the states of Arizona, California, Nevada, Colorado, Idaho, and New Mexico. Our sale of water resources is subject to the risks of delay associated with receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and permits. Additionally, the transfer of water resources from one use to another may affect the economic base or impact other issues of a community including development, and will, in some instances, be met with local opposition including Native American tribes. Moreover, certain of the end users of our water resources, namely municipalities, regulate the use of water in order to manage growth, thereby creating additional requirements that we must satisfy to sell and convey water resources. If we are unable to effectively transfer, sell and convey water resources, our ability to monetize this asset will suffer and our revenues and financial condition would decline. Our insurance companies hold material positions in equities and fixed-income securities which can cause volatility in our profitability and financial condition. Our insurance subsidiaries hold significant positions in equities and fixed-income securities as part of their investment portfolios to cover payments for insurance claims and related costs established in our reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. The fair values of the portfolios are subject to extreme volatility that has affected most markets in 2008 and 2009. For example, during 2008, our insurance company investment portfolios significantly declined in value as global equity and fixed-income markets in general declined in response to the weakening global economy and the tightening of credit availability. As a result of the decline in value of our securities, our financial condition suffered and, in the future, any volatility in our insurance investment portfolios could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flows. Furthermore, if the duration and extent of the declines in value of any of our securities are prolonged, we may have to provide other-than-temporary impairments against such securities which will adversely impact our profitability. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries’ investment portfolios consist in part of thinly-traded U.S. and non-U.S. equities. These equity securities are illiquid in nature and we cannot provide any assurance that we can timely, effectively, and efficiently liquidate and monetize those positions. 11 Our acquisitions of and investments in non-U.S. companies subject us to additional market and liquidity risks which could affect the value of our stock. We have acquired, and may continue to acquire, businesses and securities in non-U.S. public companies and other assets or businesses not located in the U.S. Typically, these non-U.S. securities are not registered with the SEC and regulation of these companies is under the jurisdiction of the relevant non-U.S country. The respective non-U.S regulatory regime may limit our ability to obtain timely and comprehensive financial information for the non-U.S. companies in which we have invested. In addition, if a non-U.S. company in which we invest were to take actions which could be deleterious to its shareholders, non-U.S. legal systems may make it difficult or time-consuming for us to challenge such actions. These factors may affect our ability to acquire controlling stakes, or to dispose of our non-U.S. investments, or to realize the full fair value of our non-U.S. investments. In addition, investments in non-U.S. countries may give rise to complex cross-border tax issues. We aim to manage our tax affairs efficiently, but given the complexity of dealing with U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions, we may have to pay tax in both the U.S. and in non-U.S. countries, and we may be unable to offset any U.S. tax liabilities with non-U.S. tax credits. If we are unable to manage our non-U.S. tax issues efficiently, our financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, our base currency is United States dollars. Accordingly, we are subject to foreign exchange risk through our acquisitions of stocks in non-U.S. public companies. We attempt to mitigate this foreign exchange risk by borrowing funds in the same currency to purchase the equities. Significant fluctuations in the non-U.S. currencies in which we hold investments or consummate transactions could negatively impact our financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows. We also may be unable to effectively and efficiently repatriate funds into the U.S. upon monetization of assets, securities, or businesses not located in the U.S., which could have an impact on our liquidity. Volatile fluctuations in our insurance reserves could cause our financial condition to be materially misstated. Our insurance subsidiaries have established reserves that we believe are adequate to meet the ultimate cost of losses arising from claims. However, it has been, and will continue to be, necessary for our insurance subsidiaries to review and make appropriate adjustments to reserves for claims and expenses for settling claims. Inadequate reserves could cause our financial condition to fluctuate from period to period and cause our financial condition to appear to be better than it actually is for periods in which insurance claims reserves are understated. In subsequent periods if we discover an underestimation and pay the additional claims, our cash needs will be greater than expected and our financial results of operations for that period will be worse than they would have been had our reserves been adequately estimated. The inherent uncertainties in estimating loss reserves are greater for some insurance products than for others, and are dependent on various factors including: · the length of time in reporting claims; · the range of historical losses among claims; · the amount of historical information available during the estimation process; · the degree of impact that changing regulations and legal precedents may have on open claims; and · the consistency of reinsurance programs over time. Because medical malpractice liability, commercial property and casualty, and workers’ compensation claims may not be completely paid off for several years, estimating reserves for these types of claims can be more uncertain than estimating reserves for other types of insurance. As a result, precise reserve estimates cannot be made for several years following the year for which reserves were initially established. During the past several years, the levels of the reserves for our insurance subsidiaries have been very volatile. We have had to significantly increase and decrease these reserves in the past several years. We may need to significantly increase the reserves in the future, and the future level of reserves for our insurance subsidiaries may be volatile. These increases or volatility may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and the results of operations and cash flows. If we underestimate the amount of reinsurance we need or if the companies with which we have reinsurance agreements default on their obligations, we may be unable to cover claims made and that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We have reinsurance agreements with reinsurance companies on all of our insurance books of business. We purchase reinsurance based upon our assessment of the overall direct underwriting risk. It is possible that we may underestimate the amount of reinsurance required to achieve the desired level of net claims risk, and a claim may exceed the combined value of our reserve and the amount of reinsurance available. Additionally, our reinsurers could default on amounts owed to us for their portion of the direct insurance claim. Our insurance subsidiaries, as direct writers of lines of insurance, have ultimate responsibility for the payment of claims, and any defaults by reinsurers may result in our established reserves not being adequate to meet the ultimate cost of losses arising from claims. If claims made exceed the amount of our direct reserves and the available reinsurance, we may be subject to regulatory action or litigation and our results of operation and cash flows would suffer as a result. State regulators could require changes to our capitalization and/or to the operations of our insurance subsidiaries, and/or place them into rehabilitation or liquidation. Beginning in 1994, our subsidiaries, Physicians and Citation, became subject to the provisions of the Risk-Based Capital for Insurers Model Act which has been adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for the purpose of helping regulators identify insurers that may be in financial difficulty. The Model Act contains a formula which takes into account asset risk, credit risk, underwriting risk and all other relevant risks. Under this formula, each insurer is required to report to regulators using formulas which measure the quality of its capital and the relationship of its modified capital base to the level of risk assumed in specific aspects of its operations. The formula does not address all of the risks associated with the operations of an insurer. The formula is intended to provide a minimum threshold measure of capital adequacy by an individual insurance company and does not purport to compute a target level of capital. Companies which fall below the threshold will be placed into one of four categories: Company Action Level, where the insurer must submit a plan of corrective action; Regulatory Action Level, where the insurer must submit such a plan of corrective action, the regulator is required to perform such examination or analysis the Superintendent of Insurance considers necessary and the regulator must issue a corrective order; Authorized Control Level, which includes the above actions and may include rehabilitation or liquidation; and Mandatory Control Level, where the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer. As of December 31, 2009, all of our insurance subsidiaries’ risk-based capital results exceeded the Company Action Level. However, we cannot assure you that insurance subsidiaries’ risk-based capital results will exceed the Company Action Level in the future. If the risk-based capital of any of our insurance subsidiaries fails to exceed the Company Action Level, we will be subject to the regulatory action described above and our results of operations could suffer. 12 We may not be able to retain key management personnel we need to succeed, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully operate our businesses. To run our day-to-day operations and to successfully manage newly acquired companies we must, among other things, continue to attract and retain key management. We rely on the services of several key executive officers. If they depart, it could have a significant adverse effect upon our business. Mr. Hart, our CEO, is key to the implementation of our strategic focus, and our ability to successfully develop our current strategy is dependent upon our ability to retain his services. Also, increased competition for skilled management and staff employees in our businesses could cause us to experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability. We use estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses may differ by using different assumptions. In addition, in future periods, in order to incorporate all known experience at that time, we may have to revise assumptions previously made which may change the value of previously reported assets and liabilities. This potential subsequent change in value may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and the results of operations and cash flows. Because our operations are diverse, analysts and investors may not be able to evaluate us adequately, which may negatively influence the price of our stock. We are a diversified holding company with investments and operations in a variety of business segments. Each of these areas is unique, complex in nature, and difficult to understand. In particular, the water resource business is a developing industry in the United States with very little historical data, very few experts and a limited following of analysts. Because we are complex, analysts and investors may not be able to adequately evaluate our operations and enterprise as a going concern. This could cause analysts and investors to make inaccurate evaluations of our stock, or to overlook PICO in general. As a result, the trading volume and price of our stock could suffer and may be subject to excessive volatility. Fluctuations in the market price of our common stock may affect your ability to sell your shares. The trading price of our common stock has historically been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to fluctuations. The market price of our common stock may be significantly impacted by: · quarterly variations in financial performance and condition; · shortfalls in revenue or earnings from estimates forecast by securities analysts or others; · changes in estimates by such analysts; · product introductions; · the availability of economically viable acquisition or investment opportunities, including water resources and real estate, which will return an adequate economic return; · our competitors’ announcements of extraordinary events such as acquisitions; · litigation; and · general economic conditions and other matters described herein. Our results of operations have been subject to significant fluctuations, particularly on a quarterly basis, and our future results of operations could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. Causes of such fluctuations may include the inclusion or exclusion of operating earnings from newly acquired or sold operations. Statements or changes in opinions, ratings, or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which we do business or relating to us specifically could result in an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could affect the value of your investment and your ability to sell your shares. In addition, some investors favor companies that pay dividends, particularly in market downturns. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and, therefore, we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock. We may need additional capital in the future to fund the growth of our business and acquisitions, and financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our shareholders. We currently anticipate that our available capital resources and operating income will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot provide any assurance that such resources will be sufficient to fund the long-term growth of our business and acquisitions. We may raise additional funds through public or private debt, equity or hybrid securities financings, including, without limitation, through the issuance of securities pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC. We may experience difficulty in raising necessary capital in view of the recent volatility in the capital markets and increases in the cost of finance. Increasingly stringent rating standards could make it more difficult for use to obtain financing. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot provide any assurance that any additional financing we may need will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, respond to competitive pressures or otherwise execute our strategic plan would be significantly limited. In any such case, our business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 13 Litigation may harm our business or otherwise distract our management. Substantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur large expenditures and distract our management. For example, lawsuits by employees, shareholders or customers could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. Additionally, from time to time we or our subsidiaries will have disputes with companies or individuals which may result in litigation that could necessitate our management’s attention and require us to expend our resources. We may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure to specific litigation and we cannot provide any assurance that we will always be able to resolve such disputes out of court or on terms favorable to us. We may be forced to resolve litigation in a manner not favorable to us, and such resolution could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Our governing documents could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock. Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and the California General Corporation Law could discourage a third party from acquiring, or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, control of our company without approval of our board of directors. For example, our bylaws require advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 1203 of the California General Corporation Law, which requires a fairness opinion to be provided to our shareholders in connection with their consideration of any proposed “interested party” reorganization transaction. All or any of these factors could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. We are impacted by international affairs, which directly expose us to the adverse effects of any foreign economic or governmental instability. Because our investments are globally diversified, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by: · exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates; · the imposition of governmental controls; · the need to comply with a wide variety of non-U.S. and U.S. tax laws; · political and economic instability; · volatile interest rates; · exchange controls which may limit our ability to withdraw money; and · general economic conditions outside the United States. Changes in any or all of these factors could result in reduced market values of our investments, loss of assets, additional expenses, reduced investment income, reductions in shareholders’ equity due to foreign currency fluctuations. If we were to experience any of these negative effects, we may be required to reduce our global diversification. If equity analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline. The trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. THE FOREGOING FACTORS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND COULD MAKE COMPARISON OF HISTORIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS AND BALANCES, DIFFICULT OR NOT MEANINGFUL.
