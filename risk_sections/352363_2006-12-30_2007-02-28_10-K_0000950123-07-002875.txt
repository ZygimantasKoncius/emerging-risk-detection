Item 1A. Risk Factors. Risks Associated with Competition and the Marketplace The apparel and related product markets are highly competitive, both within the United States and abroad. The Companys ability to compete successfully within the marketplace depends on a variety of factors, including:  The continuing challenging retail and macroeconomic environment, including the levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending, and levels of customer traffic within department stores, malls and other shopping and selling environments, and a continuation of the deflationary trend for apparel products;  The Companys ability to successfully continue to evolve its supply chain system, including its product development, sourcing, logistics and technology functions, to reduce product cycle-time and costs and meet customer demands;  The Companys ability to effectively anticipate, gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes, across multiple product lines, shopping channels and geographies;  The Companys ability to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings relatively far in advance, while minimizing excess inventory positions, including the Companys ability to correctly balance the level of its fabric and/or merchandise commitments with actual customer orders;  Consumer and customer demand for, and acceptance and support of, Company products (especially by the Companys largest customers) which are in turn dependent, among other things, on product design, quality, value and service;  Risks associated with the possible failure of the Companys unaffiliated manufacturers to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner, to meet quality standards or to comply with the Companys policies regarding labor practices or applicable laws or regulations; 14  The Companys ability to adapt to and compete effectively in the current quota environment, including changes in sourcing patterns resulting from the elimination of quota on apparel products, as well as lowered barriers to entry;  Risks associated with the Companys dependence on sales to a limited number of large United States department store customers, including risks related to the Companys ability to respond effectively to:  these customers buying patterns, including their purchase and retail floor space commitments for apparel in general (compared with other product categories they sell), and our products specifically (compared with products offered by our competitors, including with respect to customer and consumer acceptance, pricing and new product introductions);  these customers strategic and operational initiatives, including their continued focus on further development of their private label initiatives;  these customers desire to have us provide them with exclusive and/or differentiated designs and product mixes;  these customers requirements for vendor margin support;  any credit risks presented by these customers, especially given the significant proportion of our accounts receivable they represent; and  the effect that any potential consolidation among one or more of these larger customers, such as the merger between Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Store Company, might have on the foregoing and/or other risks;  Risks associated with maintaining and enhancing favorable brand recognition, which may be affected by consumer attitudes towards the desirability of fashion products bearing a mega brand label and which are widely available at a broad range of retail stores; and  Risks associated with the Companys operation and expansion of retail business, including the ability to successfully find appropriate sites, negotiate favorable leases, design and create appealing merchandise, appropriately manage inventory levels, install and operate effective retail systems, apply appropriate pricing strategies, and integrate such stores into the Companys overall business mix. Management and Employee Risks  The Companys ability to attract and retain talented, highly qualified executives and other key personnel in design, merchandising, sales, marketing, production, systems and other functions;  The Companys ability to hire and train qualified retail management and associates;  Risks associated with any significant disruptions in the Companys relationship with its employees, including union employees, and any work stoppages by the Companys employees, including union employees;  Risks associated with providing for the succession of senior management; and  Risks associated with realignment of responsibilities among the Companys management team. Economic, Social and Political Factors Also impacting the Company and its operations are a variety of economic, social and political factors, including the following:  Risks associated with war, the threat of war and terrorist activities, including reduced shopping activity as a result of public safety concerns and disruption in the receipt and delivery of merchandise;  Changes in national and global microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions in the markets where the Company sells or sources its products, including the levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending, consumer income growth, personal debt levels, rising energy costs and energy shortages, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and stock market volatility, and currency devaluations in countries in which we source product;  Changes in social, political, legal and other conditions affecting foreign operations;  Risks of increased sourcing costs, including costs for materials and labor, including as a result of the elimination of quota on apparel products;  Any significant disruption in the Companys relationships with its suppliers, manufacturers as well as work stoppages by any of the Companys suppliers or service providers;  The enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international trade regulations, or executive action affecting international textile agreements, including the United States reevaluation of the trading status of certain countries and/or retaliatory duties, quotas or other trade sanctions, which, if enacted, would increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries, and the January 1, 2005 elimination of quota, which may significantly impact sourcing patterns; and  Risks related to the Companys ability to establish, defend and protect its trademarks and other proprietary rights and other risks relating to managing intellectual property issues. 15 Risks Associated with Acquisitions and New Product Lines and Markets The Company, as part of its growth strategy, from time to time acquires new product lines and/or enters new markets, including through licensing arrangements. These activities (which also include the development and launch of new product categories and product lines), are accompanied by a variety of risks inherent in any such new business venture, including the following:  Ability to identify appropriate acquisition candidates and negotiate favorable financial and other terms, against the background of increasing market competition (from both strategic and financial buyers) for the types of acquisitions the Company have been making;  Risks that the new product lines or market activities may require methods of operations and marketing and financial strategies different from those employed in the Companys other businesses, including risks associated with acquisitions with significant foreign operations. In addition, these businesses may involve buyers, store customers and/or competitors different from the Companys historical buyers, store customers and competitors;  Risks associated with selling our Liz & Co. and Concepts by Claiborne brands outside of better department stores;  Possible difficulties, delays and/or unanticipated costs in integrating the business, operations, personnel and/or systems of an acquired business;  Risks that projected or satisfactory level of sales, profits and/or return on investment for a new business will not be generated;  Risks involving the Companys ability to retain and appropriately motivate key personnel of an acquired business;  Risks that expenditures required for capital items or working capital will be higher than anticipated;  Risks associated with unanticipated events and unknown or uncertain liabilities;  Uncertainties relating to the Companys ability to successfully integrate an acquisition, maintain product licenses, or successfully launch new products and lines;  Certain new businesses may be lower margin businesses and may require the Company to achieve significant cost efficiencies; and  With respect to businesses where the Company acts as licensee, the risks inherent in such transactions, including compliance with terms set forth in the applicable license agreements, including among other things the maintenance of certain levels of sales, and the public perception and/or acceptance of the licensors brands or other product lines, which are not within the Companys control.
