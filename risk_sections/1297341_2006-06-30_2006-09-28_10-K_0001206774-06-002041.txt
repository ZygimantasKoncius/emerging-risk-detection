Item 1A. Risk Factors A significant percentage of the Banks assets is invested in lower yielding liquid investments. Our inability to reinvest these assets into higher yielding assets such as loans will continue to hinder our ability to be more profitable. We have been unable to invest as much of First Federal of Hazards liquidity into loans due to insufficient loan demand in the market area. At June 30, 2006, $3.7 million, or 3.1% of its assets were invested in cash or cash equivalents, and $76.2 million, or 63.9% of assets, were invested in U.S. Government agency obligations and mortgage-backed securities. These investments yield substantially less than would be obtained if such funds were invested in loans. As a result, our interest income has suffered. We may not be able to achieve sufficient growth in our retail franchise to allow us to achieve the anticipated benefits of our merger with Frankfort First Bancorp. We believe that First Federal of Hazards lending activity and loans receivable will continue to increase in a profitable manner by utilizing various loan products currently offered by First Federal of Frankfort, such as adjustable-rate mortgages. However, it is possible that local market factors, including competition from other lenders and continuing increases in interest rates may preclude significant growth from an increased product line. We also believe that over time First Federal of Hazard can develop additional deposit products such as those offered by First Federal of Frankfort (such as individual retirement accounts or checking accounts), but we have not yet fully explored their cost effectiveness nor their viability in First Federal of Hazards market. We intend to efficiently utilize excess liquidity at either Bank or Kentucky First by buying and selling whole loans or participations in loans between First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Frankfort, with the originating bank retaining servicing of any loans sold, or by making deposits into accounts at either bank, subject to regulatory limitations, in order to maximize the potential earnings of each bank. This strategy will not succeed if we do not maintain sufficient loan demand at First Federal of Frankfort or sufficient deposit growth at First Federal of Hazard. At June 30, 2006, Frankfort First had total real estate loans of $118.8 million, compared to $114.8 million at June 30, 2005, an increase of approximately $4.0 million, or 3.5%. At June 30, 2006, Federal of Hazard had total deposits of $81.9 million, compared to total deposits of $86.6 million at June 30, 2005, a decrease of $4.7 million, or 5.4%. There can be no assurance as to if or when this strategy can be accomplished. In an attempt to increase the overall interest rate spread of the combined company, management may adopt strategies that result in decreases in the assets and/or liabilities of either or both Banks. Rising interest rates may hurt our profits and asset values. If interest rates continue to rise, our net interest income would likely decline in the short term since, due to the generally shorter terms of interest-bearing liabilities, interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, increases more quickly than interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments. In addition, a continuation of rising interest rates may hurt our income because of reduced demand for new loans, the demand for refinancing loans and the interest and fee income earned on new loans and refinancings. At June 30, 2006, in the event of an instantaneous and permanent 200 basis point increase in interest rates, our net portfolio value, which represents the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest-earning and other assets and outgoing cash flows on interest-bearing liabilities, would be expected to decrease by approximately 16%. While we believe that modest interest rate increases will not significantly hurt our interest rate spread over the long term due to our high level of liquidity and the presence of a significant amount of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in our loan portfolio, interest rate increases may initially reduce our interest rate spread until such time as our loans and investments reprice to higher levels. Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets, and in particular our securities portfolio. Generally, the value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as separate components of equity. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates therefore could have an adverse effect on shareholders equity. 18 Strong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth. Although we consider ourselves competitive in our market areas, we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in our earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which reduces net interest income. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability will depend upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market areas. The distressed economy in First Federal of Hazards market area could hurt our profits and slow our growth. First Federal of Hazards market area consists of Perry and surrounding counties in eastern Kentucky. The economy in this market area has been distressed in recent years due to the decline in the coal industry on which the economy has been dependent. While there has been improvement in the economy from the influx of other industries, such as health care and manufacturing, and there may be signs that the coal industry is improving with the rising costs of petroleum, the economy in First Federal of Hazards market area continues to lag behind the economies of Kentucky and the United States. As a result, First Federal of Hazard has experienced insufficient loan demand in its market area. While First Federal of Hazard will seek to use excess funds to purchase loans from First Federal of Frankfort, we expect the redeployment of funds from securities into loans to take several years. Moreover, the slow economy in First Federal of Hazards market area will limit our ability to grow our asset base in that market. We operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. We are subject to extensive government regulation, supervision and examination. Such regulation, supervision and examination govern the activities in which we may engage, and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and our depositors. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. We expect that our return on equity will be low compared to other companies as a result of our recently completed public offering. Return on average equity, which equals net income divided by average equity, is a ratio used by many investors to compare the performance of a particular company with other companies. For the year ended June 30, 2006, our return on average equity was 2.68%. Over time, we intend to deploy our excess capital into higher-yielding assets, such as loans, with the goal of increasing earnings per share and book value per share, without assuming undue risk, and achieving a return on average equity that is competitive with other publicly held subsidiaries of mutual holding companies. This goal could take a number of years to achieve, and we cannot assure you that it will be attained. Consequently, you should not expect a competitive return on average equity in the near future. Failure to achieve a competitive return on average equity might make an investment in our common stock unattractive to some investors and might cause our common stock to trade at lower prices than comparable companies with higher returns on average equity. Additional annual employee compensation and benefit expenses will reduce our profitability and stockholders equity. We will recognize additional annual material employee compensation and benefit expenses stemming from the shares granted to employees and executives under new benefit plans. We cannot predict the actual amount of these new expenses because applicable accounting practices require that they be based on the fair market value of the shares of common stock at specific points in the future. We would recognize expenses for our employee stock ownership plan when shares are committed to be released to participants accounts and would recognize expenses 19 for restricted stock awards and options over the vesting periods of the awards. These annual after-tax expenses have been estimated to be approximately $393,000. Actual expenses, however, may be higher or lower, depending on the then-prevailing price of our common stock. Employees of both subsidiary Banks participate in a defined-benefit plan through Pentegra. In recent years, the cost of this plan has increased dramatically and costs could continue to increase. It is also possible that legislation will be enacted that would increase the Banks obligations under the plan or change the methods the Banks use in accounting for the plans that could affect personnel expense and the Companys balance sheet. In 2006, the total contribution of both Banks was $508,000. First Federal MHC owns a majority of our common stock and is able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders, including preventing sale or merger transactions you may like or a second-step conversion by First Federal MHC. First Federal MHC owns a majority of our common stock and, through its board of directors, is able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders. As a federally chartered mutual holding company, the board of directors of First Federal MHC must ensure that the interests of depositors of First Federal of Hazard are represented and considered in matters put to a vote of stockholders of Kentucky First. Therefore, the votes cast by First Federal MHC may not be in your personal best interests as a stockholder. For example, First Federal MHC may exercise its voting control to prevent a sale or merger transaction in which stockholders could receive a premium for their shares, prevent a second-step conversion transaction by First Federal MHC or defeat a stockholder nominee for election to the board of directors of Kentucky First. However, implementation of a stock-based incentive plan will require approval of Kentucky Firsts stockholders other than First Federal MHC. In addition, Office of Thrift Supervision regulations prohibit, for three years following the completion of our public offering, the acquisition of more than 10% of any class of equity security of the company without the prior approval of the Office of Thrift Supervision. Even after this three-year period, Office of Thrift Supervision regulations would likely prevent an acquisition of Kentucky First other than by another mutual holding company or a mutual institution. There may be a limited market for our common stock which may lower our stock price. Although our shares of common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, there is no guarantee that the shares will be regularly traded. If an active trading market for our common stock does not develop, you may not be able to sell all of your shares of common stock on short notice and the sale of a large number of shares at one time could temporarily depress the market price.
