ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Investing in our common shares involves risks. Prior to making a decision about investing in our common shares, you should consider carefully the factors discussed below and the information contained in this Annual Report. Each of these risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and cause the value of our common shares to decline, which may result in the loss of part or all of your investment. Our exclusive license to provide water to retail customers in the Cayman Islands may not be renewed in the future. In the Cayman Islands, we provide water to retail customers under a license issued to us in July 1990 by the Cayman Islands government that grants us the exclusive right to provide water to retail customers within our licensed service area. Our service area is comprised of an area on Grand Cayman that includes the Seven Mile Beach and West Bay areas, two of the three most populated areas in the Cayman Islands. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated approximately 36% of our consolidated revenues and 52% of our consolidated gross profits from the retail water operations conducted pursuant to our exclusive license. If we are not in default of any of its terms, the license provides us with the right of first refusal to renew the license on terms that are no less favorable than those that the government offers to any third party. This license was set to expire on July 10, 2010; however, we and the Cayman Islands government have extended the license several times in order to provide sufficient time to negotiate the terms of a new license agreement. The most recent extension of our license expires June 30, 2014. In February 2011, the Water (Production and Supply) Law, 2011 (which replaces the Water (Production and Supply) Law (1996 Revision)) and the Water Authority (Amendment) Law, 2011 (the “New Laws”) were published and are now in full force and effect. Under the New Laws, the Water Authority-Cayman (“WAC”) would issue any new license which could include a rate of return on invested capital model described below. We have been advised in correspondence from the Cayman Islands government and the WAC that: (i) the WAC is now the principal negotiator, and not the Cayman Islands government, in these license negotiations, and (ii) the WAC has determined that a rate of return on invested capital model (“RCAM”) is in the best interest of the public and the Company’s customers. RCAM is the rate model currently utilized in the electricity transmission and distribution license granted by the Cayman Islands government to the Caribbean Utilities Company, Ltd. We have advised the Cayman Islands government that we do not agree with its position on the two issues. In July 2012, in an effort to resolve several issues relating to our retail license renewal negotiations, we filed an Application for Leave to Apply for Judicial Review (the “Application”) with the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands (the “Court”), stating that: (i) certain provisions of the Water Authority Law, 2011 and the Water (Production and Supply) Law, 2011, appear to be incompatible, (ii) the WAC’s roles as the principal license negotiator, statutory regulator and our competitor put the WAC in a position of hopeless conflict, and (iii) the WAC’s decision to replace the rate structure under our current exclusive license with RCAM was predetermined and unreasonable. Throughout the course of the retail license renewal negotiations, we have objected to the use of RCAM on the basis that we believe such a model would not promote the efficient operation of our water utility and could ultimately increase water rates to our customers. In October 2012, we were notified that the Court agreed to consider the issues outlined in the Application. As a result, our Company, the Cayman Islands government and the WAC will have the opportunity to present their positions to the Court in a trial proceeding. We have been notified by the Court that the first hearing for this judicial review has been scheduled for April 1-2, 2014. In August 2013, we met with representatives of the Cayman Islands government and the WAC to discuss the status of our license negotiations. As a result of this meeting, all parties agreed to await the outcome of the pending judicial review before recommencing any meaningful negotiations on the license. Subsequently our water utility license on Grand Cayman was extended until June 30, 2014 to allow additional time for the judicial review proceedings to conclude. If we do not ultimately enter into a new license agreement and no other party is awarded a license, we expect to be permitted to continue to supply water to our service area. The Cayman Islands government could offer a third party a license to service some or all of our present service area. In such event, we may assume the license offered to the third party by exercising our right of first refusal. However, the terms of any new license agreement may not be as favorable to us as the terms under which we are presently operating and could materially reduce the operating income and cash flows that we have historically generated from our retail license and could require us to record an impairment loss to reduce the $3,499,037 carrying value of our goodwill. Such impairment loss could be material to our results of operations. 19 We rely on fixed-term water supply agreements with our bulk customers in the Cayman Islands, Belize and The Bahamas, which may not be renewed or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us. All of our bulk water supply agreements are for fixed terms ranging originally from seven to 23 years and with a range of less than one to 20 years remaining. Upon expiration, these agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us. In addition, certain of these agreements for plants not owned by us provide for our customers to take over the operations of the plant upon expiration of the contract term. If this occurs, we may no longer generate income from such plants. In instances where we own the plant that produces the water under an agreement that is not renewed or renewed with lower production quantities, we may not be able to find a new customer for the plant’s excess production capacity. If our fixed-term agreements are not renewed or are renewed on terms less favorable to us, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. The water supply agreement with the Water and Sewerage Corporation of The Bahamas (“WSC”) for our Windsor plant expired in July 2013 with the delivery of the total amount of water required under the agreement. We have submitted a proposal to the WSC to continue to supply water from the Windsor plant for a period of five years and are awaiting their reply. At the request of the government of The Bahamas, we continue to operate the Windsor plant to provide the government of The Bahamas with additional time to decide whether or not government will enter into a new water supply agreement with us for the Windsor plant. We generated $7.5 million in revenues from this plant during the year ended December 31, 2013. We have spent approximately $12.9 million to fund the development costs for a possible project in Mexico and expect to expend significant additional funds in 2014 and 2015 to continue to pursue this project. However, we may not be successful in completing this project. We own (through our wholly-owned Netherlands subsidiary, Consolidated Water Cooperatief, U.A.) a 99.9 % interest in N.S.C. Agua, S.A. de C.V., (“NSC”), a development stage Mexico company formed to pursue a project encompassing the construction, operation and minority ownership of a 100 million gallon per day seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant to be located in northern Baja California, Mexico and an accompanying pipeline to deliver water to the Mexican potable water system and the U.S. border. If this project is completed, we expect to participate in the operation of the plant and pipeline and also expect to retain a minority ownership position in the project. NSC has conducted an equipment piloting plant and water quality data collection program at the proposed feed water source and is presently seeking contracts for the electric power and feed water sources for the plant’s proposed operations. NSC will be required to accomplish various additional steps before it can commence construction of the plant and pipeline including, but not limited to, completing the purchases of land required for the project, obtaining approvals and permits from various governmental agencies in Mexico and the United States, securing contracts with its proposed customers to sell water in sufficient quantities and at prices that make the project financially viable, and obtaining equity and debt financing for the project. NSC’s potential customers will also be required to obtain various governmental permits and approvals in order to purchase water from NSC. As of December 31, 2013, we have spent approximately $12.9 million on this project. During the first quarter of 2014 we (i) exercised an option to purchase the shares of one of the other shareholders of NSC for $1.0 million, increasing our ownership in NSC to 99.9%; and (ii) decided not to extend a Memorandum of Understanding with one of our contractors, electing instead to reimburse this contractor $350,000 for work performed in connection with our pilot plant and water data collection program. NSC has entered into a purchase contract for 8.1 hectares of land on which the proposed plant would be constructed. In 2012, NSC obtained an extension of this purchase contract through May 15, 2014 in exchange for prepayments of (i) $500,000 paid at signing of the extension and (ii) a further $500,000 paid in May 2013. NSC is required to pay a balance of $6.98 million on May 15, 2014 to complete the purchase of this land. In 2013, NSC purchased an additional 12 hectares of land, which constitute most of the land required for the project, for $12 million, of which $2 million has been paid. The remaining $10 million balance for this purchase is due on May 15, 2014. We have determined that completing NSC’s development activities will require significant additional funding beyond the share purchase option and pilot plant expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2014 and the remaining $17 million due to purchase the land for the project site. We expect to incur significant development expenses in 2014 and 2015 for this project. We estimate that it will take at least until the first quarter of 2015 for NSC to complete all of the development activities (which include completing the site piloting plant activities, completing the purchase of the land for the plant, securing feed water and power supplies, completing the engineering and feasibility studies, negotiating customer contracts, obtaining the required rights-of-way and regulatory permits and arranging the project financing) necessary to commence construction of the plant and pipeline. However, NSC may ultimately be unable to complete all of the activities necessary to begin construction of the project. We expect the fair value of our investment in OC-BVI to decrease as its sole water supply contract matures. If this decrease in fair value occurs, we will be required to record impairment losses in future periods to reduce the carrying value of our investment in OC-BVI to its decreased fair value. We account for our investment in OC-BVI under the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock. This method requires recognition of a loss on an equity investment that is other than temporary, and indicates that a current fair value of an equity investment that is less than its carrying amount may indicate a loss in the value of the investment. As a quoted market price for OC-BVI’s stock is not available, to test for possible impairment of our investment in OC-BVI, we estimate its fair value through the use of the discounted cash flow method, which relies upon projections of OC-BVI’s operating results, working capital and capital expenditures. The use of this method requires us to estimate OC-BVI’s cash flows from (i) its water supply agreement with the BVI government for its Bar Bay plant (the “Bar Bay agreement”); and (ii) the pending amount awarded by the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeals for the value of the Baughers Bay plant previously transferred by OC-BVI to the BVI government (see further discussion of the Baughers Bay litigation at Item 8. - Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 8). We estimate the cash flows OC-BVI will receive from its Bar Bay agreement by (i) identifying various possible future scenarios for this agreement, which include the cancellation of the agreement after its initial seven-year term, and the exercise by the BVI government of the seven-year extension in the agreement; (ii) estimating the cash flows associated with each possible scenario; and (iii) assigning a probability to each scenario. We similarly estimate the cash flows OC-BVI will receive from the BVI government for the amount due under the ruling by the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeals for the value of the Baughers Bay plant at the date it was transferred to the BVI government by assigning probabilities to different valuation scenarios. The resulting probability-weighted sum represents the expected cash flows, and our best estimate of future cash flows, to be derived by OC-BVI from its Bar Bay agreement and the pending court award. The identification of the possible scenarios for the Bar Bay plant agreement and the Baughers Bay plant valuation, the projections of cash flows for each scenario, and the assignment of relative probabilities to each scenario all represent significant estimates made by us. While we use our best judgment in identifying these possible scenarios, estimating the expected cash flows for these scenarios and assigning relative probabilities to each scenario, these estimates are by their nature highly subjective and are also subject to material change by our management over time based upon new information or changes in circumstances. During the fourth quarter of 2013, after reassessing what we believe will be the future demand for water in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, and the probable sources the BVI government will utilize to meet this demand, we determined it appropriate to modify the projections of cash flows for OC-BVI that we use to estimate the fair value of our investment in OC-BVI by increasing (from those used in prior years) the probabilities assigned to those scenarios that result in a lower supply of water or revenue stream from the Bar Bay plant. Based on these current estimates of OC-BVI’s cash flows and our resulting estimate of the fair value of our investment in OC-BVI, we determined that the carrying value of our investment in OC-BVI exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment loss on this investment of $200,000. The resulting carrying value of our investment in OC-BVI of approximately $6.6 million as of December 31, 2013 assumes that the BVI government will honor its obligations under the Bar Bay agreement and also assumes (on a probability weighted basis) that the BVI government will exercise its option to extend the Bar Bay agreement for seven years beyond its initial term, which expires in 2017. The remaining $6.6 million carrying value of our investment in OC-BVI as of December 31, 2013 exceeds our underlying equity in OC-BVI’s net assets by approximately $2.8 million. We account for this excess as goodwill. The BVI government is OC-BVI’s sole customer and substantially all of OC-BVI’s revenues are generated from its Bar Bay plant. As the Bar Bay agreement matures and OC-BVI receives (or is determined by the court to not be entitled to receive) the pending court award amount assumed due for the value of the Baughers Bay plant, OC-BVI’s expected future cash flows, and therefore its fair value computed under the discounted cash flow method, will decrease. Unless OC-BVI obtains an expansion or other modification of its Bar Bay agreement that results in a significant increase in the estimated future cash flows from its Bar Bay plant, we will be required to record impairment losses in future periods to reduce the carrying value of our investment in OC-BVI to its then current fair value. These impairment losses will, in the aggregate, equal the underlying $2.8 million in goodwill reflected in the carrying value of our investment in OC-BVI and could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and consolidated statement of operations. We have constructed a desalination plant in Bali, Indonesia prior to obtaining water supply agreements for its production. If we are ultimately unable to generate sufficient revenues from this plant we will be required to record an impairment loss against its carrying value. Through our subsidiary, PT Consolidated Water Bali, we have constructed a seawater reverse osmosis (“SWRO”) plant in Nusa Dua, one of the primary tourist areas of Bali, Indonesia. Nusa Dua has a target customer profile consisting of tourist resorts and vacation/luxury residences comparable to our retail service area on Grand Cayman. We believe the water demands of these properties in Nusa Dua will soon exceed the water supplies that can be provided to the area by the local public water utility, and that other areas of Bali will also eventually experience fresh water shortages. However, as SWRO has not been employed to any meaningful extent in Bali, we concluded that to obtain customers in Bali we must first demonstrate the viability of SWRO as well as our capabilities and expertise. Consequently, we elected to construct this plant before obtaining water supply agreements for its production. As of December 31, 2013, the capitalized costs for this plant reflected on our consolidated balance sheet were approximately $3.1 million, and the remaining capital investment for this plant, to expand its existing capacity from 250,000 gallons per day to 750,000 gallons per day, was approximately $1.3 million. If we are ultimately unable to generate sufficient revenues from this plant we will be required to record an impairment loss against its carrying value. Such impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We do not have voting control over our affiliate, OC-BVI. Should our interests and the interests of OC-BVI’s other voting shareholder diverge, the operations of OC-BVI could be adversely affected which could decrease the value of our investment in OC-BVI. We own 43.5% of the equity and 50% of the voting shares of OC-BVI. We and Sage, which owns the remaining 50% of the voting shares, are each entitled to appoint three of the six directors of OC-BVI. If a tie vote of the directors occurs on any matter, the president of the Caribbean Water and Wastewater Association, a regional trade association comprised primarily of government representatives, is entitled to appoint a temporary director to cast the deciding vote. As a result, although we provide operating management and engineering services to OC-BVI, we share the overall management of OC-BVI with Sage and do not fully control its operations. A divergence of our interests and the interests of Sage could adversely affect the operations of OC-BVI and in turn decrease the value of our investment in OC-BVI, in which case we could be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment in OC-BVI. Such an impairment charge would reduce our earnings and could have a significant adverse impact on our result of operations and financial condition. 20 The profitability of our plants is dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs of their construction and operation. The cost estimates we prepare in connection with the construction and operation of our plants are subject to inherent uncertainties. Additionally, the terms of our supply contracts may require us to guarantee the price of water on a per unit basis, subject to certain annual inflation and monthly energy cost adjustments, and to assume the risk that the costs associated with producing this water may be greater than anticipated. Because we base our contracted price of water in part on our estimation of future construction and operating costs, the profitability of our plants is dependent on our ability to estimate these costs accurately. The cost of materials and services and the cost of the delivery of such services may increase significantly after we submit our bid for a plant, which could cause the gross profit and net return on investment for a plant to be less than we anticipated when the bid was made. The profit margins we initially expect to generate from a plant could be further reduced if future operating costs for that plant exceed our estimates of such costs. These future operating costs could be affected by a variety of factors, including lower than anticipated production efficiencies and hydrological conditions at the plant site that differ materially from those we believe would exist at the time we submitted our bid. Any construction and operating costs for our plants that significantly exceed our initial estimates could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 21 A significant portion of our consolidated revenues are derived from two customers. A loss of, or a less favorable relationship with, either of these customers could adversely affect us. Our top two bulk water customers, the Water Authority-Cayman and the Water and Sewerage Corporation of The Bahamas, accounted for approximately 13% and 45%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013. If either of these customers terminate or decide not to renew their contracts with us, or renew such contracts on terms that are less favorable to us, or become unable for financial or other reasons to comply with the terms of our contracts with them, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. Possible future regulatory oversight and control could adversely impact our Belize operations. By Statutory Instrument No. 81 of 2009, the Minister of Public Utilities of the government of Belize published an order, the Public Utility Provider Class Declaration Order, 2009 (the “Order”), which as of May 1, 2009 designated CW-Belize as a public utility provider under the laws of Belize. With this designation, the Public Utilities Commission of Belize (the “PUC”) has the authority to set the rates charged by CW-Belize and to otherwise regulate its activities. On November 1, 2010, CW-Belize received a formal complaint from the PUC alleging that CW-Belize was operating without a license under the terms of the Water Industry Act. CW-Belize applied for this license in December 2010. On July 29, 2011, the PUC issued the San Pedro Public Water Supply Quality and Security Complaint Order (the “Second Order”) which among other things requires that (i) CW-Belize and its customer jointly make a submission to the responsible Minister requesting that the area surrounding CW-Belize’s seawater abstraction wells be designated a forest reserve or national park and be designated a Controlled Area under section 58 of the Water Industry Act, (ii) CW-Belize submit an operations manual for CW-Belize’s desalination plant to the PUC for approval, (iii) CW-Belize and its customer modify the water supply agreement between the parties to (a) include new water quality parameters included in the Order and (b) cap the current exclusive water supply arrangement in the agreement at a maximum of 450,000 gallons per day, (iv) CW-Belize keep a minimum number of replacement seawater RO membranes in stock at all times and (v) CW-Belize take possession of and reimburse the PUC for certain equipment which the PUC purchased from a third-party in late 2010. CW-Belize has applied for declaratory judgment and has been granted a temporary injunction to stay the enforcement of the Second Order by the PUC until such time as the matter could be heard by the Belize courts. The initial hearing on this matter was conducted on October 30 and 31, 2012 with an additional hearing on November 29, 2012. The ruling on this case is pending. An unfavorable ruling on the Order or the Second Order could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Our operations are affected by tourism and are subject to seasonal fluctuations which could affect the demand for our water. Our operations are affected by the levels of tourism and are subject to seasonal variations in our service areas. Demand for our water in the Cayman Islands, Belize, Bimini and The Bahamas is affected by variations in the level of tourism and local weather, primarily rainfall. Tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists’ home countries, primarily the United States and Europe, terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof, and increased costs of fuel and airfares. We normally sell more water during the first and second quarters, when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less, than in the third and fourth quarters. A downturn in tourism or greater than expected rainfall in the locations we serve could adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and results of operations. 22 We may have difficulty accomplishing our growth strategy within and outside of our current operating areas. Our expansion both within our current operating areas and into new areas involves significant risks, including, but not limited to, the following: • regulatory risks, including government relations difficulties, local regulations, currency controls and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; • receiving and maintaining necessary permits, licenses and approvals; • political instability, reliance on local economies, environmental problems, shortages of materials, immigration restrictions and limited skilled labor; • risks related to development of new operations, including inaccurate assessment of the demand for water, engineering difficulties and inability to begin operations as scheduled; and • risks relating to greater competition in these new territories, including the ability of our competitors to gain or retain market share by reducing prices. Even if we successfully expand our operations, we may have difficulty managing our growth. We cannot assure you that any new operations within or outside of our current operating areas will attain or maintain profitability or that the results from these new operations will not adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Production shortfalls under any of our bulk supply contracts could result in penalties or cancellation of the contract. Our bulk water supply contracts require us to deliver specified minimum volumes of water. Membrane fouling or other technical problems could occur at any of our plants, and if we are unable to meet the production minimums due to such operating issues, we could be in technical default of the supply contract and subject to various adverse consequences, including financial penalties or cancellation of the contract. Our operations could be harmed by hurricanes or tropical storms. A hurricane or tropical storm could cause major damage to our equipment and properties and the properties of our customers, including the large tourist properties in our areas of operation. For example, in September 2004 Hurricane Ivan caused significant damage to our plants and our customers’ properties, which adversely affected our revenues. Any future damage could cause us to lose use of our equipment and properties and incur additional repair costs. Damage to our customers’ properties and the adverse impact on tourism could result in a decrease in water demand. A hurricane or tropical storm could also disrupt the delivery of equipment and supplies, including electricity, necessary to our operations. These and other possible effects of hurricanes or tropical storms could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Contamination of our processed water may cause disruption in our services and adversely affect our revenues. Our processed water may become contaminated by natural occurrences and by inadvertent or intentional human interference, including acts of terrorism. In the event that a portion of our processed water is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the supply of water until we are able to install treatment equipment or substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water production source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat a contaminated source of plant feed water through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. An inability by us to substitute processed water from an uncontaminated water source or to adequately treat the contaminated plant feed water in a cost-effective manner may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Potential government decisions, actions and regulations could negatively affect our operations. We are subject to the local regulations of the Cayman Islands, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, and The Bahamas, all of which are subject to change. Any government that regulates our operations may issue legislation or adopt new regulations, including but not limited to: • restricting foreign ownership (by us); • providing for the expropriation of our assets by the government; • providing for nationalization of public utilities by the government; • providing for different water quality standards; • unilaterally changing or renegotiating our licenses and agreements; • restricting the transfer of U.S. currency; or • causing currency exchange fluctuations/devaluations or making changes in tax laws. As new laws and regulations are issued, we may be required to modify our operations and business strategy, which we may be unable to do in a cost-effective manner. Failure by us to comply with applicable regulations could result in the loss of our licenses or authorizations to operate, the assessment of penalties or fines, or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 23 The rates we charge our retail customers in the Cayman Islands are subject to regulation. If we are unable to obtain government approval of our requests for rate increases, or if approved rate increases are untimely or inadequate to cover our projected expenses, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Under our exclusive retail license in the Cayman Islands, with the exception of annual inflation-related and monthly energy-related adjustments, we cannot increase the base rates we charge our retail customers without prior approval from the Cayman Islands government. However, the expenses we incur in supplying water under this license may increase due to circumstances that were unforeseen at the time we entered into the license. We may incur additional costs in attempting to obtain government approval of any rate increase, which may be granted on a delayed basis, if at all. Failure to obtain timely and adequate rate increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We rely on the efforts of key employees. Our failure to retain these employees could adversely affect our results of operations. Our success depends upon the abilities of our executive officers. In particular, the loss of the services of Fredrick W. McTaggart, our President and Chief Executive Officer, could be detrimental to our operations and our continued success. Mr. McTaggart has an employment agreement expiring on December 31, 2016. Each year, the term of this agreement may be extended for an additional year. However, we cannot guarantee that Mr. McTaggart will continue to work for us during the term of his agreement or will enter into any extensions thereof. We are exposed to credit risk through our relationships with several customers. We are subject to credit risk posed by possible defaults in payment by our bulk water customers in the Cayman Islands, Belize, the British Virgin Islands and The Bahamas and by possible defaults in payment by the Water Authority-Cayman on their loans payable to us. Adverse economic conditions affecting, or financial difficulties of, those parties could impair their ability to pay us or cause them to delay payment. We depend on these parties to pay us on a timely basis. Our outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. Any delay or default in payment could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. We are exposed to the risk of variations in currency exchange rates. Although we report our results in United States dollars, the majority of our revenues are earned in other currencies. Although many of these of the currencies have been fixed to the United States dollar for more than 20 years, other currencies (e.g. the Mexico peso, Indonesian rupiah and the euro) are not. We do not employ hedging strategies against the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with conducting business in foreign currencies while reporting in United States dollars. If any of the fixed exchange rates becomes a floating exchange rate, or the other currencies in which we conduct business depreciate significantly against the United State dollar, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may enter new markets in the future in which we do not have a contractual commitment for our products or existing customers. Our strategy contemplates potential entry into new markets (such as Mexico, Indonesia and other countries) where we believe a demand for potable water exists beyond the current supply of potable water in those markets. We may incur significant business development expenses in the pursuit of new markets prior to obtaining a contract for services in these markets, and such expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. We may decide to enter such markets by building new reverse osmosis desalination plants before we have obtained a contract for the sale of water produced by the new plant or before we have established a customer base for the water produced by the new plant. If after completing such plant we are unable to obtain a contract or sufficient number of customers for the plant, we may be unable to recover the cost of our investment in the plant, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We may not pay dividends in the future. If dividends are paid, they may be in lesser amounts than past dividends. Our shareholders may receive dividends out of legally available funds if, and when, they are declared by our Board of Directors. We have paid dividends in the past, but may cease to do so at any time. We may incur increased operating or development expenses or capital requirements or additional indebtedness in the future that may restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends. We may also be restricted from paying dividends in the future due to restrictions imposed by applicable corporate laws, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, covenants contained in our financing agreements, and other factors considered by our Board of Directors. We may not continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, they may not be in amounts similar to past dividends. Service of process and enforcement of legal proceedings commenced against us in the United States may be difficult to obtain. We are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and most of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, 10 of our 16 directors and executive officers reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to affect service of process within the United States upon us and such other persons, or to enforce judgments obtained against such persons in United States courts, and bring any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts or jurisdictions located outside of the United States, rights predicated upon the United States securities laws. 24 Based on the advice of our Cayman Islands legal counsel, we believe there is no reciprocal statutory enforcement of foreign judgments between the United States and the Cayman Islands, and that foreign judgments originating from the United States are not directly enforceable in the Cayman Islands. A prevailing party in a United States proceeding against us or our officers or directors would have to initiate a new proceeding in the Cayman Islands using the United States judgment as evidence of the party’s claim. A prevailing party could rely on the summary judgment procedures available in the Cayman Islands, subject to available defenses in the Cayman Islands courts, including, but not limited to, the lack of competent jurisdiction in the United States courts, lack of due service of process in the United States proceeding and the possibility that enforcement or recognition of the United States judgment would be contrary to the public policy of the Cayman Islands. Depending on the nature of damages awarded, civil liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (or the Securities Act), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or the Exchange Act), for original actions instituted outside the Cayman Islands may or may not be enforceable. For example, a United States judgment awarding remedies unobtainable in any legal action in the courts of the Cayman Islands, such as treble damages, would likely not be enforceable under any circumstances. The relatively low trading volume of our stock may adversely impact your sales of our shares. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the average daily trading volume of our common shares was approximately 87,000 shares, a much lower trading volume than that of many other companies listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time. This presence in turn depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. As a consequence of the limited volume of trading in our common shares, an investor in our stock may have difficulty selling a large number of our common shares in the manner, or at the price, that might be attainable if our common shares were more actively traded. We are subject to anti-takeover measures that may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company. Classified Board of Directors. We have a classified Board of Directors that consists of three groups. Only one group of directors is elected each year. Our classified Board may increase the length of time necessary for an acquirer to change the composition of a majority of directors in order to gain control of our Board. Option Deed. Our Board of Directors has adopted an Option Deed that is intended to improve the bargaining position of our Board of Directors in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire our outstanding stock. Under the terms of the Option Deed, a stock purchase right is attached to each of our current or future outstanding common shares issued prior to the time the purchase rights become exercisable, are redeemed or expire. The purchase rights will become exercisable only if an individual or group has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, or announced a tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in such individual or group acquiring beneficial ownership of 20% or more of our outstanding common shares. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the rights will entitle every holder of our common shares, other than the acquirer, to purchase our shares or shares of our successor on terms that would likely be economically dilutive to the acquirer. Under certain circumstances, instead of common shares, our Board of Directors may issue cash or debt securities. Our Board of Directors, however, has the power to amend the Option Deed so that it does not apply to a particular acquisition proposal or to redeem the rights for a nominal value before they become exercisable. These features will likely encourage an acquirer to negotiate with our Board of Directors before commencing a tender offer or to condition a tender offer on our Board of Directors taking action to prevent the purchase rights from becoming exercisable. In March 2007, our Board extended the expiration date of the Option Deed through July 2017. As a result of these anti-takeover measures, we could deter efforts to make changes to, or exercise control over, current management. In addition, our shareholders may not have an opportunity to sell their common shares to a potential acquirer at the acquirer’s offering price, which is typically at a premium to market price.
