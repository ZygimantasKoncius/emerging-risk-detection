Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are measures of our historical or future performance, financial position or cash flows that contain adjustments that exclude or include amounts that are included or excluded, as the case may be, from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP in our financial statements. Examples of our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are: operating cost base, iv Table of Contents underlying pre-tax profit, underlying cost/income ratio, average active equity and underlying pre-tax return on equity. For descriptions of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures and the adjustments made to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to obtain them, please refer to Note [27] to our consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference herein.

Item 2: Offer Statistics and Expected Timetable Not required because this document is filed as an annual report. Item 3: Key Information Selected Financial Data We have derived the data we present in the tables below from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years presented. You should read all of the data in the tables below together with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 18: Financial Statements and the information we provide in Item 5: Operating and Financial Review and Prospects. Except where we have indicated otherwise, we have prepared all of the consolidated financial information in this document in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (which we refer to as U.S. GAAP). Our group division and segment data come from our management reporting systems and are not necessarily based on, or prepared in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. For a discussion of the major differences between our management reporting systems and our consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP, see Item 5: Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Results of Operations by Segment. In reading our income statement data, you should note that the financial accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP for changes in German income tax rates results in a negative impact on our results of operations in the years 2001 through 2005. These tax rate changes, which were enacted in 2000 and 1999, were:  significant reductions, effective in 1999 and 2001, in the corporate income tax rate; and  the reduction to zero, effective in 2002, of the tax rate applicable to capital gains on the sale of certain equity securities. These reductions in tax rates resulted in significant decreases in our deferred taxes payable, with a corresponding reduction in our income tax expense for 2000. In the years 2001 through 2005, when we sold securities that had accumulated deferred tax provisions within other comprehensive income, we reversed such deferred tax provisions, which resulted in a significant increase in income tax expense. We more fully explain the financial accounting treatment of these tax rate changes in Item 5: Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Effects of 1999/2000 German Tax Reform Legislation and Accounting for Income Taxes. Due to sales of equity securities for which there were accumulated deferred tax provisions in other comprehensive income, it was necessary to reverse  544 million,  120 million,  215 million,  2.8 billion and  995 million of those provisions as income tax expense in 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During these years, our net income was  3.5 billion,  2.5 billion,  1.4 billion,  397 million and  167 million, respectively. Without the additional income tax expense we describe above, and also without the cumulative effect of accounting changes we describe below, our net income would have been  4.1 billion,  2.6 billion,  1.4 billion,  3.2 billion and  1.4 billion in 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We recommend that you consider our net income excluding the impact of the changes in income tax rates and the reversing effect and the cumulative effect of 1 Table of Contents accounting changes when you compare the years 2001 through 2005 to one another and to earlier and future periods. In 2003, as a result of the application of FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46), we recorded a  140 million gain, net of tax, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles in our Consolidated Statement of Income. Also in 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity (SFAS 150) and recorded an after-tax gain of  11 million. The requirements of SFAS 150 also resulted in a reduction in shareholders equity of  2.9 billion during 2003. Upon adoption of the requirements of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142) as of January 1, 2002, we discontinued the amortization of goodwill with a net carrying amount of  8.7 billion and we recognized a  37 million tax-free gain as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles in our Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, in 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133) and in that year recorded an expense of  207 million, after tax, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles in our Consolidated Statement of Income. 2 Table of Contents Income Statement Data in  m. and U.S.$ m.

We describe these changes and their effects in Item 5: Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Effects of 1999/2000 German Tax Reform Legislation and Accounting for Income Taxes. The table at the bottom of this page presents these figures excluding these effects. 3 Net income as a percentage of adjusted average month-end shareholders equity. We calculate this adjusted measure of our return on average total shareholders equity to make it easier to compare us to our competitors. We refer to this adjusted measure as our post-tax return on average active equity. This is not a measure of performance provided for in U.S. GAAP, however, and you should not compare our ratio to other companies ratios without considering the differences in calculation of these ratios. The items for which we adjust our ratio result primarily from our portfolio of shareholdings in publicly-listed industrial companies. We have held most of our larger participations for over 20 years, and are reducing these holdings over time. For further information on our industrial holdings, see 
