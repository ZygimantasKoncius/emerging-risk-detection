D. Risk Factors" for more information about the risks facing the Company. C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc. As a high-technology company, AIXTRON maintains a strong research and revelopment infrastructure, with significant resources devoted to R&D projects. AIXTRON's R&D activities are critical for the Company's long-term strategy to maintain its position as one of the world's leading provider of gas-phase deposition equipment for the manufacture of complex device structures for the semiconductor industry. AIXTRON's R&D organization works closely with its own global sales and service organization to develop systems, tailored to customers' individual needs. AIXTRON maintains its own R&D laboratories in Aachen and Herzogenrath in Germany and in Sunnyvale, California. These in-house laboratories are equipped with AIXTRON systems for researching new equipment and processes, as well as for producing reference samples of semiconductor materials. As part of the R&D efforts employed, AIXTRON regularly collaborates with many 28 well-known universities and research centers worldwide and participates in numerous government and European Union-funded development projects. Key R&D Information 2007 2006 2005 R&D expenses (million €) 26.5 23.9 30.5 R&D expenses, % of sales 12 % 14 % 22 % R&D employees (period average) 210 181 188 R&D employees, % of total headcount (period average) 36 % 32 % 37 % The absolute increase in R&D expense in 2007 compared to 2006 was largely due to increased development activities and the consequent increase in headcount of temporary and permanent staff, higher cost for testing and consumable materials and increased amortization charges year on year. Next Generation Non-Volatile Memory Development AIXTRON continues to participate in the European Commission-funded CHEMAPH (Chemical Vapor Deposition of Chalcogenide Materials for Phase-change Memories- EU IST Project) project. The scope of the project is aimed at the development of chalcogenide-based phase change materials. The consortium carrying out this study consists of three academic and three industrial partners from five European countries, namely CNR (National Lab MDM-INFM), Italy; ST Microelectronics, Italy; SAFC Hitech, United Kingdom; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Spain; Vilnius University, Lithuania; and AIXTRON AG, Germany. Phase-change memories (PCM) are some of the most promising candidates for the next-generation of improved non-volatile memory structures, beyond flash memory. The project aims at demonstrating the feasibility of a film manufacturing process based on metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). This technique is known to enable the production of thin films with superior quality compared to those obtained by the currently most used methodology, known as sputtering, a physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique. AIXTRON's participation in this project is expected to result in the more rapid development and refinement of the range of its MOCVD systems for chalcogenide phase change materials. Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED) for lighting applications As part of a German Ministry of Science and Technology (BMBF) program (OLED 2015), the ministry has committed € 100 million, over a 5 year period as support for the development of organic light emitting diodes (OLED) for lighting applications. The 33 partners within the OLED initiative, including AIXTRON AG, are expected to collectively contribute the equivalent of € 500 million to achieve the technical targets related to the development of OLEDs for lighting applications. The primary stated scope of the initiative is the creation and introduction of new OLED lighting technology into the market. As part of the OLED 2015 funded initiative, AIXTRON participates in a specific R&D projectOrganic Phosphorescent lights for Applications in the lighting market 2008 ("OPAL 2008"), with the Company's Organic Vapor Phase Deposition (OVPD®) technology platform in a consortium together with OSRAM Opto Semiconductors GmbH, Philips GmbH, BASF Future Business GmbH and Applied Materials, Inc. (formerly Applied Films). The final goal of OPAL 2008 is the development of an OLED production technology capable of manufacturing a high performance white OLED device at a target cost of a few Euro cents per cm2. To reach this target, the individual research activities of all partners within this group will be coordinated to maximize the feasible development synergy effects. The specialized organic materials required will be developed by BASF Future Business GmbH. The device architecture for the lighting modules and the adapted OLED processing technology will be developed by OSRAM Opto Semiconductors GmbH and Philips GmbH. AIXTRON's contribution to the project will be to improve the production capabilities of the OVPD® process by designing appropriate equipment for such OLED devices. The research will be carried out in Aachen, Germany at the Philips production site in Aachen Rothe Erde where a prototype OVPD® system is already installed and running. Additional scientific support is provided by RWTH Aachen University. White LEDs on silicon as an inexpensive substrate for lighting applications AIXTRON participates in a UK Department of Business technology program, which aims at developing low-cost LEDs for solid-state lighting based on GaN structures deposited on large area Silicon substrates using AIXTRON's MOCVD technology. 29 Next generation CMOS circuits with III-V based Transistors AIXTRON participates in a research project together with academic and industrial partners, namely IBM Research (Switzerland), ST Microelectronics (France), NXP Semiconductors (Belgium), National Center of Scientific Research (Greece), Interuniversitair Micro-Electronica Centrum ("IMEC") (Belgium), Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique ("LETI") (France), University of Glasgow (United Kingdom) and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium) aimed at developing a dual-channel CMOS technology comprising high channel mobility Germanium (Ge) pMOS and III-V compound semiconductor based nMOS transistors co-integrated on the same complex engineered silicon substrate. This approach potentially delivers a high performance boost effect as an option for the 22nm technology node for the nano-electronics industry. D. Trend Information For information about trends, see "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsOverview," "Significant Factors," "Operating Results," and "Liquidity and Capital resources." Future Strategic Positioning The development of deposition technology for highly complex materials is expected to remain the Company's core competency and competitive advantage, upon which AIXTRON plans to further expand its established product portfolio into existing and future markets. Systems for Compound Semiconductor Manufacturing AIXTRON expects to maintain or expand its global market leadership and strong competitive positioning in the market for MOCVD systems over the coming years, and aims to continue to maintain an estimated market share of at least 60%. Market research company VLSI Research, Inc. has estimated this market to be valued at U.S.$290 million by the end of 2008 (2007 estimate: U.S.$220 million). However, the relatively small market size and the high market concentration on two internationally operating MOCVD system providers may be detrimental to further expansion objectives of AIXTRON's market leadership. Systems for Silicon Semiconductor Manufacturing AIXTRON expects that the principal AIXTRON equipment market driver for silicon semiconductor applications will be memory applications such as NAND Flash and DRAM, and that an emerging demand for new complex material solutions, such as high-k dielectrics, could potentially extend the Company's available market as the silicon industry moves to replace the incumbent materials currently used in silicon semiconductor applications. The Company believes it is well positioned to serve the silicon semiconductor industry in a number of niche market applications with customized CVD, ALD, and AVD® technology deposition systems for the production of specialized applications such as gate stacks, memory capacitors, and MEMS, amongst others. VLSI Research Inc. has estimated the silicon systems market niches AIXTRON addresses (tungsten silicide CVD, ALD and AVD® systems for the production of specialized applications such as gate stacks and capacitors) to be valued at U.S.$277 million by the end of 2008 (2007 estimate: U.S.$231 million). Systems for Organic Semiconductor Manufacturing AIXTRON plans to drive forward with its strategy to introduce its OVPD® and PVPD technologies to a broader OLED display and lighting market. AIXTRON expects to achieve a share of at least 3% in the small molecule (SM) OLEDs deposition equipment market, estimated by Display Search to be valued at U.S.$240 million by the end of 2008 (2007 estimate: U.S.$226 million). As with all emerging technologies, there is an element of risk associated with the timing of AIXTRON's OVPD® and PVPD technology being adopted by the market. E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2007, the Company had entered into purchase commitments with suppliers in the amount of € 49.2 million (December 31, 2006: € 23.4 million; December 31, 2005: € 10.7 million) for purchases within the next 12 months. Commitments for capital expenditures at December 31, 2007 were € 2.8 million (December 31, 2006: € 44 thousand; December 31, 2005: € 0 thousand). 30 Contingencies The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, none of which management believes are material. The Company grants some customers advance payment guarantees, which are for a limited period of time. Management does not expect that such matters will have a material effect on the Company's net assets, results of operations and financial position. See also "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsTabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations". F. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations In the ordinary course of business, AIXTRON's primary contractual obligations regarding cash involve purchase commitments, operating lease commitments and capital expenditures. The following table summarizes contractual obligations for future cash outflows as of December 31, 2007: Payments due by period (€ million) (as of December 31, 2007) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years (€ millions) Long-Term Debt Obligations 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Finance lease commitments 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Operating lease commitments 8.82 1.64 5.21 1.48 0.49 Purchase commitments 49.22 48.05 1.17 0.00 0.00 Total contractual obligations 58.04 49.69 6.38 1.48 0.49 At December 31, 2007, the Company's commitments for capital expenditures were € 2.84 million (2006: € 44,000). No obligations for funding of pension plans existed at December 31, 2007. The Company outsources a substantial portion of the manufacturing of its operations to third party suppliers. As the Company's products are technologically complex, the lead times for purchases from its suppliers can vary up to six months. Principally, but not exclusively, contractual commitments are made for specific customer orders or forecast orders. In some circumstances, where contractual commitments to suppliers for multiple modules or systems reduce the Company's purchase prices per module or system, purchase commitments may be made against anticipated demand. For the majority of purchase commitments, the Company has flexible delivery schedules depending on the market conditions, which allow the Company, to a certain extent, to delay delivery beyond originally planned delivery schedule estimates, if necessary. The Company leases certain office and plant facilities, office furniture and motor vehicles under various operating leases. Regarding most of the lease commitments for office and plant facilities the Company has options to renew the leasing contracts. The leases typically run for a period between one and 15 years. None of the leases includes contingent rentals. Item 6: Directors, Senior Management and Employees A. Directors and Senior Management In compliance with German lawthe German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz)governing a stock corporation such as the Company, AIXTRON has a Supervisory Board (Aufsichtsrat) and an Executive Board (Vorstand). The two boards are separated and no individual may simultaneously be a member of both boards. The Executive Board is responsible for managing the Company's business in accordance with applicable laws, AIXTRON's Articles of Association and the Bylaws of the Executive Board, and as such it represents the Company in its dealings with third parties. The Supervisory Board appoints and removes the members of the Executive Board.

The Executive Board is required to respect the rights of shareholders to be treated on an equal basis and receive equal information. The Executive Board is also required to ensure that appropriate risk management mechanisms are established and that internal monitoring systems are employed. Supervisory Board The principal function of AIXTRON's Supervisory Board is to supervise the activities and actions of the Executive Board without being involved in the conduct of day-to-day transactions. The Supervisory Board has comprehensive monitoring functions and is also responsible for appointing and removing the members of the Executive Board. Although the Supervisory Board may not make management decisions, certain types of transactions require its prior consent. The rules of procedure of the Executive Board, which were approved by the Supervisory Board, provide that some affairs, operations and major transactions, such as large capital expenditure items, require the prior consent of the Supervisory Board. Additionally, the Executive Board is required to regularly report to the Supervisory Board on current business operations and future business planning. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the respective chairman of the Supervisory Board committees participate in numerous conference calls and personal meetings with the Executive Board to keep abreast of the Company's business and its commercial activities. All of the Company's present Supervisory Board members were elected by its shareholders. The shareholders may remove any member of the Supervisory Board they have elected in a general meeting by a simple majority of the votes cast by the shareholders in a general meeting. The members of the Supervisory Board are each elected for a term expiring at the end of the annual general shareholders' meeting after the fourth fiscal year following the year in which the Supervisory Board was elected. Supervisory Board members may be re-elected and are not subject to a compulsory retirement age. The Company's Articles of Association establish the compensation of the Supervisory Board members.

Compensation In a resolution passed during the annual general meeting on May 18, 2005 and following the respective amendment of the Company's bylaws, AIXTRON modified the Supervisory Board's compensation, in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code. Individual members of the Supervisory Board receive € 18,000 per year. The Chairman receives € 54,000 per year, and the Deputy Chairman receives € 27,000 per year. Supervisory Board members receive in the aggregate a variable compensation of 1% of the Company's retained earnings, less an amount corresponding to 4% of the paid-in contributions to the share capital. The Chairman receives 6/17, the Deputy Chairman 3/17, and each other member of the Supervisory Board 2/17 of the variable compensation. The Company limits variable compensation to four times the fixed compensation per Supervisory Board member. In addition, Supervisory Board members receive an attendance fee of € 1,500 for attending committee meetings, with the Chairman receiving twice that amount. The total annual attendance fee per Supervisory Board member is limited to one and a half times that person's fixed compensation. Executive Board remuneration consists of three components: fixed remuneration including allowances for private pension provision, a variable bonus, and stock-based remuneration. In the Executive Board contracts of employment, an annual income is stipulated for the fixed remuneration component. The variable bonus is aligned to the consolidated net income for the year. As far as stock-based remuneration is concerned, the Executive Board members participate in the AIXTRON stock option plans. The appropriateness of the above-mentioned payments is reviewed every 3 years. The fixed remuneration component is non-performance-related and is paid out on a monthly basis (13 times a year) as a salary. Additional payments in kind are made, mainly consisting of company car usage and premiums for insurance policies. The variable remuneration is paid from an "accrued internal bonus", defined as 10% of the modified consolidated net income for the year concerned and limited to no more than € 6.5 million in total. In 2007, € 1,207,478 (2006: € 411,000) is payable. The modified consolidated net income for the year is obtained from the Company's audited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, less a consolidated loss carryforward figure and those amounts that are to be allocated to earnings reserves in the Annual Financial Statements of AIXTRON AG by law or in accordance with the Articles of Association. The consolidated loss carryforwards are obtained from consolidated net losses from previous years, less consolidated net income from subsequent fiscal years. Loss carryforwards from fiscal years before January 1, 2006 are not taken into account. AIXTRON and its affiliates paid € 2.64 million aggregate cash compensation during the 2007 fiscal year (2006: € 1.67 million) to three members (four members through November 2007) of the Executive Board for services in all capacities and € 0.27 million to six members of the Supervisory Board (2006: € 0.18 million). The tables below set forth these amounts by individual members of the Executive and Supervisory boards, respectively.

The allowances for pension provision, paid by AIXTRON and included in the fixed remuneration figure listed above, are paid into an insurance contract with a benevolent fund. The Company's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans reflects commitments to two former members of the Executive Board of AIXTRON AG. As of December 2007, this resulted in pension provisions totaling € 0.88 million (2006: € 0.98 million). C. Board Practices See "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesSupervisory Board" and "Executive Board." No additional benefits are generally paid to the Company's Executive Board Members upon termination of their employment contracts. If the employment contract of any of the Company's Executive Board Members is terminated without notice for good cause on the part of the Executive Board Member and for which he has to bear responsibility, the entitlement to the profit sharing bonus lapses from the time that the termination becomes effective. Audit Committee According to Article 16.1 of AIXTRON's Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board is authorized and, if prescribed by law, required to form committees of its members. The Audit Committee primarily deals with matters such as accounting, risk management, the control system, the auditors' mandate, identification of areas to be audited, auditors' fee arrangements, while at the same time ensuring the necessary independence of the auditors.

As of December 31, 2007, members of the Company's Supervisory Board, a group of six persons, indirectly or directly, held 9,503,912 AIXTRON ordinary shares. Pursuant to Section 15a of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG), in effect during the reporting period, members of the Executive and Supervisory Boards were required to disclose significant purchases or sales of shares of AIXTRON. In fiscal year 2007, Former Executive Board Member Dr. William Elder reported he had sold 104,860 shares he received from executing his stock options, and Executive Board member Dr. Bernd Schulte reported he had sold 20,650 shares he received from executing his stock options, Supervisory Board member Dr. Holger Jürgensen reported he had sold through his ownership stake in CAMMA GmbH 1,612,500 shares of AIXTRON. Employee Bonds and Options Employee Bonds As of December 31, 2007, no bonds were outstanding and there are no liabilities from convertible bonds (2006: € 3 thousand). During 2007, 2006 and 2005 no bonds were converted into common stock. In November 1997, the Company issued 6% convertible bonds to employees, due November 2007, with a principal amount of € 320 thousand, interest payable annually in arrears. The remaining outstanding convertible bonds, amounting to € 3 thousand expired in November 2007 without being exercised. As part of the acquisition of Genus, Inc, the Company assumed liabilities from convertible bonds at total par value of € 4,807 thousand (US$6,450 thousand) and at an interest rate of 7%. The convertible bonds were issued by Genus, Inc. in August 2002 and had a maturity term of three years. The option of conversion into Genus stock shares was changed, at the date of the Genus acquisition, into a right to convert each Genus stock share into a 0.51 AIXTRON ADS. For this purpose the required AIXTRON ADS were contributed into the trust as part of the acquisition (see note 22). In August 2005, the convertible bonds and the interest incurred since March 13, 2005 were completely settled by way of conversion into AIXTRON ADS. In this conversion 2,383,920 ADS from the trust were issued to the holder of the convertible bonds. As a result no liability from the Genus convertible bond existed at December 31, 2005 or December 31, 2006 or December 31, 2007. As part of the acquisition of Genus, liabilities for additional options over 60,409 ADS were assumed. The options expired on May 13, 2006 without being exercised. Share Option Programs Share Options are part of the variable compensation employed as a long term incentive to retain the management and other key employees. Based on the Company's stock option program approved by the shareholder's meeting on May 22, 2007, a total of 644,336 AIXTRON AG bearer shares were exercised by employees in 2007 (no options 38 were executed in 2006 or 2005) and 642,539 AIXTRON AG American Depositary Shares (ADS) were exercised by employees in 2007 (2006: 39,540 ADS; 2005: 41,226 ADS). Under the AIXTRON Stock Option Plan 2007, 759,100 share options were granted to management of AIXTRON AG and members of the management of affiliated companies, as well as to employees of AIXTRON AG and of affiliated companies. 50% of the granted options may be exercised after a waiting period of not less than two years, an additional 25% of the granted options may be exercised after three years and the remaining 25% of the granted options may be exercised after at least four years. The options expire 10 years after they have been granted. 2007 AIXTRON ordinary shares Dec. 31, 2007 Exercise Allocation Dec. 31, 2006 stock options 4,327,882 644,336 759,100 4,379,711 underlying shares 5,003,027 644,336 759,100 5,060,565 AIXTRON ADS Dec. 31, 2007 Exercise Dec. 31, 2006 stock options 247,009 658,371 994,469 underlying shares 247,009 658,371 994,469 As part of the Genus, Inc. acquisition, completed in March 2005, a trust for the employee stock options of the AIXTRON Inc. group employees was established, into which an appropriate number of AIXTRON AG ADSs were deposited.

As of December 31, 2007, 127 registered ADS holders (excluding DTC) held 1,516,128 ADSs representing 1.68% of total shares outstanding.

The Company is not aware of any unasserted claims that may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operation.

Memorandum and Articles of Association Copies of the Company's Articles of Association are publicly available from the commercial register (Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht) in Aachen, Germany, under the entry number HRB 7002. An English translation of the Company's Articles of Association as of May 22, 2007 can be found in Exhibit 1.1. According to article 2 of AIXTRON's Articles of Association, the purpose of the Company is the manufacture and sale of products, as well as research and development and services for the implementation of semiconductor technologies and other physicochemical technologies, particularly those bearing the AIXTRON trademark. The Company is authorized to conduct all transactions suitable for promoting the Company's purpose indirectly and directly. The Company may establish branch offices in Germany and abroad, may acquire equity interests in other companies in Germany 42 and abroad, as well as purchase or establish such companies. The Company may outsource all or part of its operations to affiliates. With respect to Items 10.B.2 through 10.B.10, see "Description of the AIXTRON Ordinary Shares" and "Description of the American Depositary Shares" in the Registration Statement on Form F-4 (Reg. No. 333-122624) filed on February 8, 2005. Regarding the "Description of the AIXTRON Ordinary Shares, incorporated by reference, please note that meanwhile (i) the acquisition of Genus, Inc. has been completed and (ii) in particular the following additional changes have occurred: The amount of the stated share capital of AIXTRON has changed and amounts to € 90,444,213 as of December 31, 2007. It is divided into 90,444,213 no-par value bearer shares. Shareholders are not entitled to be issued a share certificate representing their share(s). As a result of the Transparenzrichtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz (Transparency Directive Implementation Act) which entered into force on January 20, 2007, the transmittal of information to shareholders by electronic means is, inter alia, subject to the approval of the General Meeting (see § 30b (3) no. 1 of the Wertpapierhandelsgesetz (German Securities Trading Act). Therefore, the General Meeting decided May 22, 2007 on the amendment of the Articles of Association. Article 3 has been amended to now read as follows: Article 3 "Notices and Information 1.The Company's notices will be published in the electronic Bundesanzeiger (Federal Gazette), unless otherwise stipulated by law. 2.Information to holders of admitted securities of the Company may also be transmitted electronically." Corporate Governance AIXTRON's Declaration of Conformity with the recommendations of the Government Commission of the German Corporate Governance Code (Regierungskommission Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex) was last updated in March 2008 and states the Company's complete compliance with the Corporate Governance Code. It is posted in the "Investor Relations" section of AIXTRON's website at www.aixtron.com. Sarbanes-Oxley Act Requirements and NASDAQ Rules AIXTRON's American Depositary Shares were listed for trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market in connection with the Genus transaction in March 2005. As a result, AIXTRON is subject to various requirements under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the "NASDAQ Rules"). To facilitate the Company's compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and the NASDAQ Rules, AIXTRON has taken various steps, including the establishment of a Disclosure Committee that is responsible for reviewing and approving its public disclosures, and a review of its Audit Committee policies. AIXTRON has also introduced procedures to provide the senior management certifications mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These procedures and certifications are a basis on which AIXTRON's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer may provide such certifications. AIXTRON has also implemented procedures for handling complaints related to accounting practices and introduced a Code of Ethics. In conjunction with the its annual report for the year ending December 31, 2007, the Company is required to include a report from its management relating to its evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, as required pursuant to Section 404 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act, see Item 15 in this annual report on Form 20-F. Companies listed on NASDAQ are subject to the provisions of NASDAQ Rule 4350 ("Rule 4350"), among other NASDAQ Rules. In general, pursuant to Rule 4350(a)(1), as amended, a "foreign private issuer" such as AIXTRON may follow its home country law and practice in lieu of the corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ. A foreign private issuer that elects to follow home country practice in lieu of Rule 4350 must provide a written statement from an independent counsel in the issuer's home country certifying 43 that the non-conforming practices are not prohibited by the home country's law. AIXTRON provided such a written statement in connection with its March 2005 listing application. A foreign private issuer that follows a home country practice in lieu of one or more provisions of Rule 4350 is also required to disclose in its annual reports filed with the SEC each requirement of Rule 4350 that it does not follow and describe the home country practice followed by the issuer in lieu of such requirement. AIXTRON intends generally to comply with applicable German corporate governance practice rather than certain of the requirements of Rule 4350. The requirements of Rule 4350 that AIXTRON is not following and its non-conforming practices in lieu thereof are as follows: Rule 4350(b)(1)(A) requires distribution to shareholders of copies of an annual report containing audited financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries. The report shall be distributed to shareholders a reasonable period of time prior to the company's annual meeting of shareholders and shall be filed with NASDAQ at the time it is distributed to shareholders. Under the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) annual and interim reports are not automatically distributed to shareholders by a company. However, AIXTRON is required to make its annual reports available to the shareholders at the Company's offices and to mail such reports to shareholders upon request. AIXTRON files its annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, under the deposit agreement relating to AIXTRON's ADSs, the Company has agreed to provide annual reports to the depositary bank (JPMorgan Chase Bank) so that the depositary bank may arrange for distribution of such information to holders of AIXTRON's ADSs; Rule 4350(c) requires, among other things, that a majority of a company's board of directors must be comprised of independent directors (as defined in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200) and sets forth certain voting and independence requirements with respect to the nomination of board members and the determination of compensation of officers. Under the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) members of the Executive Board are elected by the Supervisory Board. The Executive Board manages the Company under its own responsibility, i.e., the Executive Board is not bound by orders of third parties. Neither the general meeting nor the Supervisory Board may issue orders to the Executive Board. The Executive Board is obligated to comply with the statutory regulations, the provisions of the Articles of Association and the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board relating to the competencies within the company, namely the competencies of the Supervisory Board and the general meeting. Furthermore the Supervisory Board is responsible for the compensation agreements with the members of Executive Board. When concluding these compensation agreements with the individual members of the Executive Board the Supervisory Board is obligated to ensure that the overall remuneration for the individual members of the Executive Board is reasonable in relation to their duties and the situation of the Company; Rule 4350(d) sets forth certain requirements with respect to a company's Audit Committee (including committee charter, composition, responsibilities and authority). The NASDAQ Rules require the creation of several specified board committees composed of independent directors and operating pursuant to written charters that set forth their tasks and responsibilities. AIXTRON currently has an Audit Committee. Nevertheless, German law precludes certain responsibilities from being delegated to a committee, such as the selection of the independent auditors, who are required by German law to be elected at the shareholders' meeting. The independence of the members of AIXTRON's Supervisory Board committees is governed by the independence standards applicable to Supervisory Board members. Collectively, AIXTRON's Supervisory Board is responsible for many of the same functions as the committees required under Rule 4350; Rule 4350(f) requires that a company's by-laws provide for a quorum for any meeting of the holders of common stock of at least 331/3% of the outstanding shares of the company's voting stock. Neither German law nor the rules and regulations promulgated by the Frankfurt Stock Exchange require a specific quorum for annual general meetings; therefore, AIXTRON's Articles of Association do not provide for a quorum. Such a requirement would be contrary to generally accepted business practice in Germany and the absence of a quorum requirement in AIXTRON's Articles of Association is consistent with German law; 44 Rule 4350(g) requires a company to solicit proxies and provide proxy statements for all meetings of shareholders and to provide copies of such proxy solicitation to NASDAQ. Under German law, the voting right may be exercised by a proxy. There are no restrictions regarding the person of the proxy. AIXTRON offers to its shareholders to exercise their voting rights in the general meeting through proxies appointed by the Company. The proxies appointed by AIXTRON are obliged to vote in accordance with the instructions of the represented shareholder. In such case, AIXTRON provides proxy statements which contain recommendations for the exercise of the voting right on each item of the agenda. In accordance with the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), AIXTRON keeps the declarations of such proxies available for inspection for a period of three years. Under the deposit agreement pertaining to AIXTRON's ADSs, JPMorgan Chase Bank as AIXTRON's depositary bank mails to holders of ADSs a notice stating inter alia that each holder of ADSs is entitled to instruct the depositary bank as to the exercise of the voting rights. Each shareholder who desires to exercise or to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights must execute and return a document provided by the depositary bank that instructs the depositary bank as to how the number of the shares represented by such holders' ADSs are to be voted; and Rule 4350(i) generally requires U.S. domestic companies to obtain shareholder approval of all equity-compensation plans (including stock option plans) and any material revisions to them. In lieu of the requirements of Rule 4350(i), AIXTRON follows the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), which requires that the adoption of stock option plans and any material revisions thereto be approved by the Company's shareholders insofar as the issuance of shares and/or stock options under authorized or contingent capital authorizations requires shareholder approval. This approval requires consideration of the key elements of the applicable option plan or relevant modifications. Other significant differences between AIXTRON's governance practices and those of U.S. domestic NASDAQ-listed companies are as follows: Two-Tier Board The German Stock Corporation Act requires AIXTRON to have a two-tier board structure consisting of an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board, which is not comparable to the one-tier or unitary board system in the U.S. The two-tier system provides a strict separation of management and supervision. Roles and responsibilities of each of the two boards are clearly defined by law. Independence Under this two-tier board system, except as described above, AIXTRON's methods for determining and ensuring the independence of its Supervisory Board differ from those of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4350, which generally contemplates a U.S.-style, one-tier system. In contrast to the NASDAQ Rules, which require the board to affirmatively determine the independence of the individual directors with reference to specific tests of independence, German law does not require the Supervisory Board to make such affirmative findings on an individual basis. At the same time, the Bylaws of AIXTRON's Supervisory Board contain several provisions to help ensure the independence of the Supervisory Board's advice and supervision. Furthermore, the members of AIXTRON's Supervisory and Executive Boards are strictly independent from one another. A member of one board is legally prohibited from being concurrently active on the other. Supervisory Board members have independent decision making authority and are legally prohibited from following the direction or instruction of any affiliated party. Moreover, Supervisory Board members may not enter into advisory, service or certain other contracts with AIXTRON, unless approved by the Supervisory Board. Compliance with the requirements of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4350 applicable to foreign private issuers Under Rule 4350(a)(1), as amended, however, even a foreign private issuer such as AIXTRON is still required to comply with Rule 4350(b)(1)(B)(relating to disclosure of "going concern" qualifications), Rule 4350(j)(relating to execution of NASDAQ form listing agreements) and Rule 4350(m)(relating to issuer notices to NASDAQ of material noncompliance with Rule 4350); and to have an Audit Committee that satisfies Rule 4350(d)(3)(regarding compliance with Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act) and to ensure that such Audit Committee's members meet the independence 45 requirement in 4350(d)(2)(A)(ii)(regarding independence required under Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act). AIXTRON's Supervisory Board has determined that as of December 31, 2007, the Company is in compliance with the aforementioned requirements applicable to foreign private issuers pursuant to Rule 4350. In particular, AIXTRON's Supervisory Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is "independent" as set forth in Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and as required by Rule 4350(d)(2)(A)(ii). Corporate Governance Guidelines AIXTRON has adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to the members of the Company's Executive Board and senior financial officers nominated by the Executive Board. Various documents pertaining to AIXTRON's corporate governance, including its Articles of Association and the report on the Company's fulfillment of the requirements of the German Corporate Governance Code, may be found on AIXTRON's internet website at www.aixtron.com. The information available on AIXTRON's website is not incorporated by reference into this report. C.

Dr. Schulte's present employment contract will expire on March 31, 2010. Intellectual Property Agreements Certain information, such as fees and royalties, in the manufacturing license and technical services agreement with Laboratoires D'Electronique Philips ("LEP") dated August 10, 1989 (the "LEP 46 Agreement") and in the exclusive patent and know-how license agreement with Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ("CNRS") and the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble ("INPG") executed December 17, 2002 (the "CNRS Agreement") is confidential and has been redacted from the copies of the LEP Agreement and the CNRS Agreement AIXTRON filed with the SEC. The LEP Agreement provides AIXTRON a license and technical information and support in regard to LEP's MOVPE reactor prototype (the "Planetary Reactor Prototype"). The worldwide license granted by LEP to AIXTRON is a non-transferable and exclusive license to use the technical information related to the Planetary Reactor Prototype to develop, manufacture, use, sell or otherwise market planetary reactors. AIXTRON shall not sublicense or transfer the technical information to third parties, except as to disclosures necessary for the manufacture, operations or maintenance of planetary reactors. The CNRS Agreement deals with the system for injection of precursors into a vacuum vapor deposition chamber (the "Product"). CNRS and INPG grant AIXTRON an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, use, sell the Product and exploit the patents and know-how in the entire world with the right to grant certain sub-licenses. Except for the specified sub-license grants, the CNRS Agreement is personal, not assignable and non-transferable. The CNRS Agreement remains in force during the life of the patents unless it is terminated by any of the parties to this agreement. D. Exchange Controls At present, Germany does not restrict the movement of capital between Germany and other countries or individuals except certain persons, entities and countries subject to embargoes in accordance with German law and applicable resolutions adopted by the United Nations and the European Union. For statistical purposes, with certain exceptions, every corporation or individual residing in Germany must report to the German Central Bank any payment received from or made to a non-resident corporation or individual if the payment exceeds € 12,500 (or the equivalent in a foreign currency). Additionally, corporations and individuals residing in Germany must report to the German Central Bank any claims of a resident against, or liabilities payable to, a non-resident corporation or individual exceeding an aggregate of € 5 million (or the equivalent in a foreign currency) at the end of any calendar month. Resident corporations and individuals are also required to report annually to the German Central Bank any stakes of 10% or more they hold in the equity of non-resident corporations with total assets of more than € 3 million. Corporations residing in Germany with assets in excess of € 3 million must report annually to the German Central Bank any stake of 10% or more in the company held by an individual or a corporation located outside Germany. E. Taxation German Taxation The following discussion is a summary of certain material German tax consequences for beneficial owners of AIXTRON's ordinary shares or ADSs: (1)who are not German residents for German income tax purposes (i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management and control is not located in Germany), and (2)whose shares or ADSs do not form part of the business property of a permanent establishment or fixed base in Germany. Throughout this section such owners are referred to as "Non-German Holders." The discussion is based on tax laws of Germany as in effect on the date of this annual report, including the Convention between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion With Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital and to Certain Other Taxes (the "Treaty"). Such laws are subject to change. The discussion is also based in part upon the representations of the Depositary and assumes that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. The following discussion does not purport to be a comprehensive discussion of all German tax consequences that may be relevant for Non-German Holders. AIXTRON's discussion does not address 47 all aspects of German taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the German federal, state and local tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of AIXTRON's shares or ADSs and the procedures to follow to obtain a refund of German taxes withheld from dividends. Taxation of the Company in Germany According to the Company Tax Reform 2008 Act (Unternehmensteuerreformgesetz 2008) the Corporation Tax rate charged in Germany as of 2008 is 15%. A 5.5% solidarity surcharge is imposed on the Corporation Tax, resulting in an overall tax rate of 15.825%. In addition, German corporations are by virtue of their legal form subject to a municipal profit-related German Trade Tax. Trade Tax is calculated on the basis of the taxable Corporation Tax income as shown in the annual statutory profit and loss accounts of the corporation which, however, is subject to certain particular Trade Tax add-backs and deductions. The effective Trade Tax rate applicable depends on the municipality in which the corporation maintains a permanent establishment and ranges between approximately 7% and 17%. With effect from 2008 Trade Tax cannot be deducted for Trade Tax and Corporate Tax purposes anymore. German Corporation Tax and Trade Tax combined will result in an overall tax burden for German corporations amounting to approximately 30% at an average instead of over 40% before 2008. However, some measures may lead to an increase to the taxable assessment basis. Under the Company Tax Reform 2008 Act, Germany introduced the Interest Ceiling Rules (Zinsschranke), disallowingwith narrow exceptionsan immediate deduction of interest expenses to the extent the interest expenses (net of interest income received (net interest surplus) in the same fiscal year) exceeds 30% of the corporation's taxable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Tax EBITDA). Disallowed interest payments can be carried forward. In addition, certain payments are classified as non deductible expenses for trade tax purpose. The deduction for a taxable loss carry forward for the fiscal year is unlimited up to a threshold of € 1,000,000, thereafter taxable income can only be offset to the extent of 60%. The temporary loss carry forward is reduced by the amount used and remains unlimited in life. However, there are limitations on the use of loss carry forwards upon a transfer of more than 25% of a corporation's shares or voting rights to one purchaser, a related party or group of purchasers within a specified time period. Withholding Tax on Dividends For dividend distributions made by AIXTRON, the Company is generally required to withhold tax of 20%. A solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on the withholding tax has been retained, resulting in a surcharge amount to 1.1% (5.5% × 20%), and a total effective withholding tax rate from dividends of 21.1%. For many Non-German Holders, the withholding tax rate is reduced under applicable income tax treaties. Under most income tax treaties to which Germany is a party, the rate of dividend withholding tax is reduced to 15%. To reduce the withholding to the applicable treaty rate of 15%, a Non-German Holder must apply for a refund of withholding taxes paid. Therefore you may apply for a refund of German withholding tax in an amount equal to 6.1% of the gross amount of the dividend you received (21.1% aggregate German withholding tax rate minus 15% Income Tax Treaty withholding tax rate). The application for refund must be filed with the German Federal Tax Office. The relevant forms can be obtained from the German Federal Tax Office or from German embassies and consulates. The German Company Tax Reform 2008 Act relating to withholding tax on dividends and capital gains becomes effective in 2009. From 2009 on the required withholding percentage will increase to 25%, plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge thereon, resulting in a surcharge amount to 1.375% and a total effective withholding tax rate for dividends and capital gains of 26.375%. Special Tax Rules for tax resident in Germany From January 1, 2009 onwards 100% of dividends of shares held as private assets will be subject to a 25% fixed tax rate plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge thereon. If church tax is individually applicable for the shareholder this part of taxation will be subject of the withholding as well. The half-income method will be abolished. This tax will be final unless the individual tax rate of the shareholder is less than 25% and the shareholder opts for the tax assessment. Moreover, form 2009 capital gains from the sales of shares, acquired after December 31, 2008, will be taxable as well. The lump sum deduction of 48 investment income related expenses amounts to € 801 for individuals and € 1,602 for married couples. Further investment income related expenses will not be tax deductible. Regarding shares held as business assets of the shareholder, 60% of the dividends will be subject to personal income tax (part income taxation). Accordingly, 60% of the income related expenses are deductible. Special Tax Rules for U.S. Shareholders Under the Treaty, the withholding tax rate generally is reduced to 15% of the gross amount of the dividends. Dividend payments to an eligible U.S. holder made by AIXTRON will be subject to a 15% general withholding tax rate under the Treaty. Dividend distributions made by the Company are subject to a 20% withholding tax (25% as of January 1, 2009) plus a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on the withholding tax resulting in an aggregate German withholding tax of 21.1% (26.375% as of January 1, 2009) of the declared dividend, and eligible U.S. holders (as defined below under "U.S. Taxation") are entitled to receive a payment from the German tax authorities equal to 6.1% of the declared dividend. Accordingly, for a declared dividend of 100, an eligible U.S. holder initially will receive 78.9 (100 minus the 21.1% withholding tax) (as of January 1, 200): 73.625: 100 minus the 26.375% withholding tax). The eligible U.S. holder is then entitled to a refund from the German tax authorities of 6.1 and will, as a result, effectively receive a total of 85 (i.e., 85% of the declared dividend). In addition to this the taxation of capital gains resulting from sales from disposal of shares invested after January 1, 2009 are subject to the withholding tax rate of 26.375% as well. Withholding Refund Procedure for U.S. Shareholders For shares and ADSs kept in custody with The Depository Trust Company in New York or one of its participating banks, the German tax authorities have introduced a collective procedure for the refund of German dividend, capital withholding tax and the solidarity surcharge thereon on a trial basis. Under this procedure, The Depository Trust Company may submit claims for refunds payable to eligible U.S. holders under the Treaty collectively to the German tax authorities on behalf of these eligible U.S. holders. The German Federal Tax Office will pay the refund amounts on a preliminary basis to The Depository Trust Company, which will redistribute these amounts to the eligible U.S. holders according to the regulations governing the procedure. The German Federal Tax Office may review whether the refund was made in accordance with the law within four years after making the payment to The Depository Trust Company. Details of this collective procedure are available from The Depository Trust Company. Individual claims for refunds may be made on a special German form which must be filed with the German Federal Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern, Dienstsitz Bonn, An der Küppe 1, 53225 Bonn, Germany). Copies of this form can be downloaded from the following website: http://www.bzst.bund.de/003_menue_links/008_kapertragsteuer/084_ausl_antragsteller/843_vordruck /004_E_USA.pdf or can be obtained from the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, 4645 Reservoir Road, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20007-1998. Claims must be filed within a four-year period from the end of the calendar year in which the dividend was received. As part of the individual refund claim, an eligible U.S. holder must submit to the German tax authorities the original bank voucher (or a certified copy thereof) issued by the paying agent documenting the tax withheld, and an official certification on IRS Form 6166 of its last United States federal income tax return. IRS Form 6166 may be obtained by filing a request with the Internal Revenue Service Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Foreign Certification Request, P.O. Box 16347, Philadelphia, PA 19114-0447. Requests for certification must include the eligible U.S. holder's name, Social Security or Employer Identification Number, tax return form number, and tax period for which the certification is requested. Requests for certifications can include a request to the Internal Revenue Service to send the certification directly to the German tax authorities. If no such request is made, the Internal Revenue Service will send a certification on IRS Form 6166 to the eligible U.S. holder, who then must submit this document with his refund claim. 49 Taxation of Capital Gains for U.S. Shareholders The Income Tax Treaty provides that the German capital gains tax does not apply to gains on the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Ordinary shares. Inheritance and Gift Tax The Estate Tax Treaty provides that an individual whose domicile is determined to be in the United States for purposes of such Treaty will not be subject to German inheritance and gift tax (the equivalent of the United States federal estate and gift tax) on the individual's death or making of a gift unless the ADSs or Ordinary Shares (1) are part of the business property of a permanent establishment located in Germany or (2) are part of the assets of a fixed base of an individual located in Germany and used for the performance of independent personal services. An individual's domicile in the United States, however does not prevent imposition of German inheritance and gift tax with respect to an heir, donee, or other beneficiary who either is or is deemed to be resident in Germany at the time the individual died or the gift was made. The Estate Tax Treaty also provides a credit against U.S. federal estate and gift tax liability for the amount of inheritance and gift tax paid to Germany, subject to certain limitations, in a case where the ADSs or Ordinary Shares are subject to German inheritance or gift tax and U.S. federal estate or gift tax. Other Taxes No German transfer, stamp or similar taxes apply to the purchase, sale or other disposition of shares or ADSs by Non-German Holder. Currently, net worth tax is not levied in Germany. U.S. Federal Taxation The following is a summary of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant with respect to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of AIXTRON's shares or ADSs. This summary addresses only the U.S. federal income tax considerations of holders that hold shares or ADSs as capital assets. This summary does not address tax considerations applicable to holders that may be subject to special tax rules, such as: financial institutions; insurance companies; real estate investment trusts; regulated investment companies; grantor trusts; dealers or traders in securities or currencies; tax-exempt entities; persons that received shares or ADSs as compensation for the performance of services; persons that will hold shares or ADSs as part of a "hedging" or "conversion" transaction or as a position in a "straddle" for U.S. federal income tax purposes; certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; persons that have a "functional currency" other than the U.S. dollar; or holders that own (or are deemed to own) 10% or more (by voting power or value) of AIXTRON's shares or ADSs. Moreover, this summary does not address the U.S. federal estate and gift or alternative minimum tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of AIXTRON's shares or ADSs. This summary is based on (1) the federal tax laws of the United States as in effect and available on the date of this annual report, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, and currently effective and proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, each as available on the date hereof, and (2) in part on the representations and covenants of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related 50 agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. All of the foregoing is subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below. For purposes of this summary, a "U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner of AIXTRON's shares or ADSs that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is: (1) a citizen or resident of the U.S., (2) a partnership or corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (3) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (4) a trust if such trust validly elects to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if (a) a court within the U.S. is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and (b) one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of the trust. A "Non-U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner of AIXTRON's shares or ADSs that is not a U.S. Holder. If a partnership (or any other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds AIXTRON's shares or ADSs, the tax treatment of such partnership and a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such a partnership or partner should consult its own tax advisor as to its consequences. Each prospective purchaser should consult his/her own tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning or disposing of AIXTRON's shares or ADSs. Ownership of ADSs in general For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a holder of ADSs generally will be treated as the owner of the shares represented by such ADSs. The U.S. Treasury Department has expressed concern that depositaries for ADSs, or other intermediaries between the holders of shares of an issuer and the issuer, may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of U.S. foreign tax credits by U.S. Holders of such receipts or shares. Accordingly, the analysis regarding the availability of a U.S. foreign tax credit for German taxes and sourcing rules described below could be affected by future actions that may be taken by the U.S. Treasury Department. Distributions Subject to the discussion below under "Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations," the gross amount of any distribution the Company makes of cash or property (other than certain distributions, if any, of shares distributed pro rata to all AIXTRON shareholders, including holders of ADSs) with respect to shares or ADSs, before reduction for any German taxes withheld there from, will be includible in income by a U.S. Holder as dividend income to the extent such distributions are paid out of the Company's current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Subject to the discussion below under "Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations," individuals who are U.S. Holders may be taxed on any such dividends received in a taxable year beginning on or before December 31, 2010 at the lower tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains (i.e., gains from the sale of capital assets held for more than one year). In order to qualify for the preferential rate of taxation, certain requirements must be met, including certain holding period requirements and the absence of certain risk reduction transactions with respect to the shares or ADSs. Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to corporate U.S. Holders. Subject to the discussion below under "Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations," to the extent, if any, that the amount of any distribution AIXTRON makes exceeds its current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, it will be treated first as a tax-free return of the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. AIXTRON does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles. Any such dividend paid in Euros will be included in the gross income of a U.S. Holder in an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the Euros on the date of receipt, which in the case of ADSs, is the date they are received by the depositary. The amount of any distribution of property other than cash will be the fair market value of such property on the date of distribution. A U.S. Holder may elect to deduct in computing his/her taxable income or, subject to certain complex limitations on foreign tax credits generally, credit against its U.S. federal income tax liability German withholding tax at the rate applicable to such U.S. Holder. As discussed under "German TaxationSpecial Tax Rules for U.S. Shareholders" above in this Item 10 under the Treaty, dividends paid by AIXTRON to a U.S. Holder 51 generally will be subject to a German withholding tax rate of 15%. Such reduced rate of withholding will apply only if such U.S. Holder is treated as a resident of the U.S. for purposes of such Treaty and otherwise is entitled to the benefits of such treaty and the dividends are not effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base of such U.S. Holder that is situated in Germany. Dividends received by a U.S. Holder with respect to ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as foreign source income, which may be relevant in calculating such holder's foreign tax credit limitation. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. For purposes of calculating the U.S. foreign tax credit, dividends paid by AIXTRON generally will constitute "passive category income," or in the case of certain U.S. Holders, "general category income." U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of, and limitations on, any such foreign tax credit. Subject to the discussion under "Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting Requirements" below in this section, a Non-U.S. Holder of shares or ADSs generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on dividends received on shares or ADSs, unless such income is effectively connected with the conduct by such Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States. Sale or exchange of shares or ADSs Subject to the discussion below under "Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations," a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale or exchange of shares or ADSs equal to the difference between the amount realized on such sale or exchange and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares or ADSs. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. In the case of a non-corporate U.S. Holder, the maximum marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to such gain will be lower than the maximum marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income (other than certain dividends) if such U.S. Holder's holding period for such shares or ADSs exceeds one year. Gain or loss, if any, recognized by a U.S. Holder generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder's initial tax basis in shares or ADSs will be the U.S. dollar value of the Euro denominated purchase price determined on the date of purchase. If the shares or ADSs are treated as traded on an "established securities market," a cash basis U.S. Holder, or, if it elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the dollar value of the cost of such shares or ADSs by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. If a U.S. Holder converts U.S. dollars to Euros and immediately uses that currency to purchase shares or ADSs, such conversion generally will not result in taxable gain or loss to such U.S. Holder. With respect to the sale or exchange of shares or ADSs, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the payment received determined on (1) the date of receipt of payment in the case of a cash basis U.S. Holder and (2) the date of disposition in the case of an accrual basis U.S. Holder. If the shares or ADSs are treated as traded on an "established securities market," a cash basis taxpayer, or, if he/she elects, an accrual basis taxpayer, will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized by translating the amount received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the sale. Subject to the discussion under "Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting Requirements" below in this section, a Non-U.S. Holder of shares or ADSs generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any gain realized on the sale or exchange of such shares or ADSs unless (1) such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by such Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the U.S. or (2) in the case of any gain realized by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, such holder is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of such sale or exchange and certain other conditions are met. Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations A Non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a "passive foreign investment company," or a PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year in which, after applying certain look-through rules, either: (i) at least 75% of its gross income is "passive income;" or (ii) at least 50% of the average value of its gross assets is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. Passive income for this purpose generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents and gains from commodities and securities transactions. 52 Based on certain estimates of the Company's gross income and gross assets and the nature of the Company's business, AIXTRON does not believe it was a PFIC for the taxable year ending December 31, 2007. AIXTRON's status in future years will depend on its assets and activities in those years. AIXTRON has no reason to believe that its assets or activities will change in a manner that would cause the Company to be classified as a PFIC, but there can be no assurance that AIXTRON will not be considered a PFIC for any taxable year. If AIXTRON were a PFIC, U.S. Holders generally would be subject to imputed interest charges and other disadvantageous tax treatment with respect to any gain from the sale or exchange of, and certain distributions with respect to, shares or ADSs. If AIXTRON were a PFIC, U.S. Holders could make a variety of elections that may alleviate certain tax consequences referred to above, and one of these elections may be made retroactively. However, it is expected that the conditions necessary for making certain of such elections will not apply in the case of AIXTRON's shares and the ADSs. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences that would arise if AIXTRON were to be treated as a PFIC. Backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements U.S. backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements generally apply to certain payments to certain non-corporate holders of stock. Information reporting generally will apply to payments of dividends on, and to proceeds from the sale or redemption of, shares or ADSs made within the United States, or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman to a holder of shares or ADSs, other than an "exempt recipient," including a corporation, a payee that is not a U.S. person that provides an appropriate certification, and certain other persons. A payor will be required to withhold backup withholding tax from any payments of dividends on, or the proceeds from the, sale or redemption of, shares or ADSs within the United States to a holder, or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, other than an "exempt recipient," if such holder fails to furnish its correct taxpayer identification number or otherwise fails to comply with, or establish an exemption from, such backup withholding tax requirements. The backup withholding rate is 28% for taxable years through 2010. In the case of such payments made within the U.S. to a foreign simple trust, a foreign grantor trust or a foreign partnership, other than payments to a foreign simple trust, a foreign grantor trust or a foreign partnership that qualifies as a "withholding foreign trust" or a "withholding foreign partnership" within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations and payments to a foreign simple trust, a foreign grantor trust or a foreign partnership that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S., the beneficiaries of the foreign simple trust, the persons treated as the owners of the foreign grantor trust or the partners of the foreign partnership, as the case may be, will be required to provide the certification discussed above in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements. Moreover, a payor may rely on a certification provided by a payee that is not a U.S. person only if such payor does not have actual knowledge or a reason to know that any information or certification stated in such certificate is incorrect. The above summary is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences that may be relevant to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of shares or ADSs, and does not address state, local, foreign or other tax laws. Holders of shares or ADSs should consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of their particular situations. F. Dividends and Paying Agents Not applicable. G.

In accordance with these requirements, AIXTRON files reports and other information with the SEC. These materials, including this report and the exhibits thereto, may be inspected and copied at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the materials may be obtained from the SEC's Public Reference Room at prescribed rates. The public may obtain 53 information on the operation of the SEC's Public Reference Room by calling the SEC in the United States at 1-800-SEC-0330. AIXTRON's filings, including this report, are also available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. I. Subsidiary Information Not applicable. Item 11: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk The global nature of AIXTRON's businesses exposes the Company to market risks resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rates. Accordingly, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates may adversely affect its operating results and financial condition. AIXTRON is also exposed to commodity price risks. AIXTRON seeks to manage and control these market risks primarily through monitoring of its operating and financial activities and the use of derivative financial instruments. Exchange Rate Risk Transaction Risk and Currency Risk Management The global nature of AIXTRON's businesses exposes its operations and reported financial results and cash flows to the risks arising from fluctuations in the exchange rates of the dollar, the Euro and other world currencies. AIXTRON's businesses are exposed to transaction risk whenever the Company has revenues in a currency that is different from the currency in which it incurs the costs of generating those revenues. When AIXTRON converts the revenues into the currency in which it incurs the costs, the value of the revenues may have declined in the interim relative to the currency in which the Company incurred the costs. These risks primarily affect the Company's business in Europe, which generates a part of AIXTRON's system revenues in foreign currencies, primarily U.S. dollars, and incurs manufacturing costs primarily in Euros. Effects of Currency Translation Most of AIXTRON's subsidiaries are located outside the Euro zone. Since the Company's financial reporting currency is the Euro, AIXTRON translates the income statements of these subsidiaries into Euros so that the Company can include their financial results in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Period-to-period changes in the average exchange rate for a particular country's currency can significantly affect the translation of both revenues and operating income denominated in that currency into Euros. AIXTRON has assets and liabilities outside the Euro zone. These assets and liabilities are denominated in local currencies and reside primarily at AIXTRON's subsidiaries in the United States and the United Kingdom. When AIXTRON converts net asset values into Euros, currency fluctuations result in period-to-period changes in those net asset values. The Company's equity position reflects these changes in net asset values. AIXTRON generally does not hedge against this type of risk. Foreign Currency Risk The Company's activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including forward exchange contracts and options to hedge the exchange rate risk arising from the exporting of equipment. The main exchange rates giving rise to the risk are those between the U.S. dollar, pound sterling, and Euro. The Company's use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Company's policies, approved by the Supervisory Board, which provide principles on foreign exchange rate risk and the use of derivative financial instruments. Exposures are reviewed on a regular basis. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for purely speculative purposes. Exposure to exchange rate risk is managed by the company through sensitivity analysis. The following table details the Company's historical sensitivity to a 10% increase in the value of the Euro against the principal foreign currencies involved. 54 This represents AIXTRON's assessment of the possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis of the Company's exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and sustained throughout the entire year. A negative number indicates a decrease in revenue and net income or net loss where the Euro strengthens against the US-Dollar or the Pound Sterling. US$ Impact 2007 2006 2005 (€ thousands) Revenues (15.740 ) (11.319 ) (8.359 ) Net Result (5.034 ) (3.651 ) (206 ) GBP Impact 2007 2006 2005 (€ thousands) Revenues (415 ) (291 ) (591 ) Net Result 2.391 499 123 The sensitivity of the Company's net income to exchange rate risk is reduced, in comparison with the effect on revenue, by the use of foreign currency exchange contracts and by the "natural hedge" effect of costs incurred in those currencies. The sensitivity analysis for the impact of a strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar in 2005 includes the effect on the results of a theoretical increase in impairment of goodwill amounting to € 2.6 million in 2005. It is the Company's policy to enter into foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency receipts within the range of 80 to 90% of the expected exposure. The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated sales transactions, generally in the range of 15 months and generally within 50 to 60% of the exposure generated. Interest Rate Risk The Company is subject only to minor effects from interest rate fluctuations relating to interest rate influenced cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, bank loans and convertible bonds. See Note 29 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements ("Financial Instruments") for more information on the credit, interest rate, and currency risks arising in AIXTRON's normal course of business.

Item 14: Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds Not applicable. Item 15: Controls and Procedures Attached as exhibits to this Form 20-F are certifications of AIXTRON's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. This "Controls and Procedures" section includes information concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in the certifications. Page 61 sets forth the report of Deloitte & Touche GmbH, AIXTRON's independent registered public accounting firm regarding its audit of AIXTRON's internal control over financial reporting. Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, Management of AIXTRON conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of AIXTRON's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of AIXTRON's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, AIXTRON's Chief Executive Officer Paul Hyland and Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Breme have concluded that, as of December 31, 2007, AIXTRON's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by AIXTRON in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act and are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by AIXTRON in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to AIXTRON's Management, including AIXTRON's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting AIXTRON's Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, for AIXTRON. Under the supervision and with the participation of AIXTRON's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, AIXTRON's Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of AIXTRON's internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in "Internal ControlIntegrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Management has concluded that AIXTRON's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Accounting Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB. Deloitte & Touche GmbH, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 20-F and, as part of the audit, has issued a report, included herein, on the effectiveness of AIXTRON's internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the year ended December 31, 2007 there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 56 Inherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures in Internal Control over Financial Reporting It should be noted that any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Item 16A: Audit Committee Financial Experts As of December 31, 2007, AIXTRON's Supervisory Board has determined that Prof. Dr. Blättchen is an "Audit Committee financial expert." The Supervisory Board has determined that the "Audit Committee financial expert" is "independent" as set forth in Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. Item 16B: Code of Ethics AIXTRON has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the members of the Company's Executive Board and senior financial officers nominated by AIXTRON's Executive Board. All of these Executive Board members and senior financial officers have agreed to abide by this code of ethics. AIXTRON's code of ethics, which is filed as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 20-F, is consistent with the requirements of the German Code of Corporate Governance and the NASDAQ Stock Market. The Company has revised its code of ethics in 2007 and has published the updated version of the code of ethics on its website at www.aixtron.com. A copy of the code of ethics may be obtained free of charge by written request to AIXTRON AG, Kackertstr. 15-17, 52072 Aachen, Germany or from the contact form on AIXTRONs website. Item 16C: Principal Accountant Fees and Services Fees related to audit services and other services rendered by AIXTRON's independent principal accountant, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu ("Deloitte & Touche"), for the years 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Type of Fees (Dec. 31) 2007 (Dec. 31) 2006 (€ millions) Audit Fees 0.73 1.37 Audit-Related Fees 0.03 0.04 Tax Fees 0.09 0.05 All Other Fees 0.02 0.01 Total 0.87 1.47 In the above table, "audit fees" are the aggregate Deloitte & Touche fees for professional services in connection with the audit of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, reviews of interim financial statements, as well as audits of statutory financial statements of AIXTRON and its subsidiaries. Also included in "audit fees" are amounts for attestation services in relation to regulatory filings and other compliance requirements. "Audit-related fees" are fees for accounting advice on actual or contemplated transactions, due diligence engagements related to acquisitions, attestation regarding compliance with certain agreements and other agreed-upon procedures. "Tax fees" are fees for tax advice on actual or contemplated transactions, tax compliance and expatriate employee tax services. "All Other Fees" are miscellaneous items. Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies In accordance with German law, AIXTRON'S independent auditors are appointed at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting based on a recommendation of the Company's Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board prepares the Board's recommendation on the selection of the independent auditors. Subsequent to the auditors' appointment, the Supervisory Board awards the contract and in its sole authority approves the terms and scope of the audit and all audit engagement fees, as well as monitors the auditors' independence. On May 22, 2007, at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, Deloitte & Touche GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Düsseldorf, Germany was appointed to serve as the Company's independent auditors for the year ending December 31, 2007. 57 In order to assure the integrity of independent audits, AIXTRON's Audit Committee established a policy to approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Company's independent auditors prior to the auditors' engagement. As part of this approval process, the Audit Committee adopted pre-approval policies and procedures pursuant to which the Audit Committee annually pre-approves certain types of services to be performed by AIXTRON's independent auditors. Under the policies, the Company's independent auditors are not allowed to perform any non-audit services which may impair the auditors' independence under the rules of the SEC. In fiscal year 2007 the Supervisory Board pre-approved 100% of the performance by Deloitte & Touche GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Düsseldorf, Germany of the above specified audit and permitted non-audit services.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AIXTRON Aktiengesellschaft and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March, 12 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

F-6 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. General principles AIXTRON AG ("AIXTRON AG") is incorporated as a stock corporation ("Aktiengesellschaft") under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Company is domiciled at Kackertstraße 15-17, 52072 Aachen, Germany. AIXTRON AG is registered in the commercial register of the District Court ("Amtsgericht") of Aachen under HRB 7002. The consolidated financial statements of AIXTRON AG and its subsidiaries ("AIXTRON"or "Company") have been prepared in accordance with, and fully comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and the interpretations as published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); and also International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the European Union; and also the requirements of Section 315a of HGB (German Commercial Law). AIXTRON is a leading provider of deposition equipment to the semiconductor and compound-semiconductor industry. The Company's technology solutions are used by a diverse range of customers worldwide to build advanced components for electronic and opto-electronic applications based on compound, silicon, or organic semiconductor materials. Such components are used in fibre optic communication systems, wireless and mobile telephony applications, optical and electronic storage devices, computing, signalling and lighting, displays, as well as a range of other leading-edge technologies. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Executive Board and have been submitted to the Supervisory Board for its meeting held on March 12, 2008. 2. Significant accounting policies (a) Companies included in consolidation Companies included in consolidation are the parent company, AIXTRON AG, and 8 companies, in which AIXTRON AG has a 100% direct shareholding or control. The balance sheet date of all consolidated companies is December 31. A list of all significant consolidated companies is shown in note 34. (b) Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro (EUR). The amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand Euro (kEUR). Some items in the balance sheet and income statement have been combined under one heading to improve the clarity of presentation. Such items are disclosed and commented on individually in the notes. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if this revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Judgments which have a significant effect on the Company's financial statements are described in Note 41. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies have been applied consistently by each consolidated company. F-7 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2. Significant accounting policies (Continued) (c) Bases of consolidation (i) Subsidiaries Entities over which AIXTRON AG has control are treated as subsidiaries (see note 34). Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that controlling influence commences. (ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation All intercompany income and expenses, transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation. (d) Foreign currency The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in Euro (EUR). In the translation of financial statements of subsidiaries outside the Euro-Zone the local currencies are used as functional currencies of these subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated to EUR at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated to EUR at average exchange rates for the year or at average exchange rates for the period between their inclusion in the consolidated financial statements and the balance sheet date. Net equity is translated at historical rates. The differences arising on translation are disclosed in income and expenses recognised in equity. Exchange gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates in the case of foreign currency transactions are recognised in the income statement in "other operating income" or "other operating expenses". (e) Property, plant and equipment (i) Acquisition or manufacturing cost Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, plus ancillary charges, less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy (k)). Costs of internally generated assets include not only costs of material and personnel, but also a share of overhead costs. Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. Interest is expensed as incurred. (ii) Subsequent costs The Company recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing components or enhancement of such an item when that cost is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied in the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other costs such as repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. (iii) Government grants Government grants related to the acquisition or manufacture of owned assets are deducted from original cost at date of capitalisation. F-8 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2. Significant accounting policies (Continued) (iv) Depreciation Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:  Buildings 25 years  Machinery and equipment 3-10 years  Other plant, factory and office equipment 3-8 years (f) Intangible assets (i) Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since January 1, 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill, determined under the previous accounting principles (US-GAAP), applied until 2004, and has continued to be recognised at its then carrying amount. Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment loss. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment (see accounting policy (k)). (ii) Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding using scientific methods, is recognised as an expense as incurred. Expenditure on development comprises costs incurred with the purpose of using scientific knowledge technically and commercially. As not all criteria of IAS 38 are met or are only met at a very late point within the development process, for reasons of materiality AIXTRON did not capitalise such costs. (iii) Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Company are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy (k)). Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are stated at their fair value at the date of purchase (see note 4). Expenditure on internally generated goodwill, trademarks and patents is expensed as incurred. (iv) Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred. (v) Amortisation Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, except for goodwill. Goodwill is tested annually in respect of its recoverable amount. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:  Software 2-3 years  Patents and similar rights 5-18 years  Customer base and product and technology know how 6-7 years F-9 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2. Significant accounting policies (Continued) (g) Investment property Investment properties are measured using the cost model. (h) Financial Instruments (i) Financial Assets Financial assets are classified into the following specific categories: financial assets 'at fair value through the profit or loss' (FVTPL), 'held to maturity investments', and 'loans and receivables'. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Investments are recognised at the contract date, and are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value. (ii) Financial assets at FVTPL Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL where the asset is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the estimated amount that a bank would receive or pay to terminate the derivative contracts at the reporting date, taking into account current exchange rates, volatility and the credit-worthiness of the counterparties (mark-to-market). (iii) Held to maturity investments Investments with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Company intends to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity investments. Held to maturity investments are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less any impairment, with revenue recognised on an effective yield basis. (iv) Trade receivables Trade receivables and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. (v) Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted. The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying F-10 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2. Significant accounting policies (Continued) amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised. (vi) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits with banks with a maturity of up to three months at inception. (vii) Equity instruments Equity instruments, including share capital, issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. (viii) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities "at FVTPL" or "other financial liabilities". (ix) Financial liabilities at FVTPL Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the estimated amount that a bank would receive or pay to terminate the derivative contracts at the reporting date, taking into account current exchange rates, volatility and the credit-worthiness of the counterparties (mark-to-market). (x) Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. (xi) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Company's activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange currency rates (see note 30). The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The use of financial derivatives is governed by policies approved by the Executive Board, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as effective hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the derivative financial instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period. F-11 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2. Significant accounting policies (Continued) (i) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. Cost is determined using weighted average cost. The cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes direct material and production cost, as well as an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Allowance for slow moving, excess and obsolete, and otherwise unsaleable inventory is recorded based primarily on either the Company's estimated forecast of product demand and production requirement for the next twelve months or historical trailing twelve month usage. When there has been no usage of an inventory item during a period of twelve months, the Company writes down such inventories based on previous experience. (j) Operating Result Operating result is stated before finance income, finance expense and tax. (k) Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets Goodwill purchased as part of a business acquisition is tested annually for impairment, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment. For impairment test purposes, the goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units. Impairment losses are recognised to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the higher of net realisable value or value in use (recoverable amount) of the cash-generating unit. Property, plant and equipment as well as other intangible assets are tested for impairment, where there is any indication that the asset may be impaired. Impairment losses on such assets are recognised, to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds either the net realisable value that would be obtainable from a sale in an arm's length transaction, or the value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments and the risks associated with the asset. Impairment losses are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Reversals are made only to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. (l) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of issued common shares and AIXTRON ADS (see note 23) for the year. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if options issued under the Company's stock option plans were exercised and convertible bonds were converted, unless such conversion had an anti-dilutive effect. (m) Convertible bonds Convertible bonds that can be converted to share capital at the option of the holder, where the number of shares issued does not vary with changes in their fair value, are accounted for as compound financial instruments. Transaction costs that relate to the issue of a compound financial instrument are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds. The equity component of the convertible bonds is calculated as the excess of the issue proceeds over the present F-12 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2. Significant accounting policies (Continued) value of the future interest and principal payments, discounted at the market rate of interest applicable to similar liabilities that do not have a conversion option. The interest expense recognised in the income statement is calculated using the effective interest rate method. (n) Employee benefits (i) Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. (ii) Defined benefit plans The obligation from defined benefit plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the income statement at each balance sheet date. (iii) Share-based payment transactions The stock option programs allows members of the Executive Board, management and employees of the Company to acquire shares/ADS (see note 25) of the Company. These stock option programs are accounted for by AIXTRON according to IFRS 2. The fair value of options granted after November 7, 2002 is recognised as personnel expense with a corresponding increase in the additional paid-in capital. The fair value is calculated at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial lattice model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. In the calculation of the personnel expense options forfeited are taken into account. (o) Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle this obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks associated with the liability. (i) Warranties The Company offers one to two year warranties on all of its products. Warranty expenses generally include cost of labor, material and related overhead necessary to repair a product free of charge during the warranty period. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties may vary depending on the equipment sold, the terms of the contract and the locations from which they are sold. The Company establishes the costs that may be incurred under its warranty obligations and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognised. Factors that affect the Company's warranty liability include the historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. The Company accrues material and labor cost for systems shipped based upon historical experience. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty provisions and adjusts the amounts as necessary. F-13 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2. Significant accounting policies (Continued) (ii) Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. (p) Revenue Revenue is generated from the sale and installation of equipment, spare parts and maintenance services. The sale of equipment involves a customer acceptance test at AIXTRON's production facility. After successful completion of this test, the equipment is dismantled and packaged for shipment. Upon arrival at the customer site the equipment is reassembled and installed, which is a service generally performed by AIXTRON engineers. AIXTRON gives no general rights of return, discounts, credits or other sales incentives within its terms of sale. However, occasionally some customers of AIXTRON have specifically negotiated terms and conditions of business. Revenues from the sale of products that have been demonstrated to meet product specification requirements are recognised upon shipment to the customer, if a full customer acceptance test has been successfully completed at the AIXTRON production facility and the risk has passed to the customer. Revenue relating to the installation of the equipment at the customer's site is recognised when the installation is completed and the final customer acceptance has been confirmed. The portion of the contract revenue deferred until completion of the installation services is determined based on either the fair value of the installation services or the portion of the contract amount that is due and payable upon completion of the installation. Fair value of the installation services is determined based on an estimate of the materials and time required to complete the installation. Revenue related to products where meeting the product specification requirements has not yet been demonstrated, or where specific rights of return have been negotiated, is recognised only upon final customer acceptance. Revenue on the sale of spare parts is recognised when title and risk passes to the customer, generally upon shipment. Revenue from maintenance services is recognised as the services are provided. (q) Expenses (i) Cost of sales Cost of sales includes such direct costs as materials, labor and related production overheads. (ii) Research and development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Project funding received from governments (e.g. state funding) and the European Union is recorded in other operating income, if the Research and Development costs are incurred and provided that the conditions for the funding have been met. (iii) Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. F-14 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2. Significant accounting policies (Continued) (r) Other operating income Government grants Government grants awarded for project funding are recorded in "Other operating income" if the Research and Development costs are incurred and provided that the conditions for the funding have been met. (s) Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for all temporary differences between tax and commercial balance sheets and for losses brought forward for tax purposes as well as for tax credits of the companies included in consolidation. The deferred taxes are calculated, based on tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date or known to be applicable in the future. Effects of changes in tax rates on the deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised upon adoption of the amended law. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits can be set off against tax credits and tax loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit can be realised. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is reviewed at least annually. (t) Segment reporting A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Company that is engaged in providing products or services which are subject to similar risks and rewards. AIXTRON operates in worldwide markets. As the risks and rates of return are primarily affected by projects and services, the primary format for the reporting of segment information is business segments with secondary information reported geographically. Internally reported product lines are combined for group reporting in one business segment as defined in IAS 14.34, as they show only insignificant differences as to long term profit forecasts and as they are materially similar in the assessment of the criteria used to distinguish the individual business segments as defined in IAS 14.9. Accounting standards applied in segment reporting are in accordance with the general accounting policies as explained in this section. The disclosed revenues earned with other segments are at arm's length. (u) Cash flow statement The cash flow statement is prepared in accordance with IAS 7. Cash flows from operating activities are prepared using the indirect method. Cash inflows and cash outflows from taxes and interest are included in cash flows from operating activities. (v) Recently issued accounting standards In the current year, the company has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2007, and the related amendment to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements. The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the amendment to IFRS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these statements concerning the company's financial instruments and management of capital. Four interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee are effective for the current period. These are: IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies; IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2; IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives; and IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment. The adoption of these interpretations has not led to any changes in the Company's accounting policies. F-15 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2. Significant accounting policies (Continued) The following list shows IFRS Standards and Amendments to IFRS not compulsory and not applicable for reporting periods ended on December 31, 2007. These standards were not applied earlier than required. AIXTRON is currently analysing the impact of the new standards on its consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. IFRS 8 Operating Segments Issued: November 2006 IFRIC 11 IFRS 2Group and Treasury Share Transactions Issued: November 2006 IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements Issued: November 2006 IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes Issued: October 2007 IFRIC 14 IAS 19The Limit of a Defined Benefit Asset. Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction Issued: October 2007 Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs Issued: March 2007 3. Segment reporting The following segment information has been prepared in accordance with IAS 14 "Segment Reporting". As AIXTRON has only one reportable business segment (see note 2(t)), the segment information provided relates only to the Company's geographical segments, this being secondary segment information. The Company markets and sells the majority of its products in Asia, Europe and the United States, mainly through its direct sales organisation and cooperation partners. In presenting information on the basis of geographical segments, segment revenue is based on the geographical location of customers.

The resulting entity was renamed AIXTRON, Inc., Sunnyvale (see note 34). All disclosures relating to the acquisition of the former Genus, Inc. are described as referring to "former Genus" or "Genus". On July 2, 2004, AIXTRON announced its intention to acquire Genus, Inc. Genus is a supplier of Atomic Layer Deposition and Chemical Vapor Deposition technology, which is required in the production of advanced semiconductors and hard disk drives. AIXTRON acquired all issued and outstanding shares of Genus, Inc. with effect from March 14, 2005. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declared the F-4 registration statement of AIXTRON AG effective on February 8, 2005. On March 10, 2005, the extraordinary meeting of shareholders of Genus, Inc. took place. The shareholders of Genus approved the merger pursuant to the laws of the State of California through the affirmative vote of holders of more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares. As part of the acquisition of Genus by AIXTRON all Genus, Inc. shares were exchanged for AITRON American Depositary Shares (ADS) in a stock-for-stock transaction. The shareholders of Genus received 0.51 AIXTRON ADS in exchange for each Genus common share. Each AIXTRON ADS represents the beneficial ownership in one AIXTRON common share. In the context of the acquisition, AIXTRON issued additional ADS for the holders of employee stock options, other options and convertible bonds existing at the date of acquisition. These ADS were transferred to a trust at the date of acquisition that keeps the ADS until they are granted to the holders of the options and the convertible bonds. Upon consummation of the transaction, the historical shareholders of AIXTRON AG held approximately 72% and the former shareholders of Genus approximately 28% of AIXTRON AG taking into consideration all ADS issued as part of the transaction (see note 22). The total purchase price for the acquisition of Genus comprises the following: (in EUR thousands) Fair value of an AIXTRON share of common stock as of March 14, 2005 (20,539,956 shares at 3.72 € per share) 76,409 Fair value of the stock options granted by Genus, Inc. 2,494 Fair value of the convertible bond issued by Genus, Inc. 3,799 Acquisition-related costs 9,403 92,105 The fair value of shares granted by AIXTRON AG was calculated as the quoted share price at the transfer date.

F-23 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 12. Property, plant and equipment (Continued) Impairments During 2007 an impairment loss for self-built systems of kEUR 332 (2006 kEUR 816) was recognised. Changes in the required technical specifications and a lack of usability resulted in a write-off of capitalized equipment. Impairments in 2005 amounted to kEUR 1,601 and were attributable to the complete write-down of certain assets. Such assets were constructed for the further development of AIXTRON technology in the semiconductor industry (especially silicon germanium applications for Telecom/Datacom components). Due to changed market conditions the manufacturing cost exceeded the value in use. This was the reason for the impairment. All impairment losses recognised during 2007, 2006 and 2005 are included in research and development costs in the income statement. Government grants In 2007, the cost of machinery and equipment was reduced by kEUR 17 (2006: kEUR 622, 2005: kEUR 1,070), because of government grants. Of that amount, kEUR 0 (2006: kEUR 94, 2005: kEUR 648) has been accrued as receivable and kEUR 17 (2006: kEUR 528, 2005: kEUR 422) was paid in cash.

These assets are included in additions through business combinations for 2005. In 2007 the acquisition of Nanoinstruments Ltd resulted in the addition of that company's product and technology know-how. Customer base and product and technology know how are amortised over a period of between four and F-25 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 13. Intangible assets (Continued) four to six years respectively.

It relates to additions to patents and production methods in 2005. Due to changed market conditions in respect of these intangible assets it was not possible to reliably determine the economic benefit to be received in future periods. As a result an impairment loss was recognised. Furthermore during 2005, market studies showed that the sales markets for specific AIXTRON technologies will be available to the Company only at a date later than previously anticipated. Considering this fact, AIXTRON performed an impairment test for developed technologies acquired from Genus in 2005. On the basis of these tests an impairment of kEUR 5,680 to the lower value in use was recognised in 2005. In 2005, AIXTRON also realised an impairment loss of kEUR 1,866 on the customer base acquired from Genus as the flows of economic benefit attributable to these customers at the balance sheet date no longer reflect the original planning at the date of acquisition. In the fiscal years 2006 and 2007, no further impairment losses were required No reversals were made in 2007, 2006 or 2005. F-26 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 13. Intangible assets (Continued) The amortisation expected to be charged on other intangible assets in the future years is as follows: (in EUR thousands) 2008 3,224 2009 3,195 2010 3,185 2011 1,879 2012 667 The actual amortisation can differ from the expected amortisation. Impairment of goodwill The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date by entity is as follows: 2007 2006 (in EUR thousands) AIXTRON, Inc. 45,507 50,807 AIXTRON Ltd. 11,489 12,267 Epigress AB 1,791 1,791 AIXTRON KK 187 187 58,974 65,052 The impairment test for cash generating units is based on projections of cash flows on the basis of the latest business plan. To evaluate the present value AIXTRON estimated the cash inflows for the period following the planning period of three to five years by carrying forward an estimated growth rate, which is based on individual market studies, for the following years. The value in use for each cash generating unit was calculated, using a discounted cash flow. A pre-tax discount rate of 15% for Genus and 13% for other cash generating units was applied in discounting the projected cash flows. The resulting value in use was compared to the carrying amount of the cash generating unit. In 2007 and 2006 no impairment of goodwill was required. In 2005 the comparison of the carrying amount with the value in use showed that an impairment of the Genus goodwill of kEUR 13,705 was needed. 14. Investment property The net book value at the balance sheet date of investment property amounted to kEUR 4,908 (2006: kEUR 4,908). Investment property relates to undeveloped land held for a purpose not yet determined. It may be used for a possible extension of production capacity. The carrying amount is determined using the cost model. The fair value is equal to the carrying amount. The fair value of the land at December 31, 2007 was determined using related standard land values. 15. Other non-current assets Other non-current assets totalling kEUR 745 (2006: kEUR 671) include mainly rent deposits for buildings. F-27 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 16.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets for entities which have made a loss in either the current or preceding year was kEUR 623 (2006: kEUR 5,599). Deferred taxes for tax losses in the amount of kEUR 39,117 (2006: kEUR 57,355) and on deductible temporary differences in the amount of kEUR 18,542 (2006: kEUR 11,748) were not recognised. Tax losses in the amount of kEUR 5,044 can be used indefinitely (2006: kEUR 18,761), kEUR 6,688 expire by 2012 (2006: 8,290 by 2011) and kEUR 27,385 expire after 2012 (2006: kEUR 30,304 after 2011).

All effects that result from these tax changes have been included in the results for the year ended December 31, 2007. As a consequence of the lower German tax rates, the value of deferred tax assets reduced by EUR 1.5 m. This has been expensed as a tax charge in the Income Statement. 17. Long-term receivables from current tax Long-term receivables from current tax include a receivable from corporate tax which will be refunded in equal payments over a period of ten years. The payments can be claimed at the beginning of each calendar year, starting January 1, 2008. The amount included in long-term receivables is for the amounts receivable after more than one year from the balance sheet date. F-29 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 18.

Trade receivables and other current receivables (Continued) Additions to allowances on trade receivables are included in other operating expenses, releases of allowances are included in other operating income. Allowances on receivables developed as follows: 2007 2006 (in EUR thousands) Allowance at January 1 311 445 Translation adjustments (8 ) (17 ) Impairment losses recognised 412 199 Used (35 ) (262 ) Impairment losses reversed (113 ) (54 ) Allowance at December 31 567 311 Due to the worldwide spread of risks, there is a diversification of the credit risk for trade receivables. Generally, the Company demands no securities for financial assets. In accordance with usual business practice for capital equipment however, the Company mitigates its exposure to credit risk by requiring payment by irrevocable letters of credit and substantial payments in advance from most customers as conditions of contracts for sale of major items of equipment. At the balance sheet date two customers accounted for 18% and 12% respectively of the company's net trade receivables, no other single customer accounted for more than 10% of trade receivables. In 2006 three customers accounted for 19%, 11% and 10% respectively of trade receivables, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of receivables. In determining concentrations of credit risk the company defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are connected entities. Included in the Company's trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of kEUR 4,987 (2006: kEUR 23,726) which are past due at the reporting date for which the Company has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and, although the company has no collateral, the amounts are still considered recoverable. 2007 2006 (in EUR thousands) 1-90 days past due 4,096 20,924 More than 90 days past due 891 2,802 20.

Each share represents a portion of the share capital in the amount of EUR 1.00. Treasury shares were contributed into a trust, as part of the Genus acquisition for the exercise of Genus stock and other options and for conversion of bonds. AIXTRON AG cannot dispose of the trust assets. Contrary to German Commercial Code and Company Law, IFRS (SIC 12) prescribes an allocation of the trust assets to AIXTRON AG. In the IFRS financial statements the shares held in this trust are therefore shown as treasury shares and deducted from the stated share capital. Both the authorised capital I and the authorised capital II have remained unchanged compared to December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, AIXTRON AG's Executive Board is authorised: to increase, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, AIXTRON's stated share capital at any time or from time to time on or before May 17, 2010 by up to EUR 35,919,751 by issuing against either cash contribution or contribution in kind new registered no-par value shares with a proportional amount of EUR 1.00 per share in the share capital (Authorised Capital I). In this event, the shareholders must be granted a pre-emptive right. However, the Executive Board is authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude, in whole or in part, the shareholders' pre-emptive right. to increase, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, AIXTRON's stated share capital at any time or from time to time on or before May 17, 2010 by up to EUR 8,979,937 by issuing against cash contributions new registered shares without par value with a proportional amount of EUR 1.00 per share in the share capital (Authorised Capital II). In this case, the shareholders must be granted a pre-emptive right. However, the Executive Board is authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude, in whole or in part, the shareholders' pre-emptive right. The Executive Board is also authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to define the rights embodied in a share and the other conditions and terms of the issuance of shares. Paid-in capital Paid-in capital mainly includes the premium on increases of subscribed capital as well as cumulative expense for share-based payments.

Employee benefits Defined contribution plan The Company grants retirement benefits to qualified employees through various defined contribution pension plans. The expenses incurred for defined contribution plans mainly arise from two pension plans in subsidiaries. The contributions made do not exceed 10% of qualified employees' base salaries. In 2007 the expense recognised for defined contribution plans amounted to kEUR 824 (2006: kEUR 701, 2005: kEUR 151). Defined benefit plan The Company's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans reflects commitments to two former members of the Executive Board of AIXTRON AG. These are final salary plans.

The Company assumes that there will be no pension payments in the next ten years. The value of the obligations from pension plans is determined annually at December 31. 25. Share-based payment The Company has different fixed option plans which reserve shares of common stock and AIXTRON American Depository Shares (ADS) for issuance to members of the Executive Board, management and employees of the Company. Each AIXTRON ADS represents the beneficial ownership in one AIXTRON common share. The following is a description of these plans: AIXTRON stock option plan 1999 In May 1999, options were authorized to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock (after giving effect to capital increases, stock splits, and the EURO conversion). The options were exercisable in equal instalments of 25% per year after the second anniversary of the date of grant, subject to certain conditions. Vested options were only permitted to be exercised when the performance of the AIXTRON stock exceeds the performance of the Technology AS Price Index (formerly the New Market Index) by at least 5% in the reference period or when the turnover reported by AIXTRON rose by at least 25% per year and the profit/revenue ratio was at least 12%. The period when the exercise of the options under those conditions could take place has now lapsed. Regardless of fulfilment of the conditions, the stock options can be exercised when 15 years have elapsed since their issue. Under the terms of the 1999 plan, options were granted at prices equal to the average closing price over the last 20 trading days on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange before the grant date. All options are settled by physical delivery of shares. Upon exercise of options new shares are issued. Under this plan 1,203,273 options for the purchase of 1,878,418 commons shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2007. In 2002, options were granted with the exercise price slightly less than fair market value. Fair market value is determined based upon the closing trading price on grant date. AIXTRON stock option plan 2002 In May 2002, options were authorized to purchase 3,511,495 shares of common stock. The options are exercisable in equal instalments of 25% per year after the second anniversary of the date of grant, subject to certain conditions. Options expire ten years from date of grant. Under the terms of the 2002 F-35 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 25. Share-based payment (Continued) plan, options are granted at prices equal to the average closing price over the last 20 trading days on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange before the grant date, plus a premium of 20% over the average closing price. No grants were issued with a strike price less than fair market value. All options are settled by physical delivery of shares. Upon exercise of options new shares are issued. A total of 2,365,509 options to purchase the same number of common stock were outstanding under this plan as of December 31, 2007. AIXTRON stock option plan 2007 Under the AIXTRON Stock Option Plan 2007, 759,100 Share Options were granted which are authorized to purchase 759,100 shares of common stock. 50% of the granted options may be executed after a waiting period of not less than two years, further 25% after three years and the remaining 25% after at least four years. The options expire 10 years after they have been granted. Under the terms of the 2007 plan, options are granted at prices equal to the average closing price over the last 20 trading days on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange before the grant date. Genus stock option plan 2000 With the acquisition of Genus, Inc. the company adopted the Genus Incentive Stock Option Plan 2000. Under this plan at the date of acquisition options were authorized to purchase 3,948,014 shares of common stock. At the date of acquisition these were converted into options to purchase 2,013,487 AIXTRON ADS. Options granted before October 3, 2003 vest over a three-year-period and expire five years from the date of grant. Options granted after October 3, 2003 vest over a four-year-period and expire in ten years from the date of grant. A total of 247.099 options to purchase AIXTRON ADS were outstanding under this plan as of December 31, 2007. Upon exercise of options new shares are issued from the trust (see note 22).

Share-based payment (Continued) The weighted-average share price of the options exercised was US$ 5.39. The intrinsic value of options exercised amounted to kUSD 3,548. The employees of Genus Inc. held 484,508 stock options representing the right to receive 247,099 ADS of AIXTRON AG as of December 31, 2007. As part of the Genus, Inc. transaction, a trust for the employee stock options of Genus Inc. was set up, into which ADS of AIXTRON AG were deposited after the capital increase on March 14, 2005.

The fair value of the stock options is determined on the basis of a binomial lattice model. In accordance with IFRS 2 the measurement includes only options which were granted after November 7, 2002. In 2007, the personnel expenses from share-based payments were kEUR 1,250 (2006: kEUR 1,450; 2005: kEUR 1,801). As at December 31, 2007 an amount of kEUR 4,872 relating to stock options granted prior to that date has not yet been recognised as a personnel expense. This amount will be charged over the period to 2012. The expected allocation of the expense is as follows: 2008: kEUR 1,928, 2009: kEUR 1,643, 2010: kEUR 883 and after 2011: kEUR 418.

Financial instruments Details of the significant accounting policies and methods, the basis of measurement that are used in preparing the financial statements and the other accounting policies that are relevant to an understanding of the financial statement are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements. Financial risk management objectives The group seeks to minimise the effects of any risk that may occur from any financial transaction. Key aspects are the exposures to liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and currency risk arising in the normal course of the Company's business. The Aixtron Group's central management co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial institutions and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the F-39 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 29. Financial instruments (Continued) Group through internal risk reports which analyse exposure to risk by likelihood and magnitude. These risks cover all aspects of the business, including financial risks, and the risk management system is in accordance with the corporate governance recommendations specified in the German Corporate Governance Code. Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Liquidity risks At 31 December 2007, the Company had no borrowings (2006 nil) and kEUR 71,943 in cash and cash equivalents (2006 kEUR 46,751). Credit risks Financial assets generally exposed to a credit risk are trade receivables (see note 19) and cash and cash equivalents. The Company's cash and cash equivalents are kept with banks which have a good reputation. Market risks The company's activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate risks. The company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Cash deposits are made with the company's bankers at the market rates prevailing at inception of the deposit for the period and currency concerned. There has been no change to the Company's exposure to market risk or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk. Foreign currency risk The Company enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including forward exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the export of equipment. The main exchange rates giving rise to the risk are those between the U.S. dollar, pound sterling and Euro. The carrying amounts of the Group's foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Liabilities Assets 2007 2006 2007 2006 (kEUR) (kEUR) (kEUR) (kEUR) US Dollars (34,536 ) (22,193 ) 37,070 33,075 GB Pounds (7,140 ) (5,897 ) 5,655 2,088 Exposures are reviewed on a regular basis and are managed by the Company through sensitivity analysis. Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The company is mainly exposed to US Dollar and Pound Sterling exchange rate risks through its worldwide activities. F-40 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 29. Financial instruments (Continued) The following table details the company's sensitivity analysis to a 10% increase in the value of the Euro against the dollar and pound. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity, a negative number indicates a reduction in profit and other equity. USD Currency impact GBP Currency impact 2007 2006 2007 2006 (kEUR) (kEUR) (kEUR) (kEUR) Profit or loss (2,996 ) (1,259 ) 48 313 Other equity 757 (6,071 ) (5,511 ) (2,879 ) The sensitivity analysis represents the foreign exchange risk at the year end date only. It is calculated by revaluing the Group's financial assets and liabilities, existing at 31 December, denominated in US Dollars or British Pounds, by 10%. It does not represent the effect of a 10% change in exchange rates sustained over the whole of the financial year, only the effect of a different rate occuring on the last day of the year. Forward foreign exchange contracts The company enters forward foreign exchange contracts to cover receipts from highly probable forecast sales denominated in US dollars. The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Foreign Currency Contract Amount Fair Value 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 ($000s) ($000s) (kEUR) (kEUR) (kEUR) (kEUR) Cash flow hedges Sell US Dollars buy Euros Less than 3 months 17,700  12,816  828  3 to 12 months 19,000  13,909  1,047  Sell US Dollars buy GB pounds Less than 3 months 21,000 4,500 14,293 3,603 28 183 3 to 12 months 63,000 13,500 42,880 10,810 (166 ) 530 Fair Value Hedges through the Profit or Loss Options to sell US Dollars buy Euros Less than 3 months 10,600  7,153  242  3 to 12 months 23,900  16,129  628  Options to sell US Dollars buy GB pounds Less than 3 months 12,000  8,168  (109 )  3 to 12 months 36,000  24,503  (666 )  Sell US Dollars buy Euros Less than 3 months  21,000  15,984  95 3 to 12 months  19,000  14,356  47 Foreign currency cash flow hedges At December 31, 2007, the aggregate amount of unrealised gains on forward foreign exchange contracts deferred in the hedging reserve relating to the exposure on these anticipated future transactions is kEUR 1,191 (2006 kEUR 519). It is anticipated that the sales will take place during 2008 at which stage the amount deferred in equity will be released into profit or loss.

Financial instruments (Continued) The unrealised gains of kEUR 519 (December 31, 2005: losses (kEUR 377) included in income and expenses recognised in equity as of December 31, 2006 were fully reversed and recognised in income statement at maturity date of the contracts in the financial year. The gains actually realised in 2007 were kEUR 1,001 (2006: losses kEUR 149. Foreign currency option contracts The company has also entered into option contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk on US dollar sales proceeds in 2008. The contracts are classified as at fair value through the profit and loss account. Unrealised losses of kEUR 870 (2006 unrealised gains kEUR 142) on forward exchange contracts are recognised in Other Operating Income in the profit and loss statement.

Under most of the lease commitments for office and plant facilities the Company has options to renew the leasing contracts. The leases typically run for a period between one and fifteen years. None of the leases include contingent rentals. The expenses for leasing contracts were kEUR 1,944, kEUR 2,004 and kEUR 2,075 for 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. 31. Capital commitments As of December 31, 2007, the Company had entered into purchase commitments with suppliers in the amount of kEUR 49,223 (2006: kEUR 23,377) for purchases within the next 12 months. Commitments for capital expenditures are kEUR 2,840 (2006: kEUR 44) as of December 31, 2007. 32. Contingencies The Company is involved in various legal proceedings or can be exposed to a threat of legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Executive Board regularly analyses these matters, considering any possibilities of avoiding legal proceedings or of covering potential damages under insurance contracts and has recognised, where required, appropriate provisions. The Company grants to individual customers advance payment guarantees generally existing only for a limited period of time and reflecting normal business conduct. It is not expected that such matters will have a material effect on the Company's net assets, results of operations and financial position.

Additional costs of kEUR 5,775 already incurred in 2004 in connection with the acquisition of Genus in 2005 were shown as other non-current assets in 2004 and were therefore included in cash flows from operating activities. In 2005, further purchase related costs of kEUR 3,628 were capitalised. These are recognised in cash flows from investing activities. (ii) Financing activity The liabilities from convertible bonds assumed as part of the acquisition of Genus Inc. were fully settled in 2005 by issuing equity instruments (ADS) (see note 28). In this context, no payments were required. 39.

Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The preparation of AIXTRON's Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Company to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable based upon the F-47 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 41. Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation and uncertainty (Continued) information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and are made in order to fairly present the Company's financial position and results of operations. The following accounting policies are significantly impacted by these estimates and judgments that AIXTRON believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results include the following: Revenue Recognition Revenue is generally recognised in two stages for the supply of equipment to customers, partly on delivery and partly on final installation and acceptance (see note 2 (p)). The Company believes, based on past experience, that this method of recognising revenue fairly states the revenues of the Company. Goodwill As stated in the accounting policies, the Company tests at least annually whether goodwill has suffered impairment. If there is an indication, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit has to be estimated. This is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. The determination of the value in use involves making adjustments and estimates relate to the projection and discounting of future cash flows. Although the Company believes the assumptions used to calculate recoverable amount are appropriate, any unforeseen changes in these assumptions could result in impairment charges to goodwill which could adversely affect the future financial position and operating results. Valuation of Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. This requires the Company to make judgments concerning obsolescence of materials. This evaluation requires estimates, including both forecasted product demand and pricing environment, both of which may be susceptible to significant change. In future periods, write-downs of inventory may be necessary due to (1) reduced demand in the markets in which the Company operates, (2) technological obsolescence due to rapid developments of new products and technological improvements, or (3) changes in economic or other events and conditions that impact the market price for the Company's products. These factors could result in adjustment to the valuation of inventory in future periods, and significantly impact the Company's future operating results. Income Taxes At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses whether the realisation of future tax benefits is sufficiently probable to recognise deferred tax assets. This assessment requires the exercise of judgment on the part of management with respect to future taxable income. The recorded amount of total deferred tax assets could be reduced if estimates of projected future taxable income are lowered, or if changes in current tax regulations are enacted that impose restrictions on the timing or extent of the Company's ability to utilize future tax benefits.
