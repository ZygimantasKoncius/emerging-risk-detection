D. Risk Factors” or in other parts of this Annual Report. 29 Overview Our primary business is the provision of domestic, regional (which includes Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) and international passenger and cargo airline services. Our overall capacity on an available tonne kilometer, or ATK, basis increased by 5.7%, from 18,662.5 ATKs in 2011 to 19,721.4 ATKs in 2012, and our passenger capacity on an available seat kilometer, or ASK, basis increased by 6.9%, from 127,890.8 ASKs in 2011 to 136,724.0 ASKs in 2012. Total traffic on a revenue tonne kilometer, or RTK, basis increased by 7.5%, from 13,402.1 RTKs in 2011 to 14,406.5 RTKs in 2012. The historical results of operations discussed in this Annual Report may not be indicative of our future operating performance. Like those of other airlines, our operations depend substantially on overall passenger and cargo traffic volumes and are subject to seasonal and other variations that may influence passenger travel demand and cargo volume and may not be under our control, including unusual political events, changes in the domestic and global economies and other unforeseen events. Our operations will be affected by, among other things, fluctuations in aviation fuel prices, aircraft acquisition and leasing costs, maintenance expenses, take-off and landing charges, wages, salaries and benefits, other operating expenses and the rates of income taxes paid. Our financial performance is also significantly affected by factors associated with operating in a highly regulated industry, as well as a number of other external variables, including political and economic conditions in China, competition, foreign exchange fluctuations and public perceptions of the safety of air travel with Chinese airlines. Because nearly every aspect of our airline operations is subject to the regulation of the CAAC, our operating revenues and expenses are directly affected by the CAAC regulations with respect to, among other things, domestic airfares, level of commissions paid to sales agents, the aviation fuel price, take-off and landing charges and route allocations. The nature and extent of airline competition and the ability of Chinese airlines to expand are also significantly affected by various CAAC regulations and policies. Changes in the CAAC’s regulatory policies, or in the implementation of such policies, are therefore likely to have a significant impact on our future operations. Operating Segments The Company presents segment information in a manner that is similar to the management’s internal reporting. The Company is principally engaged in the operation of civil aviation, including the provision of passenger, cargo and other extended transportation services and are managed as a single business unit. The Company has one reportable operating segment, reported as “airline transportation operations”. See Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements. Acquisitions We entered into an agreement with Shanghai Airlines on July 10, 2009 to issue a maximum of 1,694,838,860 A Shares to the shareholders of Shanghai Airlines in exchange for all existing issued shares of Shanghai Airlines. The acquisition price was RMB9,118 million, which was determined based on the quoted market price of our shares issued as of the date nearest to the acquisition date, with adjustments to reflect specific restrictions to certain shares that were issued. On January 28, 2010, we completed the exchange of 1,694,838,860 A Shares for all existing issued shares of Shanghai Airlines and Shanghai Airlines became a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company.

Revenues increased in our passenger business operation, primarily due to increased passenger demand, aircraft utilization rates and increase in scheduled flights, while revenue decreased in our cargo and mail business operation, primarily due to a general slowdown of the global economy that affected cargo demand and, consequently, our cargo volumes. In 2012, we transported a total of 73,077 million passengers, representing an increase of 6.3%, from 68,725 million passengers in 2011. Our total passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs) increased by 8.1%, from 100,895 million passenger-kilometers in 2011 to 109,113 million passenger-kilometers in 2012 and our total cargo and mail traffic (as measured in RFTKs) increased by 6.3%, from 4,421 million freight tonne-kilometers in 2011 to 4,701 million freight tonne-kilometers in 2012. Our average yield for our passenger operations decreased by 4.4%, from RMB0.68 per passenger-kilometer in 2011 to RMB0.65 per passenger-kilometer in 2012 primarily due to increased yields resulting the PRC transportation industry-wise conversion from business tax to value-added tax, effective January 1, 2012. Our average yield for our cargo and mail operations decreased by 6.4%, from RMB1.83 per tonne-kilometer in 2011 to RMB1.71 per tonne-kilometer in 2012, primarily due to the general slowdown of the global economy that affected cargo demand and, consequently, our cargo volumes. The following chart sets forth our revenue breakdown for 2011 and 2012: 2012 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31, Increase % Increase 2011 2012 (Decrease) (Decrease) (in millions of RMB) Traffic revenues (1) 76,514 79,444 2,930 3.8 Passenger 68,434 71,419 2,985 4.4 Passenger revenue excluding fuel surcharges 60,383 61,038 655 1.1 Fuel surcharges 8,051 10,381 2,330 28.9 Cargo and mail 8,080 8,025 (55 ) (0.7 ) Cargo and mail revenue excluding fuel surcharges 5,482 5,237 (245 ) (4.5 ) Fuel surcharges 2,598 2,788 190 7.3 Others (2) 5,889 5,809 (80 ) (1.4 ) Total Operating Revenue 82,403 85,253 2,850 3.5 (1)Before January 1, 2012, the major elements of our revenues were subject to business tax levied at rates of 3% or 5%. Pursuant to the Notice of Exemption of Business Tax on the Provision of International Transportation Services (Cai Shui [2010] No. 8), jointly issued by the MOF and the SAT, our revenues from the provision of international transportation services were exempt from business tax as of January 1, 2010. Pursuant to the Notice of the Pilot Program for the Transformation of Transportation and Certain Modern Service Industries in Shanghai from Business Tax (“BT”) to Value Added Tax (“VAT”) (Cai Shui [2011] No. 111), issued by the MOF and SAT (the "Shanghai Notice"), traffic revenue of the Company and subsidiaries located in Shanghai and other revenues (including ground service income, cargo handling income, commission income and certain other income) generated in Shanghai are subjected to VAT levied at rates of 11% or 6% from January 1, 2012, rather than BT rates. Pursuant to the Notice of the Pilot Program for the Transformation of Transportation and Certain Modern Service Industries from BT to VAT in Beijing and Eight Other Provinces and Cities (Cai Shui [2012] No.71), issued by MOF and SAT (the "Beijing Notice" and collectively with the Shanghai Notice, the "Notices"), traffic revenue and other revenues (including ground service income, cargo handling income, commission income and certain other income) generated by subsidiaries located in Beijing and other eight provinces/cities included in the notice are subjected to VAT levied at rates of 11% or 6% with different effective date ranging from September 1, 2012 to December 1, 2012. VAT generated from purchase of fuel, take-off and landing services, food and beverages, property, plant and equipment, and certain BT paid by the branches of the Company that are beyond the scope of the Notices can be used to deduct the VAT output generated from taxable revenue. The traffic revenue and other revenue generated from operations located in other locations of China will continue to be subject to BT at rates of 3% or 5%. As a result of the implementation of aforementioned Notices and changes from BT to VAT, the relevant results of operations from the affected portions of our operations have been changed to VAT from BT. As such, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by RMB2,954 million and our operating expenses decreased by RMB3,132 million, which resulted in an increase in profit before income tax of RMB178 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. BT incurred and offset against revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 amounted to approximately RMB670 million (2011: approximately RMB1,803 million). (2)Includes ground service income, cargo handling income, commission income and others. Passenger revenues Our passenger traffic revenues increased by RMB2,985 million, or 4.4%, from RMB68,434 million in 2011 to RMB71,419 million in 2012. This increase was primarily due to increased passenger demand, aircraft utilization rates and increase in scheduled flights. Our domestic passenger traffic revenues (excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan passenger revenues), which accounted for 70.2% of our total passenger traffic revenues in 2012, increased by 2.4%, from RMB48,963 million in 2011 to RMB50,141 million in 2012. The increase was primarily due to increased flight capacity on domestic routes and steady demand from the continued growth of the PRC economy. Compared to 2011, our domestic passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs) increased by 7.4%, from 70,933 million in 2011 to 76,156 million in 2012. The number of passengers carried on domestic routes increased by 6.1%, from 58.8 million in 2011 to 62.4 million in 2012. Our passenger-kilometers yield for domestic routes decreased from RMB0.69 per passenger-kilometer in 2011 to RMB0.66 per passenger-kilometer in 2012. Our regional passenger traffic revenues (representing Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan passenger revenues) which accounted for 4.5% of our total passenger traffic revenues in 2012, increased by 4.7%, from RMB3,078 million in 2011 to RMB3,221 million in 2012. The increase was primarily due to increased ticket prices, which led to a increase of 1.1%, from 3,811 million in 2011 to 3,852 million in 2012, in our regional passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs). The number of passengers carried on Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan routes increased by 3.6%, from 2.7 million in 2011 to 2.8 million in 2012. Our passenger-kilometers yield for regional routes increased from RMB0.81 per passenger-kilometer in 2011 to RMB0.84 per passenger-kilometer in 2012. 31 International passenger traffic revenues, which accounted for 25.3% of our total passenger traffic revenues in 2012, increased by 10.2%, from RMB16,393 million in 2011 to RMB18,056 million in 2012. The increase was primarily due to increased international passenger demand, increased aircraft utilization rates and increase in our scheduled flights on international routes. Our international passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs) increased by 11.3% in 2011, from 26,151 million in 2011 to 29,105 million in 2012. The number of passengers carried on international routes increased by 9.1%, from 7.2 million in 2011 to 7.9 million in 2012. Our passenger-kilometers yield for international routes decreased from RMB0.63 per passenger-kilometer in 2011 to RMB0.62 per passenger-kilometer in 2012. Cargo and mail revenues Our cargo and mail traffic revenues decreased by 0.7%, from RMB8,080 million in 2011 to RMB8,025 million in 2012, which accounted for 9.4% of our total operating revenues in 2012. Revenue from cargo and mail traffic via belly-hold cargo space on the Company’s passenger aircraft was RMB2,389 million, which accounted for 29.8% of total freight revenue and 3.0% of total traffic revenue in 2012. Cargo and mail yield decreased from RMB1.83 in 2011 to RMB1.71 in 2012 per cargo tonne-kilometer, or 6.56% compared to the same period in 2011, primarily as a result of the general slowdown of the global economy that affected cargo volumes. Our domestic cargo and mail traffic revenues (excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau cargo and mail revenues), which accounted for 16.6% of our total cargo and mail traffic revenues in 2012, decreased by 1.3%, from RMB1,350 million in 2011 to RMB1,332 million in 2012. This decrease was primarily due to the increased competition from other cargo carriers which resulted in decreased shipping fees and cargo and mail volume. Our freight tonne-kilometers yield for domestic routes remained RMB1.44 per tonne-kilometer in 2011 and 2012. Our regional cargo and mail traffic revenues (representing Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan cargo and mail traffic revenues), which accounted for 5.7% of our total cargo and mail traffic revenues in 2012, decreased by 30.9%, from RMB666 million in 2011 to RMB461 million in 2012. This decrease was primarily due to decreased demand in the regional cargo and mail freight market as a result of the general slowdown of the regional freight market. Our freight tonne-kilometers yield for regional routes decreased from RMB4.49 per tonne-kilometer to RMB3.94 per tonne-kilometer. International cargo and mail traffic revenues, which accounted for 77.7% of our total cargo and mail traffic revenues in 2012, increased by 2.6%, from RMB6,064 million in 2011 to RMB6,233 million in 2012, due to increased demand in the international freight market as a result of the gradual recovery of global economy. Our prices for cargo and mail transportation on international routes also decreased as our freight tonne-kilometers yield for international routes decreased from RMB1.82 per tonne-kilometer in 2011 to RMB1.70 per tonne-kilometer in 2012. Other revenues We also generated revenues from other services, including airport ground services, cargo handling services and ticket handling services. These services include loading and unloading of cargo, aircraft cleaning and ground transportation of cargo and passenger luggage for aircraft arriving at or departing from Hongqiao International Airport and Pudong International Airport of Shanghai. We are currently the principal provider of airport ground services at both Hongqiao International Airport and Pudong International Airport. Our total other revenues decreased by 1.4%, from RMB5,889 million in 2011 to RMB5,809 million in 2012. Operating Expenses The following chart sets forth a breakdown of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012: 2012 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31, Increase % increase 2011 2012 (decrease) (decrease) (in millions of RMB) Operating Expenses: Aircraft fuel expenses 29,229 29,872 643 2.2 Gain on fair value movements of derivatives financial instruments (87 ) (25 ) 62 (71.4 ) Takeoff and landing charges 8,350 9,066 716 8.6 Depreciation and amortization 6,966 7,557 591 8.5 Wages, salaries and benefits 8,665 10,059 1,394 16.1 Office, administration and others 8,854 8,983 129 1.5 Aircraft maintenance 4,406 4,433 27 0.6 Aircraft operating lease expenses 4,128 4,438 310 7.5 Impairment losses for assets 638 (13 ) (651 ) (102.0 ) Selling and marketing expenses 3,740 3,727 (13 ) (0.3 ) Other 4,403 4,648 245 5.6 Total Operating Expense 79,292 82,745 3,453 4.4 (1) Due to the implementation of the pilot program for the transformation from business tax to value-added tax regarding the transportation industry, certain expenses in 2012 are not comparable to the corresponding expenses in 2011. Our total operating expenses increased by 4.4%, from RMB79,292 million in 2011 to RMB82,745 million in 2012 primarily due to the expansion of our business which is in line with the increase of our fleet size. Our total operating expenses as a percentage of our revenues slightly increased from 96.2% in 2011 to 97.1% in 2012. Aircraft fuel expenses increased by 2.2%, from RMB29,229 million in 2011 to RMB29,872 million (based on value-added tax) in 2012. The increase was primarily due to our business expansion and the increase of average aircraft fuel price by 2.1% compared with that of 2011. In 2012, we consumed a total of approximately 4.2 million tonnes of aviation fuel, representing an increase of 7.2% compared to 2011. Aircraft fuel expenses accounted for 36.1% of our total operating expenses in 2012, as compared to 36.9% in 2011. We implemented a policy of transforming business tax to value-added tax in 2012. If calculated in line with the business tax, aviation fuel costs for 2012 will be increased by 9.5% from 2011, and the impact of the increase in the jet fuel price on aviation fuel expenditures was approximately RMB671 million. The increase in aviation fuel consumption resulted in an increase in aviation fuel expenditures of approximately RMB2,111 million. Changes in fair value of financial derivatives decreased from a gain of RMB87 million in 2011 to a gain of RMB25 million in 2012. The difference was mainly due to the decrease in gains arising from fair value movement of crude oil option contracts, which was resulted from a decrease in the notional amount of unsettled crude oil option. In 2012, the net gain on change in fair value of crude oil option contracts (inclusive of cash outflow upon settlement) was approximately RMB9 million. In 2012, the fair value movements of financial derivatives charged to the income statement accounted for 0.03% of our total operating expenses.Take-off and landing charges, which accounted for 11.0% of our total operating expenses in 2012, increased by 8.6%, from RMB8,350 million in 2011 to RMB9,066 million in 2012, primarily due to an increase in the number of take-off and landings, as well as an increase in average unit price of take-off and landing charges. 32 Depreciation and amortization increased by 8.5%, from RMB6,966 in 2011 to RMB7,557 million in 2012, primarily due to the addition of new aircraft and engines by the Group in 2012, resulting in a greater base number for depreciation and amortisation. Wages, salaries and benefits, which accounted for 12.2% of our total operating expenses in 2012, increased by 16.1%, from RMB8,665 million in 2011 to RMB10,059 million in 2012, primarily due to an increase in the number of staff and the increase in hours flown. Office, administration and other expenses increased by 1.5%, from RMB8,854 million in 2011 to RMB8,983 million in 2012, primarily due to the expansion of our overall business operations and an increase in the number of staff. Aircraft maintenance expenses, which accounted for 5.4% of our total operating expenses in 2012, increased by 0.6%, from RMB4,406 million in 2011 to RMB4,433 million in 2012, primarily due to an increase in the number of aircraft held through an operating lease in 2012. Aircraft operating lease expenses increased by 7.5%, from RMB4,128 million in 2011 to RMB4,438 million in 2012, primarily due to an increase in the number of aircraft that we operate under operating leases. Impairment losses for assets decreased by 102.0%, from a loss of RMB638 million in 2011 to a reversal of RMB13 million in 2012. Selling and marketing expenses, which accounted for 4.5% of our total operating expenses in 2012, decreased by 0.33%, from RMB3,740 million in 2011 to RMB3,727 million in 2012. Other Operating Income Our other operating income and other gains were primarily generated from government subsidies. The total amount of our other operating income and other gains increased from RMB1,061 million in 2011 to RMB1,720 million in 2012, primarily due to an increase in government subsidy income in 2012. Other government subsidies represent subsidies granted to us by the PRC government and local governments as well as other subsidies granted by various local municipalities to encourage our Company to operate certain routes to cities where these municipalities are located. Net Finance Costs In 2012, our finance income was RMB349 million, a decrease of RMB1,675 million from the same period last year, primarily due to the minimal appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar in 2012, which had substantially appreciated in 2011. Finance costs amounted to RMB1,697 million, an increase of RMB235 million, primarily due to an increase in interest expenses arising from increased borrowings and finance leases. Profit attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company As a result of the foregoing, the net profit attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company decreased to RMB2,954 million in 2012, or 35.5%, as compared to a net profit of RMB4,576 million in 2011. Fixed Assets Our Company had approximately RMB82,519 million of fixed assets and construction in progress as of December 31, 2012, including, among other assets, aircraft, engines and flight equipment, representing a 11.9% increase from RMB73,758 million in 2011. 2011 Compared to 2010 Revenues Our revenues increased by 11.7%, from RMB73,804 million in 2010 to RMB82,403 million in 2011 (net of the applicable PRC business tax). Revenues increased in our passenger business operation, primarily due to increased passenger demand, aircraft utilization rates and increase in scheduled flights, while revenue decreased in our cargo and mail business operation, primarily due to the general slowdown of the global economy that affected cargo volumes. In 2011, we transported a total of 68,725 million passengers, representing an increase of 5.8%, from 64,930 million passengers in 2010. Our total passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs) increased by 8.3%, from 93,153 million passenger-kilometers in 2010 to 100,895 million passenger-kilometers in 2011 and our total cargo and mail traffic (as measured in RFTKs) increased by 2.6%, from 4,308 million freight tonne-kilometers in 2010 to 4,421 million freight tonne-kilometers in 2011. Our average yield for our passenger operations increased by 7.9%, from RMB0.63 per passenger-kilometer in 2010 to RMB0.68 per passenger-kilometer in 2011 primarily due to increased passenger demand, aircraft utilization rates and increase in scheduled flights. Our average yield for our cargo and mail operations decreased by 6.2%, from RMB1.95per tonne-kilometer in 2010 to RMB1.83 per tonne-kilometer in 2011, primarily due to the general slowdown of the global economy that affected cargo volumes. The following chart sets forth our revenue breakdown for 2010 and 2011: 2011 vs. 2010 Year Ended December 31, Increase % Increase 2010 2011 (Decrease) (Decrease) (in millions of RMB) Traffic revenues (1) 67,391 76,514 9,123 13.5 Passenger 58,968 68,434 9,466 16.1 Passenger revenue excluding fuel surcharges 54,625 60,383 5,758 10.5 Fuel surcharges 4,343 8,051 3,708 85.4 Cargo and mail 8,423 8,080 (343 ) (4.1 ) Cargo and mail revenue excluding fuel surcharges 5,810 5,482 (328 ) (5.6 ) Fuel surcharges 2,613 2,598 (15 ) (0.6 ) Others (2) 6,413 5,794 (619 ) (10.4 ) Total Operating Revenue 73,804 82,403 8,599 11.7 (1) Pursuant to relevant tax rules and regulations in the PRC, the major elements of the Company’s traffic revenues, commission income, ground service income, cargo handling income and other revenues are subject to business tax levied at rates of 3% or 5%. Pursuant to the notice of exemption of business tax on the provision of international transportation services (Cai Shui [2010] No. 8), jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance and the State Tax Bureau, our revenues from the provision of international transportation services were exempt from business tax as of 1 January 2010. The business tax incurred and set off against the above revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 amounted to approximately RMB1,803 million (2010: RMB1,463 million). 33 (2)Includes ground service income, cargo handling income, commission income and others. Passenger revenues Our passenger traffic revenues increased by RMB9,466 million, or 16.1%, from RMB58,968 million in 2010 to RMB68,434 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to increased passenger demand, aircraft utilization rates and increase in scheduled flights. Our domestic passenger traffic revenues (excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan passenger revenues), which accounted for 71.6% of our total passenger traffic revenues in 2011, increased by 16.2%, from RMB42,143 million in 2010 to RMB48,963 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to increased ticket prices, increased flight capacity on domestic routes and steady demand from the continued growth of the PRC economy. Compared to 2010, our domestic passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs) increased by 7.0%, from 66,310 million in 2010 to 70,933 million in 2011. The number of passengers carried on domestic routes increased by 6.0%, from 55.5 million in 2010 to 58.8 million in 2011. Our passenger-kilometers yield for domestic routes increased from RMB0.64 per passenger-kilometer in 2010 to RMB0.69 per passenger-kilometer in 2011. Our regional passenger traffic revenues (representing Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan passenger revenues) which accounted for 4.5% of our total passenger traffic revenues in 2011, decreased by 3.1%, from RMB3,176 million in 2010 to RMB3,078 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to reduced flight capacity on our Hong Kong routes resulting from reduced flights to and from Hong Kong, as well as increased competition on our Hong Kong routes, which led to a decrease of 6.5%, from 4,074 million in 2010 to 3,811 million in 2011, in our regional passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs). The number of passengers carried on Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan routes decreased by 5.5%, from 2.9 million in 2010 to 2.7 million in 2011. Our passenger-kilometers yield for regional routes increased from RMB0.78 per passenger-kilometer in 2010 to RMB0.81 per passenger-kilometer in 2011. International passenger traffic revenues, which accounted for 24.0% of our total passenger traffic revenues in 2011, increased by 20.1%, from RMB13,650 million in 2010 to RMB16,393 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to increased international passenger demand, increased aircraft utilization rates and increase in our scheduled flights on international routes. Our international passenger traffic (as measured in RPKs) increased by 14.9% in 2011, from 22,769 million in 2010 to 26,151 million in 2011. The number of passengers carried on international routes increased by 9.8%, from 6.6 million in 2010 to 7.2 million in 2011. Our passenger-kilometers yield for international routes increased from RMB0.60 per passenger-kilometer in 2010 to RMB0.63 per passenger-kilometer in 2011. Cargo and mail revenues Our cargo and mail traffic revenues decreased by 4.1%, from RMB8,423 million in 2010 to RMB8,080 million in 2011, which accounted for 10.6% of our total traffic revenues in 2011. Revenue from cargo and mail traffic via belly-hold cargo space on the Company’s passenger aircraft was RMB2,998 million, which accounted for 37.1% of total freight revenue and 3.9% of total traffic revenue in 2011. Cargo and mail yield decreased from RMB1.95 in 2010 to RMB1.83 in 2011 per cargo tonne-kilometer, or 6.2% compared to the same period in 2010, primarily as a result of the general slowdown of the global economy that affected cargo volumes. Our domestic cargo and mail traffic revenues (excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau cargo and mail revenues), which accounted for 16.7% of our total cargo and mail traffic revenues in 2011, increased by 7.4%, from RMB1,257 million in 2010 to RMB1,350 million in 2011. This increase was primarily due to the continued economic growth in China which resulted in increased cargo and mail volume and demand. Our freight tonne-kilometers yield for domestic routes increased from RMB1.28 per tonne-kilometer in 2010 to RMB1.44 per tonne-kilometer in 2011. Our regional cargo and mail traffic revenues (representing Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan cargo and mail traffic revenues), which accounted for 8.2% of our total cargo and mail traffic revenues in 2011, decreased by 5.7%, from RMB706 million in 2010 to RMB666 million in 2011. This decrease was primarily due to decreased demand in the regional cargo and mail freight market as a result of the general slowdown of the regional freight market. Our freight tonne-kilometers yield for regional routes decreased from RMB4.54 per tonne-kilometer to RMB4.49 per tonne-kilometer. International cargo and mail traffic revenues, which accounted for 75.1% of our total cargo and mail traffic revenues in 2011, decreased by 6.1%, from RMB6,460 million in 2010 to RMB6,064 million in 2011, due to reduced demand in the international freight market as a result of decreased global economic activity . Our prices for cargo and mail transportation on international routes also increased as our freight tonne-kilometers yield for international routes decreased from RMB2.04 per tonne-kilometer in 2010 to RMB1.82 per tonne-kilometer in 2011. Other revenues We also generated revenues from other services, including airport ground services, cargo handling services and ticket handling services. These services include loading and unloading of cargo, aircraft cleaning and ground transportation of cargo and passenger luggage for aircraft arriving at or departing from Hongqiao International Airport and Pudong International Airport of Shanghai. We are currently the principal provider of airport ground services at both Hongqiao International Airport and Pudong International Airport. Our total other revenues decreased by 10.4%, from RMB6,413 million in 2010 to RMB5,749 million in 2011, as a result of decreased cargo handling income. Operating Expenses The following chart sets forth a breakdown of our operating expenses for the years 2010 and 2011: 2011 vs. 2010 Year Ended December 31, Increase % increase 2010 2011 (decrease) (decrease) (in millions of RMB) Operating Expenses: Aircraft fuel expenses 21,606 29,229 7,623 35.3 Gain on fair value movements of derivatives financial instruments (833 ) (87 ) 746 (89.6 ) Takeoff and landing charges 7,455 8,350 895 12.0 Depreciation and amortization 6,758 6,966 208 3.7 Wages, salaries and benefits 8,941 8,665 (276 ) (3.1 ) Office, administration and others 8,588 8,854 266 3.1 Aircraft maintenance 4,614 4,406 (208 ) (4.51 ) Aircraft operating lease expenses 3,976 4,128 153 3.9 Impairment losses for assets 405 638 233 57.5 Selling and marketing expenses 3,324 3,740 416 12.5 Other 3,931 4,403 472 12.0 Total Operating Expense 68,765 79,292 10,527 15.3 34 Our total operating expenses increased by 15.3%, from RMB68,765 million in 2010 to RMB79,292 million in 2011 primarily due to the substantial increase of the aircraft fuel expenses. Our total operating expenses as a percentage of our revenues increased from 93.2% in 2010 to 96.2% in 2011. Aircraft fuel expenses increased by 35.3%, from RMB21,606 million in 2010 to RMB29,229 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to our business expansion and the increase of average aircraft fuel price by 27.4% compared with that of 2010. In 2011, we consumed a total of approximately 3.9 million tonnes of aviation fuel, representing an increase of 6.2% compared to 2010. Aircraft fuel expenses accounted for 31.4% of our total operating expenses in 2011, as compared to 36.9% in 2010. Changes in fair value of financial derivatives decreased from a gain of RMB833 million in 2010 to a gain of RMB87 million in 2011. The difference was mainly due to the decrease in gains arising from fair value movement of crude oil option contracts, which was resulted from a decrease in the notional amount of unsettled crude oil option. In 2011, the net gain on change in fair value of crude oil option contracts (inclusive of cash outflow upon settlement) was approximately RMB67 million. In 2011, the fair value movements of financial derivatives charged to the income statement accounted for 0.1% of our total operating expenses. Take-off and landing charges, which accounted for 10.5% of our total operating expenses in 2011, increased by 12.0%, from RMB7,455 million in 2010 to RMB8,350 million in 2011, primarily due to an increase in scheduled flights. Depreciation and amortization increased by 3.1%, from RMB6,758 in 2010 to RMB6,966 million in 2011, primarily due to increased number of aircraft in our fleet and increased aircraft utilization rates, which resulted in the corresponding costs. Wages, salaries and benefits, which accounted for 10.9% of our total operating expenses in 2011, decreased by 3.1%, from RMB8,941 million in 2010 to RMB8,665 million in 2011, primarily due to reduced staff bonuses resulting from reduced operating profits in 2011, as well as various cost-saving measures that we implemented. Office, administration and other expenses increased by 3.1%, from RMB8,588 million in 2010 to RMB8,854 million in 2011, primarily due to the expansion of our overall business operations. Aircraft maintenance expenses, which accounted for 5.6% of our total operating expenses in 2011, decreased by 4.5%, from RMB4,614 million in 2010 to RMB4,406 million in 2011, primarily due to the reduced number of aircraft and engines that required scheduled major overhaul services. Aircraft operating lease expenses increased by 3.8%, from RMB3,976 million in 2010 to RMB4,128 million in 2011, primarily due to an increase in the number of aircraft that we operate under operating leases. Impairment losses for assets increased by 57.5%, from a loss of RMB405 million in 2010 to a loss of RMB638 million in 2011, primarily due to impairment provisions made for certain aircraft to be disposed of in 2012, which referenced the contracted selling price less costs to sell. We have planned to dispose of these aircraft in an effort to increase the operational efficiency of, and reduce the related maintenance fees for, our fleet. Selling and marketing expenses, which accounted for 4.7% of our total operating expenses in 2011, increased by 12.5%, from RMB3,324 million in 2010 to RMB3,740 million in 2011, primarily a result of increases in ticketing system service fees and agency handling fees due to increases in traffic revenue. Other Operating Income Our other operating income and other gains were primarily generated from government subsidies and gains on disposal of aircraft and relevant assets. The total amount of our other operating income and other gains increased from RMB658 million in 2010 to RMB1,061 million in 2011, primarily due to an increase in government subsidy income in 2011. Other government subsidies represent subsidies granted to us by the PRC government and local government as well as other subsidies granted by various local municipalities to encourage our Company to operate certain routes to cities where these municipalities are located. Net Finance Costs Our finance costs (net of finance income) decreased by 2.6%, from RMB1,502 million in 2010 to RMB1,463 million in 2011, primarily due to improvement in our capital structure and a reduction on the interest rates of our foreign currency borrowings. Approximately 69.1% of our indebtedness is U.S. dollar denominated borrowings, which are generally tied to LIBOR rates. In 2011, our finance income was RMB2,024 million, primarily due to the increase in exchange gain resulting from the appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. Profit / (Loss) attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company As a result of the foregoing, the net profit attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company increased to RMB4,576 million in 2011, representing a 7.7% decrease as compared to a net profit of RMB4,958 million in 2010. Fixed Assets Our Company had approximately RMB73,758 million of fixed assets and construction in progress as of December 31, 2011, including, among other assets, aircraft, engines and flight equipment, representing a 7.2% increase from RMB68,822 million in 2010. B.Liquidity and Capital Resources We typically finance our working capital requirements through a combination of funds generated from operations, short-term bank loans and the issuance of corporate bonds. As a result, our liquidity could be materially and adversely affected to the extent there is a significant decrease in demand for our services or if there is any delay in obtaining bank loans. 35 As of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, we had RMB3,078 million, RMB3,861 million and RMB2,512 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents; RMB38,566 million, RMB41,775 million and RMB45,736 million, respectively, in outstanding borrowings; and RMB1,486 million, RMB278 million and RMB69 million, respectively, in restricted bank deposits. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand and deposits that are placed with banks and other financial institutions. We plan to use the remaining available cash for other capital expenditures, including expenditures for aircraft, engines and related equipment, as well as for working capital and other day-to-day operating purposes. As of December 31, 2012, our accumulated losses amounted to approximately RMB5,426 million. In addition, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately RMB35,948 million. As a consequence, our Directors have taken active steps to seek additional sources of financing to improve our liquidity position. As of December 31, 2012, we had total credit facilities of RMB41.2 billion from various banks, of which RMB27.1 billion are not utilized. See the discussion below under “– Working Capital and Liabilities”. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term borrowings and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months. We may, however, require additional cash due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions that we may decide to pursue. Cash Flows from Operating Activities In 2012, we generated a net cash inflow from operating activities of RMB12,617 million as a result of cash generated from operations of RMB12,823 million less income tax we paid in 2012. Our cash generated from operations was mainly due to operating profit before working capital changes of RMB13,770 million and negative changes in working capital of RMB947 million. The operating profit before working capital changes of RMB13,770 million was a result of the profit before income tax of RMB3,012 million, mainly adjusted for: (i) depreciation of property, plant and equipment of RMB7,509 million, (ii) interest expenses of RMB1,697 million, (iii) consumption of flight equipment spare parts of RMB747 million, (iv) provision for return condition checks for aircraft and engines under operating leases of RMB793 million and partly offset by net foreign exchange gains of RMB201 million.

These negative changes were partly offset by (i) a decrease in restricted bank deposits and short-term bank deposits of RMB1,168 million, (ii) an increase in trade payables and notes payables of RMB388 million. . In 2011, we generated a net cash inflow from operating activities of RMB13,623 million as a result of cash generated from operations of RMB13,781 million less income tax we paid in 2011. Our cash generated from operations was mainly due to operating profit before working capital changes of RMB13,751 million and changes in working capital of RMB30 million. The operating profit before working capital changes of RMB13,751 million was a result of the profit before income tax of RMB4,841 million, mainly adjusted for: (i) depreciation of property, plant and equipment of RMB6,912 million, (ii) interest expenses of RMB1,463 million, (iii) consumption of flight equipment spare parts of RMB 740 million, (iv) provision for return condition checks for aircraft and engines under operating leases of RMB695 million and (v) impairment loss of RMB638 million, partly offset by net foreign exchange gains of RMB1,872 million.

Our cash generated from operations was mainly due to operating profit before working capital changes of RMB13,585 million and negative changes in working capital of RMB2,845 million. The operating profit before working capital changes of RMB13,585 million was a result of the profit before income tax of RMB5,418 million, mainly adjusted for: (i) depreciation of property, plant and equipment of RMB6,727 million, (ii) interest expenses of RMB1,502 million, (iii) consumption of flight equipment spare parts of RMB601 million, and (iv) provision for return condition checks for aircraft and engines under operating leases of RMB586 million, partly offset by (i) net foreign exchange gains of RMB1,075 million and (ii) gains arising from fair value movements of derivative financial instruments of RMB915 million. Negative changes in working capital mainly consisted of (i) a decrease in trade payables and notes payables of RMB3,418 million, (ii) a decrease in flight equipment and spare parts of RMB777 million and (iii) a decrease in provision for return condition checks for aircraft and engines under operating leases of RMB306 million. These negative changes were partly offset by (i) an increase in sales in advance of carriage of RMB847 million and (ii) an increase in other long-term liabilities of RMB570 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities In 2012, our net cash outflow from investing activities was RMB11,789 million. Our net cash outflow for investing activities mainly consisted of (i) advanced payments on acquisition of new aircraft of RMB7,329 million and (ii) increased property, plant and equipment of RMB6,148 million, primarily due to the purchase of 31 aircraft in 2012. These cash outflows were partly offset by (i) proceeds of short-term deposits with original maturities over three months of RMB958 million, (ii) interest received on bank deposit of RMB216 million, and (iii) proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment of RMB182 million. In 2011, our net cash outflow from investing activities was RMB14,939 million.

These cash outflows were partly offset by (i) net cash acquired through acquisition of Shanghai Airlines Co., Ltd, (ii) proceeds from disposal of non-current assets held for sale of RMB430 million and (iii) proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment of RMB102 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities In 2012, our net cash outflow from financing activities was RMB2,174 million. Our net cash outflow for financing activities mainly consisted of (i) repayments of short-term bank loans of RMB25,620 million, (ii) repayments of long-term bank loans of RMB8,352 million, (iii) principal repayments of financial lease obligations of RMB4,095 million, (iv) interest paid of RMB1,937 million, and (v) acquisition of non-controlling interests of RMB671 million. These cash outflows were partly offset by (i) proceeds from draw down of short-term bank loans of RMB23,101 million, (ii) proceeds from draw down of long-term bank loans of RMB10,887 million, (iii) proceeds from issuance of short-term debentures of RMB4,000 million, (iv) capital contribution from non-controlling interests of subsidiaries of RMB454 million and (v) receipts of restricted bank deposits of RMB236 million. 36 In 2011, our net cash inflow from financing activities was RMB2,136 million.

These cash outflows were partly offset by (i) proceeds from draw down of short-term bank loans of RMB20,803 million and (ii) proceeds from draw down of long-term bank loans of RMB11,556 million. Working Capital and Liabilities We have, and in the future may continue to have, substantial debts. In addition, we generally operate with a working capital deficit. As of December 31, 2012, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by RMB35,948 million. In comparison, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by RMB29,679 million as of December 31, 2011. The increase in our current liabilities in 2012 was primarily due to the increase in the current portion of borrowings. The decrease in our current assets in 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Short-term loans outstanding totaled RMB11,454 million and RMB12,880 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Long-term outstanding bank loans totaled RMB30,321 million and RMB32,856 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, our long-term debt to equity ratio was 1.34 to 1. The interest expenses associated with these debts may impair our future profitability. We expect that cash from operations and bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our operating cash flow requirements, although events that materially and adversely affect our operating results can also have a negative impact on liquidity. Our consolidated interest-bearing borrowings as of December 31, 2011 and 2012 for the purpose of calculating the indebtedness of our Company, were as follows: As of December 31, 2011 2012 (RMB in millions) Secured bank loans 14,185 18,393 Unsecured bank loans 27,590 27,343 Total 41,775 45,736 The maturity profile of interest-bearing borrowings of our Company as of December 31, 2011 and 2012 was as follows: As of December 31, 2011 2012 (RMB in millions) Within one year 18,171 22,640 In the second year 8,408 7,273 In the third to fifth year inclusive 9,392 7,905 After the fifth year 5,804 7,918 Total 41,775 45,736 As of December 31, 2012, our interest rates relating to short-term borrowings ranged from 1.1% to 6.6%, while our fixed interest rates on our interest-bearing borrowings for long-term bank loans ranged from 4.84% to 6.4%. Our bank loans are denominated in Renminbi, U.S. dollars and Euro. As of December 31, 2012, our total bank loans denominated in Renminbi amounted to RMB13,827 million, while our total bank loans denominated in U.S. dollars amounted to USD5,028 million. On August 11, 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary Eastern Air Overseas (Hong Kong) Corporation Limited issued offshore CNY-denominated bonds in an amount of CNY2.5 billion at 4% due 2014, listed on the SGX-ST. Our Company guaranteed the bond issue. See Note 33 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our borrowings. We have entered into credit facility agreements to meet our future working capital needs. However, our ability to obtain financing may be affected by: (i) our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and credit ratings; (ii) costs of financing in line with prevailing economic conditions and the status of the global financial markets; and (iii) our ability to obtain PRC government approvals required to access domestic or international financing or to undertake any project involving significant capital investment, which may include one or more approvals from the NDRC, SAFE, MOFCOM and/or the CSRC depending on the circumstances. If we are unable to obtain financing, for whatever reason, for a significant portion of our capital requirements, our ability to acquire new aircraft and to expand our operations may be materially and adversely affected. Capital Expenditures As of December 31, 2012, according to the relevant agreements, we expect our capital expenditures for aircraft, engines and related equipment to be in aggregate approximately RMB172,092 million, including RMB26,321 million in 2013 and RMB44,435 million in 2014, in each case subject to contractually stipulated increases or any increase relating to inflation. We plan to finance our other capital commitments through a combination of funds generated from operations, existing credit facilities, bank loans, leasing arrangements and other external financing arrangements. C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc. None. D. Trend Information Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events for the period from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012 that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that caused the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions. 37 E. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements other than our operating lease arrangements: ·We have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any unconsolidated entity; ·We have not entered into any obligations under any derivative contracts that are indexed to our own shares and classified as shareholder’s equity, or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements; and ·We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. F. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following tables set forth selected information regarding our outstanding contractual and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2012: Total Less Than 1 Year 1-2 Years 2-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-Term Debt (1) 32,856 9,760 7,273 7,905 7,918 Capital Leases (2) 21,858 2,605 2,704 7,925 8,624 Operating Leases (3) 24,580 4,074 3,682 8,313 8,511 Unconditional Purchase Obligations (4) 172,092 26,321 44,435 101,336 — Other Long-term Obligations (5)(6) 1,636 — — — — Post-retirement Benefit Obligations (5) 3,260 — — — — Deferred Tax Liabilities (5) 29 — — — — Short-term Bank Loans (7) 12,880 12,880 — — — Interest Obligations 5,239 1,450 864 1,702 1,223 Under Finance Leases 1,920 399 356 761 404 Under Bank Loans 3,319 1,051 508 941 819 Fixed Rate 349 241 108 - - Variable Rate (8) 2,970 810 400 941 819 Total 274,430 57,090 58,958 127,181 26,276 (1)Excludes interest.

(4)Primarily comprise capital expenditures. (5)Figures of payments due by period are not available. (6)Other long-term obligations include long-term duties and levies payable, and fair value of unredeemed points awarded under our Group’s frequent flyer programs. (7)Short-term bank loans are generally repayable within one year. As of December 31, 2012, the weighted average interest rate of our short-term bank loans was 5.0% per annum (2011: 4.6%). (8)For our variable rate loans, interest rates range from six month LIBOR + 0.03% to six months LIBOR + 5.3%. Interest obligations relating to variable rate loans are calculated based on the relevant LIBOR rates as of December 31, 2012. A 25 basis points increase in the interest rate would increase interest expenses by RMB123 million.

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. Revenue recognition The Group recognizes traffic revenues in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 2(e) to the financial statements. Unused tickets are recognized in traffic revenues based on current estimates. Management annually evaluates the balance in the SIAC and records any adjustments, which can be material, in the period the evaluation is completed. These adjustments result from differences between the estimates of certain revenue transactions and the timing of recognizing revenue for any unused air tickets and the related sales price, and are impacted by various factors, including a complex pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the industry, which affect the timing of revenue recognition. 38 Frequent flyer program The Group operates frequent flyer programs that provide travel awards to program members based on accumulated miles. A portion of passenger revenue attributable to the award of frequent flyer benefits is deferred and recognized when the miles have been redeemed or have expired. The deferment of revenue is estimated based on historical trends of redemptions, which is then used to project the expected utilization of these benefits and estimated fair values of the unredeemed miles. Different judgments or estimates could significantly affect the estimated provision for frequent flyer programs and the results of operations. Provision for costs of return condition checks for aircraft under operating leases Provision for the estimated costs of return condition checks for aircraft under operating leases is made based on the estimated costs for such return condition checks and taking into account anticipated flying hours, flying cycle and timeframe between each overhaul. These judgments or estimates are based on historical experience on returning similar airframe models, actual costs incurred and aircraft status. Different judgments or estimates could significantly affect the estimated provision for costs of return condition checks. Retirement benefits The Group operates and maintains defined retirement benefit plans which provide retirees with benefits including transportation subsidies, social activity subsidies as well as other welfare. The cost of providing the aforementioned benefits in the defined retirement benefit plan is actuarially determined and recognized over the employees’ service period by utilizing various actuarial assumptions and using the projected unit credit method in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 2(y) to the financial statements. These assumptions include, without limitation, the selection of discount rate, annual rate of increase of per capita benefit payment and employees’ turnover rate. The discount rate is based on management’s review of government bonds. The annual rate of increase of benefit payments is based on the general local economic conditions. The employees’ turnover rate is based on historical trends of the Group. Additional information regarding the retirement benefit plans is disclosed in Note 37 to the financial statements. Deferred income tax In assessing the amount of deferred tax assets that need to be recognized in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 2(j) to the financial statements, the Group considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event that the Group’s estimates of projected future taxable income and benefits from available tax strategies are changed, or changes in current tax regulations are enacted that would impact the timing or extent of the Group’s ability to utilize the tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards in the future, adjustments to the recorded amount of net deferred tax assets and taxation expense would be made. Provision for flight equipment spare parts Provision for flight equipment spare parts is made based on the difference between the carrying amount and the net realizable value. The net realizable value is estimated based on current market condition, historical experience and Company’s future operation plan for the aircraft and related spare parts. The net realizable value may be adjusted significantly due to the change of market condition and the future plan for the aircraft and related spare parts. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment Depreciation of components related to airframe and engine overhaul costs are based on the Group’s historical experience with similar airframe and engine models and taking into account anticipated overhauls costs, timeframe between each overhaul, ratio of actual flying hours and estimated flying hours between overhauls. Different judgments or estimates could significantly affect the estimated depreciation charge and the results of operations. Except for components related to airframe and engine overhaul costs, other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, after taking into account the estimated residual value. The useful lives are based on the Group’s historical experience with similar assets and taking into account anticipated technological changes. The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of assets regularly in order to determine the amount of depreciation expense to be recorded during any reporting period. The depreciation expense for future periods is adjusted if there are significant changes from previous estimates. Estimated impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets The Group tests whether property, plant and equipment and intangible assets have been impaired in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 2(k) and Note 2(m) to the financial statements. The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been determined based on fair value less cost to sell and value-in-use calculations. Value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management and certain key assumptions, such as passenger-kilometers yield level, load factor, aircraft utilization rate and discount rates, etc. Taxation We had carried forward tax losses of approximately RMB6,169 million as of December 31, 2012, which can be used to set off against future taxable income between 2013 and 2017. Prior to 2008, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries located in Pudong District, Shanghai, were entitled to a reduced rate of 15% pursuant to the preferential tax policy in Pudong District, Shanghai. Under China’s EIT Law, which was approved by the National People’s Congress on March 16, 2007 and became effective from January 1, 2008, the Company and its Pudong subsidiaries are entitled to a transitional arrangement to gradually increase the applicable corporate income tax rate to 25% over the next five years from 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the corporate income tax rate applicable to the Company and these subsidiaries was 25%. The net deferred tax position of the Company and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 is insignificant and the change in tax rate has no material impact on our deferred tax position. Except for those subsidiaries that are incorporated in Hong Kong and therefore subject to a Hong Kong corporate income tax rate of 16.5%, other subsidiaries of the Company are generally subject to the PRC standard income tax rate of 25%. 39 Inflation In recent years, China has been experiencing increasing levels of inflation. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, China’s overall national inflation rate, as represented by the general consumer price index, increased by approximately 3.3% in 2010, 5.4% in 2011 and in 2.6% in 2012. Although neither inflation nor deflation in the past had any material adverse impact on our results of operations, we cannot assure you that the deflation or inflation of the Chinese economy in the future would not materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

The resolutions in respect of the said connected transactions were unanimously approved by the independent directors of the Company present at the meeting, who also expressed their independent opinions. Upon the completion of the equity transfers under these connected transactions, Flight Training Company and Eastern Airlines Hotel will become wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company.

COSCO is a substantial shareholder of Shanghai Eastern Airlines Logistics Co., Ltd., which in turn is a subsidiary of the Company, and COSCO is thus a connected person of the Company. COSCO is principally engaged in the business of global passenger and cargo shipping, charter booking, voyage charter, time charter, leasing, ship building, purchase and sale of ships, container manufacturing and repairing and accessory making, warehousing, forwarding, multimodal transport and door-to-door transport, and other approved overseas futures business.

After the completion of the acquisitions, Shanghai Eastern Airlines Logistics Co., Ltd. has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

C.Interests of Experts and Counsel Not applicable. Item 8. Financial Information A.Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information Financial Statements You should read “Item 18. Financial Statements” for information regarding our audited consolidated financial statements and other financial information. Legal Proceedings We are involved in routine litigation and other proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that any of these proceedings are likely to be material to our business operations, financial condition or results of operations. In 2005, the family members of certain victims in the aircraft accident (the aircraft was then owned and operated by China Eastern Air Yunnan Company), which occurred in Baotou city in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on November 21, 2004, sued, among other defendants, our Company in a U.S. court for compensation, the amount of which has not been determined. As of December 31, 2006, we had filed a motion to contest the claim in the U.S. court because we expressly did not assume the legal liability of such incident in our acquisition of certain selected assets relating to the aviation business of CEA Yunnan. In July 2007, the Superior Court of the State of California ordered the action stayed on the grounds of forum non conveniens in order to permit proceedings in the PRC. Following the plaintiffs’ appeals, in February 2009 the Court of Appeal of California affirmed the original order. On March 16, 2009, the plaintiffs sued the Company in the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People’s Court. Legal documents including summons, prosecution notifications and related materials have been served on our Company and trial began on October 10, 2012. The management of our Group believes that any outcome for this case will not have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our Company. Save as disclosed above, we were not involved in any other new material litigation in the period of this report. Dividends and Dividend Policy For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, our Board of Directors did not recommend any dividend payouts due to our total accumulated losses of RMB18,082 million, RMB17,913 million, RMB12,956 million, RMB8,380 million and RMB5,426 million, respectively. The Directors expect the balance of accumulated losses will be carried forward to next year. Under PRC law, we cannot convert funds from the common reserve to increase our share capital during this period. Our Board declares dividends, if any, in Renminbi with respect to H Shares on a per share basis and pays such dividends in HK dollars. Any final dividend for a fiscal year is subject to shareholders’ approval. BNYM, as depositary, converts the HK dollar dividend payments and distributes them to holders of ADSs in U.S. dollars, less expenses of conversion. Under the Company Law of the PRC and our Articles of Association, all of our shareholders have equal rights to dividends and distributions. The holders of the H Shares share proportionately on a per share basis in all dividends and other distributions declared by our Board, if any, based on the foreign exchange conversion rate published by the People’s Bank of China, or PBOC, on the date of the distribution of the cash dividend. 50 We believe that our dividend policy strikes a balance between two important goals providing our shareholders with a competitive return on investment and assuring sufficient reinvestment of profits to enable us to achieve our strategic objectives. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board, which takes into account the following factors: ·our financial results; ·capital requirements; ·contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by us to our shareholders or by our subsidiaries to us; ·our shareholders interests; ·the effect on our creditworthiness; ·general business and economic conditions; and ·other factors our Board may deem relevant. Pursuant to PRC laws and regulations, dividends may only be distributed after allowance has been made for: (i) recovery of losses, if any and (ii) allocations to the statutory surplus reserve. The allocations to the statutory surplus reserve is 10% of our net profit determined in accordance with PRC Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Our distributable profits for the current fiscal year will be equal to our net profits determined in accordance with IFRS, less allocations to the statutory surplus reserve.
