Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Fluctuations in financial performance and recent losses could harm our ability to increase revenue and become profitable. We have experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our financial performance included lower levels of revenue and gross profit compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Our revenue declined approximately 20% during the year while gross profit declined from $27.2 million to $20.7 million. Factors that may cause operating results to vary and negatively impact our ability to become profitable include, but are not limited to, the shift by our customers from fiber optic to IP products, the need to transition our U.S. sales model to respond to the market shift to IP products, changing technology, new product transitions, delays in new product introductions, competition, shortages of system components, changes in the mix of products and services sold, economic factors, and timing of planned expenditures in facilities and research and development. The current economic 8 Table of Contents environment is marked by significant instability and continued economic weakness may be expected for the near future. As a result of the impact of these and other factors, we may not be able to become profitable in the near future and past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of the future performance in any particular fiscal period. We are somewhat limited in our ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls. Therefore, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected if we do not achieve increased revenues. We may not be able to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not made any adjustments to our financial statements as a result of the going concern modification to the report of our independent registered public accounting firm. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we could have to liquidate our assets, which means that we are likely to receive significantly less for those assets than the values at which such assets are carried on our financial statements Any shortfall in the proceeds from the liquidation of our assets would directly reduce the amounts, if any, that holders of our common stock could receive in liquidation. There can be no assurance that our plans will be successful, and other unforeseeable actions may become necessary. Any inability to obtain financing or raise capital may require us to reduce the level of our operations. Such actions would have a material adverse effect on us, our business, and operations and result in charges that would be material to our business and results of operations. Our current capital may not provide the funds necessary for our short and long-term cash requirements and we may not be able to secure additional funding. Our current capital resources including operating cash flows may not generate the funds needed for our short and long-term cash requirements. Accordingly, we would be required to seek additional funding. In those circumstances, we would look to increase our debt and/or pursue equity financing. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available in a timely manner or on acceptable terms. If issuing equity securities raises additional funds, further dilution to existing stockholders will result. If adequate funds are not available when needed, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate product development, sales and marketing, and overhead costs or potentially be unable to make debt payments or meet other obligations. The current economic environment has had a negative impact on our business and we may be required to restructure our operations. During 2009, our business experienced the effects of negative macroeconomic conditions, further aggravated by customer specific challenges and disruptions in the financial and credit markets globally. The affects on our business is spread across our customer segments and geographies with a particular focus in the U.S. Uncertainty around current macroeconomic and industry conditions persists, particularly the effect these conditions and a sustained lack of liquidity in the capital markets will continue to have on the capital spending of our customers. We are uncertain of the impact this may have in future periods on the spending or financial position of our customers. We can not be certain how long these conditions will continue and the magnitude of their effects on our business and results of operations. Consequently, these conditions have negatively affected our business and made our forecasting and planning more difficult. We expect the near term market conditions to be challenging and we continue to seek longer term market opportunities. During this period of uncertainty, we plan to balance our strategy of continued product development and manage our workforce and operating costs carefully to ensure that they are aligned 9 Table of Contents with our business and market opportunities. To that end, during 2009 and 2008, we effected staff reductions and we continue to explore additional organizational changes and staff reductions that will allow us to better manage our operations and reduce operating costs. These organizational changes increase the risk that objectives will not be met due to the allocation of valuable limited resources to implement changes. Further, due to the uncertain nature of any of these undertakings, these efforts may not be successful and we may not realize anticipated benefits from these efforts. We issued $23.1 million of senior and subordinated notes in connection with our acquisition of NKF. In connection with the acquisition of NKF, we issued $23.1 million of senior and subordinated notes. The issuance of these notes substantially increased our principal payment obligations and we may not have enough cash to repay the notes when due. By incurring indebtedness, the related risks that we face intensify. The degree to which we are leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully obtain financing for working capital or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures. The current economic environment is marked by limited availability of credit in the business sector and we may be required to pursue equity or other financing, if available at all, to refinance the acquisition debt on less than favorable terms. At December 31, 2009, we have an outstanding balance of $14.7 million on this debt. The senior note of $1.9 million was paid in full in March 2010 and the subordinated note is due in full on March 8, 2011. Our obligations under the promissory note issued to Draka Holding N.V. in connection with the acquisition of NKF are secured by the majority of our assets. On March 5, 2010, we entered into an amended and restated subordinated promissory note with Draka Holding N.V., pursuant to which Draka agreed to extend the term of the note to March 8, 2011. The current principal amount under the note is €9.1 million Euros ($12.5 million at the prevailing exchange rate on the transaction date). Our obligations under the note are secured by the assets of the Company and a pledge of 65% of the shares of Optelecom-NKF Holding B.V., our holding company in The Netherlands. Fair value of this 65% approximates $14.0 million at December 31, 2009. We do not expect to be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to pay the note when it becomes due. Accordingly, if we are unable to secure financing or equity to refinance the note, Draka could foreclose on its security interest and liquidate the assets securing our obligations under the note. The loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. For the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 20% of our revenues were accounted for by sales to five commercial customers. This is similar to the prior year when five customers represented 29% of our revenues. In the event of a reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from one or more significant customers or if one or more significant customers selects products from one of our competitors for inclusion in future projects, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. There can be no assurance that current customers will continue to place orders with us, that orders by existing customers will continue at current or historical levels or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers. The loss of one or more of our current significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We face significant competition for our products and any failure to remain competitive would harm our operating results. The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technologies. We face significant competition from a large number of domestic and international competitors, some of which are larger and have larger product development, research and 10 Table of Contents sales staffs. To remain competitive in both the current and future business climates, we believe we must maintain a substantial commitment to research and development. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing such products or producing enhancements that meet these changing demands, or that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these products or that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our inability to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner or our failure to achieve market acceptance of new products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results and our efforts to remain competitive. Our management structure is globally integrated. Our corporate structure globally integrates the management functions into one group to address the continually changing technology trends within the industry. The Company was previously established as individually and separately-managed units at our U.S. global headquarters and European operating facilities. Global integration includes product development, manufacturing, sales processes, finance and information technology. The challenges involved in this structure include the following: Coordinating manufacturing operations in a rapid and efficient manner; Combining product offerings and product lines effectively and quickly; Integrating sales efforts so that customers can do business easily with the combined company; Bringing together the companies' marketing efforts so that the industry receives useful information about our products and services; Coordinating research and development activities to enhance introduction of new products and technologies; and Ensuring employee compatibility in diverse global offices and markets. If we fail to attract and retain key personnel, our business could suffer. Our future depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. We may not be able to hire and retain personnel at levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Our future also depends on the continued contributions of our executive management team and other key management, and technical personnel, many of whom could be difficult to replace. The loss of service from these or other executive officers or key personnel or the inability to attract qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our common stock price is volatile, we have never paid dividends and our stock is subject to future dilution. Our Common Stock currently trades on the NASDAQ Global Market. The securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that were unrelated to our operating performance. In addition, the market prices of the common stock of many publicly traded technology companies have in the past been, and may in the future be, especially volatile. Announcements of technological innovations or new products of the Company or our competitors, developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights, publicity regarding products under development by the Company or our competitors, regulatory developments in both the United States and foreign countries, and economic and other external factors, as well as period-to-period fluctuations in our 11 Table of Contents operating and product development results, may have a significant impact on the market price of our Common Stock. We have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, dilution will occur upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or issuance of additional stock. Further dilution could be significant if we experience additional requirements to fund operations and decide to complete a future equity financing. We face a number of risks related to the ongoing financial crisis and severe tightening in the global credit markets. The ongoing global financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets has resulted in a severe tightening in the worldwide credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in credit and equity markets. This financial crisis could impact the Company's business in a number of ways, as further discussed above and including: Potential Deferment or Cancellation of Purchases and Orders by Customers: Uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions may cause businesses and governments to defer or cancel purchases in response to tighter credit, decreased cash availability and declining consumer confidence. If future demand for our products declines, it will adversely impact our financial results. Customers' Inability to Obtain Financing to Make Purchases from the Company and/or Maintain Their Business: Some of our customers require substantial financing in order to fund their operations and make purchases from the Company. The inability of these customers to obtain sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products and/or meet their payment obligations to us could have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, if the financial crisis results in insolvencies for our customers, it will adversely impact our financial results. We face risks related to our international operations and revenue. Our customers are located throughout the world. In addition, with the acquisition of NKF, we have significant international operations including manufacturing, product development, sales and customer support operations. Our operations outside North America are primarily located in the Netherlands. Our international presence exposes us to certain risks, including the following: currency fluctuations; our ability to comply with customs, import/export and other trade compliance regulations of the countries in which we do business, together with any unexpected changes in such regulations; difficulties in establishing and enforcing our intellectual property rights; tariffs and other trade barriers; political, legal and economic instability in foreign markets; difficulties in staffing and management; language and cultural barriers; seasonal reductions in business activities in the countries where our international customers are located; integration of foreign operations; longer payment cycles; greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection; and 12 Table of Contents potential adverse tax consequences. Net revenue from International and U.S. based business accounted for 72% and 28%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue in 2009. Within the U.S. based business sales to customers in Canada, South and Central America were 12% in 2009. We expect that revenue from customers outside the United States will continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue. If we fail to manage our exposure to worldwide financial markets successfully, our operating results could suffer. We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. A portion of our net revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, our European operations conduct a substantial portion of their activities in other currencies, primarily Euros. A significant change in interest rates or movement in the Euro compared to the U.S. Dollar impacts our operations and financial position. If we are unable to generate new sales and return to profitability, our business and our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely impacted. Our lack of profitability in certain periods may impact our ability to attract customers, employees, investors and creditors. Our ability to sustain profitability in future periods will depend in large part on our ability to maintain current customers and generate new sales, to maintain or improve our rate of manufacturing utilization, and to manage sales, product development, and general and administrative expenses in proportion to our revenue. We cannot be certain that we will generate profits in the future and a failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to operate. Our profitability and cash flow constraints are particularly emphasized in our U.S. operations where our recent sales levels underscore the need to succeed with the implementation of product advancements and sales improvements and maintain cost controls.
