Risk FactorsRisks Related to TaxationCanada". Special rules, which are not discussed in this summary, may apply to a Non-Canadian Holder that is an insurer carrying on business in Canada and elsewhere. Taxation of Income or Loss A Non-Canadian Holder will not be subject to Canadian federal income tax under Part I of the Tax Act on its share of income from a business carried on by our partnership (or the Holding LP) outside Canada or the non-business income earned by our partnership (or the Holding LP) from sources in Canada. However, a Non-Canadian Holder may be subject to Canadian federal withholding tax under Part XIII of the Tax Act, as described below. Our Managing General Partner intends to organize and conduct the affairs of our partnership and the Holding LP, to the extent possible, such that Non-Canadian Holders should not be considered to be carrying on business in Canada solely by virtue of holding our units. However, no assurance can be given in this regard. Our partnership and the Holding LP will be deemed to be a non-resident person in respect of certain amounts paid or credited or deemed to be paid or credited to them by a person resident or deemed to be resident in Canada, including dividends or interest. Dividends or interest (other than interest exempt from Canadian federal withholding tax) paid or deemed to be paid by a person resident or deemed to be resident in Canada to the Holding LP will be subject to withholding tax under Part XIII of the Tax Act at the rate of 25%. However, the CRA's administrative practice in similar circumstances is to permit the rate of Canadian federal withholding tax applicable to such payments to be computed by looking through the partnership and taking into account the residency of the partners (including partners who are resident in Canada) and any reduced rates of Canadian federal withholding tax that any non-resident partners may be entitled to under an applicable income tax treaty or convention, provided that the residency status and entitlement to the treaty benefits can be established. In determining the rate of Canadian federal withholding tax applicable to amounts paid by the Holding Entities to the Holding LP, our Managing General Partner expects the Holding Entities to look-through the Holding LP and our partnership to the residency of the partners of our partnership (including partners who are resident in Canada) and to take into account any reduced rates of Canadian federal withholding tax that non-resident partners may be entitled to under an applicable income tax treaty or convention in order to determine the appropriate amount of Canadian federal withholding tax to withhold from dividends or interest paid to the Holding LP. However, there can be no assurance that the CRA would apply its administrative practice in this context. Under the Treaty, in certain circumstances a Canadian-resident payer is required to look-through fiscally transparent partnerships 172 Brookfield Infrastructure such as our partnership and the Holding LP to the residency and Treaty entitlements of their partners and take into account the reduced rates of Canadian federal withholding tax that such partners may be entitled to under the Treaty. AUSTRALIAN TAX CONSIDERATIONS Set out below are general Australian income tax implications for Australian tax resident holders of units (Australian Holders). This is not tax advice an Australian Holder can rely on. The individual circumstances of each Australian Holder will affect the taxation implications of each Australian Holder's interest in our partnership. Australian Holders should seek appropriate independent professional advice that considers the taxation implications in respect of their own specific circumstances. The discussion is primarily intended for Australian Holders who hold their interest in our partnership on capital account. Different outcomes will potentially arise for Australian Holders who are investing on revenue account. Those Australian Holders should seek professional taxation advice in relation to their interest in our partnership. The summary of the Australian income tax implications set out below is based on established judicial and administrative interpretations of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) ("ITAA 1997"), the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ("ITAA 1936") and the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ("Administration Act") as at the date of this annual report. Summary The key Australian income tax implications for Australian Holders of units are set out below: Our partnership should be classified as a "corporate limited partnership" for Australian income tax purposes as: it satisfies the definition of "corporate limited partnership"; and it is not either a "venture capital limited partnership", an "early stage venture capital limited partnership", an "Australian venture capital fund of funds" or a "venture capital management partnership"; and it is not a "foreign hybrid limited partnership". On the basis that our partnership is a corporate limited partnership it should be treated as a company for Australian tax purposes. Our partnership is a non-resident of Australia for tax purposes and therefore, should not be subject to income tax in Australia except for any income sourced in Australia, or in respect of certain capital gains that relate to "taxable Australian property" as detailed in the ITAA 1997. Distributions made by our partnership to Australian Holders should be characterized as dividends for Australian income tax purposes and included in Australian Holders' assessable unfranked dividend income. Australian Holders should not be subject to income tax on an accruals basis under the Controlled Foreign Company ("CFC") or proposed Foreign Accumulation Fund ("FAF") rules. This conclusion is dependent on the quantum and nature of the interests held in our partnership. The disposal of units by Australian Holders should give rise to a capital gains tax ("CGT") event for the Australian Holders. Broadly, Australian Holders that hold their units on capital account should realize a capital gain (or loss) equal to the difference between any capital proceeds received and the cost base (or reduced cost base) of the units. Brookfield Infrastructure 173 Characterization of the Partnership Definition of "limited partnership" A limited partnership is defined in section 995-1 of the ITAA 1997 and means: a.an association of persons (other than a company) carrying on business as partners or in receipt of ordinary income or statutory income jointly, where the liability of at least one of those persons is limited; or b.an association of persons (other than one referred to in paragraph (a)) with legal personality separate from those persons that was formed solely for the purpose of becoming a "venture capital limited partnership" ("VCLP"), an "early stage venture capital limited partnership" ("ESVCLP"), an "Australian venture capital fund of funds" ("AFOF") or a "venture capital management partnership" ("VCMP") and to carry on activities that are carried on by a body of that kind. There is no requirement as to where or under which law the liability is limited. For tax purposes, the liability is limited if it is effectively limited under the laws applying to the partnership (as per the partnership agreement). Our partnership should be a limited partnership for Australian tax purposes. Definition of "corporate limited partnership" Under subsection 94D(1)(a) of the ITAA 1936, a partnership will be a corporate limited partnership in relation to the year of income of the partnership if the year of income is the 1995-96 year of income or a later year of income. Our partnership should be a corporate limited partnership under subsection 94D(1) of the above definition. Subsection 94D(2) of the ITAA 1936 specifically excludes from a corporate limited partnership a VCLP, ESVCLP, or AFOF. A requirement for each of these definitions is that the partnership be registered either in Australia or a country prescribed by relevant regulations or be an Australian resident. Our partnership is registered in Bermuda and is not a resident of Australia. Bermuda is not a country prescribed by relevant regulations. Therefore our partnership will not be a VCLP, ESVCLP or AFOF. A VCLP is defined by reference to the Venture Capital Act 2002. Our partnership, as a Bermudian Exempted Limited Partnership, will not be excluded from the definition of a corporate limited partnership as subsection 9-1(1) of the Venture Capital Act requires of a VCLP that: (a)the partnership was established by or under a law in force in, or in any part of: I.Australia; or II.a foreign country in respect of which a double tax agreement (as defined in Part X of the ITAA 1936) is in force; and (b)all of the partners who are general partners are residents of a country referred to in paragraph (a). Definition of "foreign hybrid limited partnership" Pursuant to sub-section 94D(5) of the ITAA 1936, an exception to our partnership being a corporate limited partnership applies if it is a "foreign hybrid limited partnership" ("FHLP"), as defined in section 830-10 of the ITAA 1997. A limited partnership will be a FHLP if: a.it was formed in a foreign country (i.e. other than Australia); and 174 Brookfield Infrastructure b.foreign income tax is imposed under the law of the foreign country on the partners, not the limited partnership, in respect of the income or profits of the partnership for the income year; and c.at no time during the income year is the limited partnership, for the purposes of a law of any foreign country that imposes foreign income tax on entities because they are residents of the foreign country, a resident of that country; and d.disregarding subsection 94D(5) of the ITAA 1936, at no time during the income year is it an Australian resident; and e.disregarding that subsection, in relation to the same income year of another taxpayer: I.the limited partnership is a CFC at the end of a statutory accounting period that ends in the income year; and II.at the end of the statutory accounting period, the taxpayer is an attributable taxpayer in relation to the CFC with an attribution percentage greater than nil. Paragraph (a) should be met on the basis that our partnership was formed in Bermuda. Paragraph (b) would not be met on the basis that Bermuda does not impose any tax on income, profits, dividends or wealth. Therefore, there is no foreign tax imposed under the laws of Bermuda on the partners of our partnership and this paragraph will not be satisfied. This position is confirmed by the Australia Taxation Office ("ATO") in ATO ID 2006/149. On the basis that paragraph (b) is not met, our partnership should not be a FHLP. Conclusion Our partnership should be classified as a corporate limited partnership for Australian income tax purposes in accordance with section 94D of the ITAA 1997. The consequences of that include that our partnership is treated as a company for the purposes of applying Australian domestic income tax law (sections 94J and 94K of the ITAA 1936). Accordingly, Australian Holders' units in our partnership should be treated as shares in a company. Proposed Foreign Accumulation Fund rules Broadly, the proposed FAF rules, if enacted, should apply to an Australian resident who has an interest in a FAF, providing a tax deferral benefit for the income year. A FAF is a foreign resident that is not a CFC, whose investment returns are subject to a low level of risk and which does not distribute substantially all of the profits and gains of the fund. The level of risk of return of an investment held by an entity will be low if the return is 'sufficiently certain'. A return is sufficiently certain, where at the time the investment is made it is reasonably expected that the foreign entity will receive returns from the investments it makes and at least some of the return is fixed or determinable with reasonable accuracy. Returns on an investment in our partnership will not be fixed or accurately determinable as the distributions are at the discretion of our Managing General Partner. Our Managing General Partner is not required to make distributions and provides no assurance that distributions will be made as intended. The distributions paid by our partnership will be dependent on the performance of its investments. Accordingly, the proposed FAF rules should not apply to the income accruing to Australian Holders in our partnership. Brookfield Infrastructure 175 Partnership distributions to Australian Holders Australian Holders will potentially receive distributions from our partnership. Distributions will be treated as dividends on the basis that our partnership is a corporate limited partnership for Australian tax purposes. The distributions should be treated as unfranked dividends to Australian Holders. Our partnership will not provide information to enable Australian Holders to determine whether a return of capital has been made for Australian tax purposes. Therefore, Australian Holders should treat all distributions as unfranked dividends. The taxation treatment of a partnership dividend received by Australian Holders will vary depending on the type of Australian Holder. Australian Holders should seek further independent advice in relation to the nature of future distributions received from our partnership. Set out below is a summary of how different types of Australian Holders should treat a distribution received from our partnership. Australian tax resident individuals Distributions received by Australian tax resident individuals should in most cases be included in their Australian assessable income. Australian Holders should be entitled to an Australian foreign income tax offset which reduces the Australian tax payable on assessable dividends by the amount of any foreign income tax withheld by our partnership. Australian Holders should seek independent advice in relation to their entitlement to Australian foreign income tax offsets to the extent foreign tax is withheld. Australian tax resident companies The taxation treatment of a dividend received by an Australian tax resident company is the same as that described above for an Australian tax resident individual. Australian tax resident trusts The comments below relate to Australian tax resident beneficiaries who are not under a legal disability where those beneficiaries are presently entitled to income of an Australian resident trust. If the beneficiary is under a legal disability, we recommend those beneficiaries seek independent professional taxation advice. Distributions in the form of dividend income should either be included in the trustee's, or the beneficiary's, assessable income, as the case may be. The tax treatment of the dividend then depends on the tax status of the Australian resident trust and the legal identity of the beneficiary as an individual, a company or a trust (refer to comments above). Australian tax resident superannuation funds Dividends paid to an Australian tax resident superannuation fund should be included in the fund's Australian assessable income. Superannuation funds should be entitled to an Australian foreign income tax offset against the Australian tax payable on assessable dividends for any foreign income tax withheld by our partnership on future distributions. Australian Holders should seek further independent advice in relation to their entitlement to Australian foreign income tax offsets to the extent foreign tax is withheld on our partnership distributions. 176 Brookfield Infrastructure Documentation for Australian Holders Australian Holders with income tax years that end on 30 June will not receive any documentation from our partnership that will correlate directly to a 30 June income tax year end. Australian Holders will need to rely on distribution payment statements to support their Australian income tax disclosures. Australian CGT implications for Australian Holders Cost base of the Partnership Units The cost base of the units for Australian Holders who bought their units in our partnership directly should equal the money paid for those units plus any incidental costs of acquisition and disposal of the units (e.g. broker's fees, borrowing expenses). Where an Australian Holder received the units as consideration for entering into the Merger Transaction, the cost base or reduced cost base of the units acquired is made up of a number of elements including the money paid or market value of property given to acquire the units. That amount should be the market value of the Prime Infrastructure securities exchanged for the units under the Merger Transaction plus the incidental costs of acquisition and disposal of the Prime Infrastructure securities (if any). On the basis that our partnership and the Prime Infrastructure securityholders were acting at arm's length, the market value of the Prime Infrastructure securities disposed of under the Merger Transaction should be the same as the market value of the units received in exchange. The acquisition date for the units for CGT purposes should be the date the units were allotted to the Prime Infrastructure securityholders (8 December 2010 Australian Eastern Standard Time). The market value of the units may be determined by reference to the NYSE/TSX VWAP of these units on 8 December 2010 (A$20.651 per unit). Disposal of units In the event Australian Holders dispose of units, a capital gain should arise where the sale proceeds received exceed an Australian Holders' cost base in the units. A capital loss should arise where the Australian Holders' reduced cost base exceeds the sale proceeds. The time that the CGT event occurs is when the contract is entered into or, if there is no contract, when the change of ownership occurs. Partnership distributions should be treated as unfranked dividends and no CGT cost base reduction should be calculated as a result of the distributions. Where the proceeds received are in foreign currency (e.g. US$ or C$), these should be converted into A$ at the daily average exchange rate for the day of the sale (the date the sale contract is entered into). The ATO publish daily average exchange rates on their website (www.ato.gov.au). This may be a different amount than the A$ cash an Australian Holder ultimately receives. Accordingly, there may a foreign exchange gain or loss if there are any fluctuations in the exchange rate between the date of the sale contract and the date payment is received by the Australian Holders. To the extent payment is received within 12 months of the date of disposal (the date the sale contract is entered into) of the units any such foreign exchange realization gains or losses will be capital in nature and subject to the CGT provisions (i.e. included in the overall gain or loss on the disposal of the units). If payment is received more than 12 months after the contract date, the foreign exchange gain or loss provisions of the ITAA 1997 apply. Australian Holders should seek specific advice in this circumstance. Brookfield Infrastructure 177 Discount of capital gain Provided the units that gave rise to the capital gain were held for at least 12 months prior to the occurrence of the CGT event, any net capital gain realized by an Australian Holder on those units (e.g. if a sale were to occur) may qualify for discount capital gains tax treatment. The discount is taken into account after applying any available capital losses against the capital gain eligible for the discount. This treatment broadly only applies in respect of units held by Australian Holders that are individuals, trustees of trusts, and trustees of superannuation funds. No such discount is available for corporate Australian Holders. Where the CGT discount is available, individual Australian Holders (either holding their units directly or indirectly through a trust) may reduce their net capital gain by 50%. For trustees (responsible entities) of superannuation funds, the net capital gain may be reduced by 331/3%. BERMUDA TAX CONSIDERATIONS In Bermuda there are no taxes on profits, income or dividends, nor is there any capital gains tax, estate duty or death duty. Profits can be accumulated and it is not obligatory to pay dividends. As "exempted undertakings", exempted partnerships and overseas partnerships are entitled to apply for (and will ordinarily receive) an assurance pursuant to the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 that, in the event that legislation introducing taxes computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, is enacted, such taxes shall not be applicable to the partnership or any of its operations until March 31, 2035. Such an assurance may include the assurance that any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall not be applicable to the units, debentures or other obligations of the partnership. Exempted partnerships and overseas partnerships fall within the definition of "international businesses" for the purposes of the Stamp Duties (International Businesses Relief) Act 1990, which means that instruments executed by or in relation to an exempted partnership or an overseas partnership are exempt from stamp duties (such duties were formerly applicable under the Stamp Duties Act 1976). Thus, stamp duties are not payable upon, for example, an instrument which effects the transfer or assignment of a unit in an exempted partnership or an overseas partnership, or the sale or mortgage of partnership assets; nor are they payable upon the partnership capital. 10.F DIVIDENDS AND PAYING AGENTS Not applicable. 10.G STATEMENT BY EXPERTS Not applicable. 10.H DOCUMENTS ON DISPLAY Any statement in this annual report on Form 20-F about any of our contracts or other documents is not necessarily complete.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December 31, 2013, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of persons performing the functions of principal executive and principal financial officers for us and the Service Provider. Based upon that evaluation, the persons performing the functions of principal executive and principal financial officers for us have concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective: (i) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms; and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the persons performing the functions of principal executive and principal financial officers for us, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that while our management, including persons performing the functions of principal executive and principal financial officers for us, believe our disclosure controls and procedures provide a reasonable level of assurance that such controls and procedures are effective, they do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including persons performing the functions of principal executive and principal financial officers for us, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on evaluation under the Framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013. Excluded from our evaluation were controls over financial reporting at our U.S. district energy operation, in which control was acquired on December 2, 2013. The financial statements of this entity constitute less than 1% of both net and total assets, and less than 1% of both revenues and net income of the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013. Internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 180 Brookfield Infrastructure Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by Deloitte LLP, Chartered Professional Accountants, Chartered Accountants, who have also audited the financial statements of our partnership, as stated in their reports which are included herein. Changes in Internal Control There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2013, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 16A. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERTS Our Managing General Partner's board of directors has determined that Danesh Varma possesses specific accounting and financial management expertise, that he is the audit committee financial expert as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and that he is independent within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE. The board of directors of our Managing General Partner has also determined that other members of the audit committee have sufficient experience and ability in finance and compliance matters to enable them to adequately discharge their responsibilities. ITEM 16B. CODE OF ETHICS On December 4, 2007, our Managing General Partner adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics ("Code") that applies to the members of the board of directors of our Managing General Partner, our partnership and any officers or employees of our Managing General Partner. The Code was updated in 2013 and we have posted a copy of the current Code on our website at www.brookfieldinfrastructure.com/aboutus/governance. ITEM 16C. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES Our Managing General Partner has retained Deloitte LLP to act as our partnership's independent registered public accountants. The table below summarizes the fees for professional services rendered by Deloitte LLP: For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 FEES USD ('000) % USD ('000) % Audit fees(1) $ 4,574 95% $ 4,035 94% Tax fees   15  Audit-related fees(2) 266 5% 264 6% Total $ 4,840 100% $ 4,314 100% (1)Audit fees relate to annual fees for our partnership and the Holding LP.(2)Audit-related fees relate primarily to services pertaining to the filing of our base shelf prospectus, Form F-3 and other securities-related matters.

EXEMPTIONS FROM THE LISTING STANDARDS FOR AUDIT COMMITTEE None. Brookfield Infrastructure 181 ITEM 16E. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE ISSUER AND AFFILIATED PURCHASER Our partnership may from time-to-time, subject to applicable law, purchase our units for cancellation in the open market, provided that any necessary approval has been obtained. Brookfield has also advised our partnership that it may from time-to-time, subject to applicable law, purchase our units in the market without making an offer to all unitholders. On October 1, 2013, our partnership announced that the TSX accepted a notice filed by our partnership of its intention to renew its normal course issuer bid. Our partnership believes that at times our units may trade in a price range that does not fully reflect their value. As a result, from time to time, acquiring our units for cancellation represents an attractive use of available funds. Under the normal course issuer bid, the board of directors of our Managing General Partner authorized our partnership to repurchase up to the equivalent of $40 million of our units. Under the rules of the TSX, our partnership may purchase an aggregate of up to 1,051,863 units. Under the normal course issuer bid, our partnership may purchase up to 29,359 units on the TSX during any trading day. The price to be paid for our units under the normal course issuer bid will be the market price at the time of purchase. The actual number of units to be purchased and the timing of such purchases will be determined by our partnership, and all purchases will be made through the facilities of the TSX or the NYSE. Repurchases were authorized to commence on October 4, 2013 and will terminate on October 3, 2014 or earlier should our partnership complete its repurchases prior to such date. Repurchases shall occur subject to prevailing market conditions and will be funded from available cash. Repurchases will also be subject to compliance with applicable United States federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, as well as applicable Canadian securities laws. All of our units acquired by our partnership under the normal course issuer bid will be cancelled. In the year ended December 31, 2013, none of our units were repurchased and cancelled under the normal course issuer bid. ITEM 16F. CHANGE IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT Not Applicable. ITEM 16G. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Our corporate governance practices are not materially different from those required of domestic limited partnerships under the NYSE listing standards. ITEM 16H. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose in their periodic reports filed with the SEC information regarding specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities under the regulation of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA") under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended ("Mine Act"). During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, our partnership did not have any mines in the United States subject to regulation by MSHA under the Mine Act. 182 Brookfield Infrastructure PART III ITEM 17.

Management's Responsibility for Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and its financial performance and their cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Other Matter We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992) F-2 Brookfield Infrastructure issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 28, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Deloitte LLP Toronto, Canada March 28, 2014 Chartered Professional Accountants, Chartered Accountants Licensed Public Accountants Brookfield Infrastructure F-3 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Partners of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. Dear Sirs/Mesdames: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Partnership") as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at its U.S. district energy operation, in which control was acquired on December 2, 2013. The financial statements of this entity constitute less than 1% of both net and total assets and less than 1% of both revenues and net income of the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at the U.S. district energy operation. The Partnership's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. F-4 Brookfield Infrastructure In our opinion, the Partnership maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 of the Partnership and our report dated March 28, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. /s/ Deloitte LLP Toronto, Canada March 28, 2014 Chartered Professional Accountants, Chartered Accountants Licensed Public Accountants Brookfield Infrastructure F-5 BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P.

Bermuda 72 72 100 100 (1)In November 2012, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Infrastructure entered into an arrangement whereby a 20% economic interest in its UK regulated distribution operation was granted to an institutional investor for £145 million subject to the UK regulated distribution operation attaining long-term financing under certain pre-defined contractual terms. In the event that the UK regulated distribution operation did not obtain long-term financing at the contractually specified terms within two years of the arrangement, the institutional investor had the right to request repayment of £145 million plus 3% interest. Consequently, the proceeds were recorded as a financial liability. In March 2013, the UK regulated distribution operation satisfied the requirements within the contractual terms of the arrangement, which resulted in the derecognition of the financial liability as the £145 million initially received under the arrangement was recognized as proceeds on the disposal of a partial interest of a subsidiary (see note 5 for further details). (2)In December 2013, Brookfield Infrastructure acquired a 40% interest in Enwave USA through a Brookfield sponsored infrastructure fund for $43 million. (3)Brookfield Infrastructure sold its 30% interest in its U.S. freehold timberlands to a third party for proceeds of $467 million. This transaction closed in the third quarter of 2013. See Note 6 for further details. (4)During the second quarter of 2013, Brookfield Infrastructure disposed of its 25% interest in its Canadian freehold timberlands to a third party for proceeds of $173 million. See Note 6 for further details. (5)For the above noted subsidiaries, the partnership has entered into voting arrangements to provide the partnership with the ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee. The partnership controls these investees given that the partnership is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The partnership exercises judgment to determine the level of variability that will achieve control over an investee, particularly in circumstances where the partnership's voting interest differs from its ownership interest in an investee. The following were considered to determine control: the degree of power (if any) held by other investors, the determination of whether any general partner removal rights are substantive and the purpose and design of the investee.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 NOTE 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a)Statement of Compliance These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"). The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on March 28, 2014. (b)Basis of Preparation The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. Standards and guidelines not yet effective for the current accounting period are described in note 3(t). (i)Subsidiaries These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the partnership and subsidiaries over which the partnership has control. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the partnership obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when control is lost. The partnership (investor) controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The partnership controls an investee when all the following have been satisfied: it has power over the investee, exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns. Together, the partnership and its subsidiaries are referred to as "Brookfield Infrastructure" in these financial statements. Non-controlling interests may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in partnership capital in addition to changes in ownership interests. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Holding LP has issued Redeemable Partnership Units held by Brookfield, which may, at the request of the holder, require the Holding LP to redeem the units for cash consideration equal to the market price of the partnership's limited partnership units. This right is subject to the partnership's right of first refusal which entitled it, at its sole discretion, to elect to acquire any unit so presented to Holding LP in exchange for one of the partnership's units (subject to certain customary adjustments). All intercompany balances, transactions, revenues and expenses are eliminated in full. (ii)Associates Associates are entities over which the partnership has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not constitute control. The partnership accounts for investments over which it has significant influence Brookfield Infrastructure F-13 BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 using the equity method, and are recorded as Investments in associates on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Interests in investments accounted for using the equity method are initially recorded at cost. If the cost of the associate is lower than the proportionate share of the investment's underlying fair value, the partnership records a gain on the difference between the cost and the underlying fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate. If the cost of the associate is greater than the partnership's proportionate share of the underlying fair value, goodwill and other adjustments arising from the purchase price allocation relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Subsequent to initial recognition, the carrying value of the partnership's interest in an investee is adjusted for the partnership's share of comprehensive income or loss and distributions to the investee. Profits or losses resulting from transactions with an associate are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the interest of unrelated investors in the associate. (c)Foreign Currency Translation The U.S dollar is the functional and presentation currency of Brookfield Infrastructure. Each of Brookfield Infrastructure's subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each subsidiary and associate are measured using that functional currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations having a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and revenues and expenses at average rates during the period. Gains or losses on translation are included as a component of equity. On disposal of a foreign operation resulting in the loss of control, the component of other comprehensive income due to accumulated foreign currency translation relating to that foreign operation is reclassified to net income. Gains or losses on foreign currency denominated balances and transactions that are designated as hedges of net investments in these operations are reported in the same manner. On partial disposal of a foreign operation in which control is retained, the proportionate share of the component of other comprehensive income or loss relating to that foreign operation is reclassified to non-controlling interests in that foreign operation. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Revenues and expenses are measured at average rates during the period. Gains or losses on translation of these items are included in net income. Gains and losses on transactions which hedge these items are also included in net income or loss. Foreign currency denominated non-monetary assets and liabilities, measured at historic cost, are translated at the rate of exchange at the transaction date. (d)Business Combinations Business acquisitions in which control is acquired are accounted for using the acquisition method, other than those between and among entities under common control. The consideration of each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the acquisition date) of assets transferred by the acquirer, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by Brookfield Infrastructure in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operating Results as incurred and included in other expenses. F-14 Brookfield Infrastructure BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in fair values are adjusted against the cost of the acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as liabilities will be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operating Results, whereas changes in the fair values of contingent consideration classified within partnership capital are not subsequently re-measured. Where a business combination is achieved in stages, Brookfield Infrastructure's previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date, that is, the date Brookfield Infrastructure attains control and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operating Results. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operating Results, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of. If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, Brookfield Infrastructure reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognized, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized as of that date. The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date Brookfield Infrastructure obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The measurement period is subject to a maximum of one year subsequent to the acquisition date. If, after reassessment, Brookfield Infrastructure's interest in the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized immediately in income or loss as a bargain purchase gain. Contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination are initially measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. At the end of subsequent reporting periods, such contingent liabilities are measured at the higher of the amount that would be recognized in accordance with IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets ("IAS 37") and the amount initially recognized less cumulative amortization recognized in accordance with IAS 18, Revenue Recognition ("IAS 18"). (e)Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. (f)Accounts Receivable Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any allowance for uncollectability.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (g)Property, Plant and Equipment Brookfield Infrastructure uses the revaluation method of accounting for all classes of property, plant and equipment. Certain assets which are under development for future use as property, plant and equipment are also accounted for using the revaluation method. Property, plant and equipment is initially measured at cost and subsequently carried at its revalued amount, being the fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Revaluations are made on an annual basis or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ significantly from fair value. Where the carrying amount of an asset is increased as a result of a revaluation, the increase is recognized in other comprehensive income or loss and accumulated in equity within the revaluation surplus reserve, unless the increase reverses a previously recognized impairment recorded through net income, in which case that portion of the increase is recognized in net income. Where the carrying amount of an asset is decreased, the decrease is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent of any balance existing in revaluation surplus in respect of the asset, with the remainder of the decrease recognized in net income. Revaluation gains are included in other comprehensive income, but are not subsequently recycled into profit or loss. An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognized is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising on disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operating Results. However, any balance accumulated in revaluation surplus is subsequently recorded in retained earnings when an asset is derecognized and not transferred to profit or loss. Depreciation of an asset commences when it is available for use. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of the assets as follows: Buildings Up to 50 years Transmission stations, towers and related fixtures Up to 40 years Leasehold improvements Up to 49 years Plant and equipment Up to 39 years Network systems Up to 40 years Track premium 41 years District energy system 50 years Gas storage assets 20 years Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write-off the net cost of each asset over its expected useful life to its estimated residual value. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease or estimated useful life, whichever is the shorter, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period, with the effect of any changes recognized on a prospective basis. F-16 Brookfield Infrastructure BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (h)Standing Timber Standing timber is measured at fair value after deducting estimated selling costs and recorded as standing timber on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Estimated selling costs include commissions, levies, delivery costs, transfer taxes and duties. The fair value of standing timber is calculated as the present value of anticipated future cash flows for standing timber before tax. The calculation is based on existing, sustainable felling plans and assessments regarding growth, timber prices and felling and silviculture costs. The discount rate is based upon a market participant's optimal weighted average cost of capital before tax for the geographic location of the standing timber. Changes in fair value are recorded in net income during the period of change. Brookfield Infrastructure determines fair value on an annual basis, fair value is estimated and determined by management of the Partnership with due consideration given to other relevant data points. Land under standing timber is accounted for using the revaluation method and included in property, plant and equipment. Harvested timber is included in inventory and is measured at the lower of fair value less estimated costs to sell at the time of harvest and net realizable values. (i)Investment Property Brookfield Infrastructure uses the fair value method to account for real estate classified as investment property. A property is determined to be an investment property when it is principally held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation, or both. Investment property is initially measured at cost including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are carried at fair value. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are included in profit or loss. Land of Brookfield Infrastructure's U.S. and Canadian freehold timberlands, which has been determined to have a highest and best use as defined in IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement, and which is no longer used for the harvest and growth of timber is classified as investment property. Fair values are primarily determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of each property, generally over a term of 10 years, using a discount and terminal capitalization rate reflective of the characteristics, location and market of each property. The future cash flows of each property are based upon, among other things, rental income from current leases and assumptions about rental income from future leases reflecting current conditions, less future cash outflows in respect of such current and future leases. Fair value is estimated by management of the Partnership with due consideration given to other relevant data points. (j)Asset Impairment At each reporting date Brookfield Infrastructure assesses whether for assets, other than those measured at fair value with changes in values recorded in net income, there is any indication that such assets are impaired. This assessment includes a review of internal and external factors which includes, but is not limited to, changes in the technological, political, economic or legal environment in which the entity operates in, structural changes in the industry, changes in the level of demand, physical damage and obsolescence due to technological changes. An impairment is recognized if the recoverable amount, determined as the higher of the estimated fair value less costs of disposal or the discounted future cash flows generated from use and eventual disposal from an asset or cash generating unit is less than their carrying value. The projections of future cash flows take into account the relevant operating plans and Brookfield Infrastructure F-17 BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 management's best estimate of the most probable set of conditions anticipated to prevail. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is increased to the lesser of the revised estimate of recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been recorded had no impairment loss been recognized previously. (k)Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognized separately from goodwill are initially recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date. Brookfield Infrastructure's intangible assets are comprised primarily of conservancy rights, service concession arrangements and customer order backlogs. Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortization (unless indefinite lived) and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately. Public service concessions that provide Brookfield Infrastructure the right to charge users for a service in which the service and fee is regulated by the grantor are accounted for as an intangible asset under IFRIC 12, Service Concession Arrangements. Concession arrangements were acquired as part of the acquisition of the Australian regulated terminal operation and Chilean toll roads and were recognized at their fair values. The intangible asset at the Australian regulated terminal operation relates to use of a specific coal port terminal for a contractual length of time and is amortized over the life of the contractual arrangement (90 years remaining). The intangible assets at the Chilean toll road relates to the right to operate a road and charge users a specified tariff for a contractual length of time and is amortized over the life of the contractual arrangement (20 years remaining). The conservancy right was acquired as part of the acquisition of the U.K. port operation and was recorded at its fair value. As a right in perpetuity issued by the Statutory Harbour Authority in the U.K., the conservancy right is classified as having an indefinite life and is subject to an annual impairment review. The customer order backlog was acquired as part of the acquisition of the U.K. regulated distribution operation and was recorded at its fair value. The customer order backlog represents the present value of future earnings derived from the build out of contracted connections as at the acquisition date of the U.K. regulated distribution operation. The customer order backlog is amortized over the life of its estimated useful life of 50 years. Intangible assets acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization of the Australian regulated terminal operation concession arrangement and U.K. regulated distribution customer order backlog intangible assets are recognized on a straight-line basis over the intangible assets' estimated useful lives. Amortization of the Chilean toll road reflects the pattern of consumption of the intangible asset over the estimated useful life of the concession arrangement. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. F-18 Brookfield Infrastructure BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized. (l)Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the price paid for the acquisition of an entity over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit or units to which it relates. Brookfield Infrastructure identifies cash generating units as identifiable groups of assets that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing if the carrying value of a cash generating unit, including the allocated goodwill, exceeds its recoverable amount determined as the greater of the estimated fair value less costs of disposal or the value in use. Impairment losses recognized in respect of a cash generating unit are first allocated to the carrying value of goodwill and any excess is allocated to the carrying amount of assets in the cash generating unit. Any goodwill impairment is charged to profit or loss in the period in which the impairment is identified. Impairment losses on goodwill are not subsequently reversed. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. (m)Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to Brookfield Infrastructure and the revenue and costs incurred or to be incurred can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of estimated customer returns, trade allowances, rebates and other similar allowances. When the partnership receives a transfer of cash or property, plant and equipment from a customer, it assesses whether the constructed or acquired item of property, plant and equipment meets the definition of an asset in accordance with IFRIC 18, Transfer of Assets from Customers. If the definition of an asset is met, the partnership recognizes the item of property, plant and equipment at its cost and recognizes revenue or deferred revenue, as applicable, for the same amount based on the appropriate revenue recognition policy. Brookfield Infrastructure recognizes revenue when the specific criteria have also been met for each of Brookfield Infrastructure's activities as described below. Cash received by Brookfield Infrastructure from customers is recorded as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met. Utilities Revenue from utilities infrastructure is derived from the distribution and transmission of energy as well as from Brookfield Infrastructure's Australian regulated terminal operation. Distribution and transmission revenue is recognized when services are rendered based upon usage or volume during that Brookfield Infrastructure F-19 BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 period. Terminal infrastructure charges are charged at set rates per tonne of coal based on each customer's annual contracted tonnage and is then recognized on a pro-rata basis each month. Brookfield Infrastructure's Australian regulated terminal operation also recognizes handling charges based on tonnes of coal shipped through the terminal. Transport Revenue from transport infrastructure consists primarily of freight and transportation services revenue. Revenue is recognized when services are provided and rendered based primarily on usage or volume throughput during the period. Energy Revenue from energy infrastructure consists primarily of energy distribution and storage as well as district energy services. Revenue is recognized when services are provided and rendered based primarily on usage or volume throughput during the period. (n)Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting The following summarizes Brookfield Infrastructure's classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities: Classification Measurement Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents Loans and receivables Amortized cost Accounts receivable and other Loans and receivables Amortized cost Restricted cash and deposits Loans and receivables Amortized cost Marketable securities Available-for-sale Fair value Financial assets Derivative assets FVTPL(1) Fair value Other financial assets Loans and receivables/ Available-for-sale Amortized cost/ Fair value Financial liabilities Corporate borrowings Other liabilities Amortized cost Non-recourse borrowings Other liabilities Amortized cost(2) Accounts payable and other Other liabilities Amortized cost Preferred shares Other liabilities Amortized cost Financial liabilities FVTPL Fair value (1) Fair value through profit or loss ("FVTPL"). (2) Except for derivatives embedded in the related financial instruments that are classified as FVTPL and measured at fair value. The partnership maintains a portfolio of marketable securities comprised of liquid equity and debt infrastructure securities. The marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date with the change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognized in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the asset is F-20 Brookfield Infrastructure BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. Brookfield Infrastructure selectively utilizes derivative financial instruments primarily to manage financial risks, including interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied when the derivative is designated as a hedge of a specific exposure and there is assurance that it will continue to be highly effective as a hedge based on an expectation of offsetting cash flows or fair value. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the derivative no longer qualifies as a hedge or the hedging relationship is terminated. Once discontinued, the cumulative change in fair value of a derivative that was previously recorded in other comprehensive income by the application of hedge accounting is recognized in profit or loss over the remaining term of the original hedging relationship as amounts related to the hedged item are recognized in profit and loss. The assets or liabilities relating to unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on derivative financial instruments are recorded in Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, respectively. (i)Items Classified as Hedges Realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts, designated as hedges of currency risks relating to a net investment in a subsidiary with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are included in equity and are included in net income in the period in which the subsidiary is disposed of or to the extent partially disposed and control is not retained. Derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges to offset corresponding changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities and cash flows are measured at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded in profit or loss or as a component of equity as applicable. Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate contracts designated as hedges of future variable interest payments are included in equity as a cash flow hedge when the interest rate risk relates to an anticipated variable interest payment. The periodic exchanges of payments on interest rate swap contracts designated as hedges of debt are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense. The periodic exchanges of payments on interest rate contracts designated as hedges of future interest payments are amortized into profit or loss over the term of the corresponding interest payments. (ii)Items Not Classified as Hedges Derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedges are carried at estimated fair value, and gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognized in net income in the period the changes occur. Realized and unrealized gains on other derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in other expenses. Other financial assets are classified as loans and receivables or available-for-sale securities based on their nature and use within the Partnership's business and are recorded initially at fair value. Other financial assets classified as available-for-sale are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date with the change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. Other financial assets classified as loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Assets classified as loans and receivables are impaired when there exists objective evidence that the financial asset is impaired. Brookfield Infrastructure F-21 BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (o)Income Taxes Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax accrued in the period and deferred tax. (i)Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid to tax authorities, net of recoveries based on the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current income tax relating to items recognized directly in partnership capital are also recognized directly in partnership capital and other comprehensive income. (ii)Deferred tax Deferred income tax liabilities are provided for using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases used in the computation of taxable income and carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that deductions, tax credits and tax losses can be utilized. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable income nor the accounting income. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent it is no longer probable that the income tax asset will be recovered. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where Brookfield Infrastructure is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable income against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which Brookfield Infrastructure expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority within a single taxable entity or Brookfield Infrastructure intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis in the case where there exist different taxable entities in the same taxation authority and when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities. (p)Assets Held for Sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition F-22 Brookfield Infrastructure BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the non-current asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification subject to limited exceptions. When Brookfield Infrastructure is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether Brookfield Infrastructure will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale. Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group are presented separately from other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are classified as current. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Once classified as held for sale, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, are not depreciated or amortized, respectively. (q)Provisions Provisions are recognized when Brookfield Infrastructure has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that Brookfield Infrastructure will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. (r)Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty The preparation of financial statements requires management to make critical judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources, during the reporting period. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Brookfield Infrastructure F-23 BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 Critical judgments made by management and utilized in the normal course of preparing Brookfield Infrastructure's consolidated financial statements are outlined below. (i)Common control transactions IFRS 3 (2008) does not include specific measurement guidance for transfers of businesses or subsidiaries between entities under common control. Accordingly, Brookfield Infrastructure has developed a policy to account for such transactions taking into consideration other guidance in the IFRS framework and pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies. Brookfield Infrastructure's policy is to record assets and liabilities recognized as a result of transactions between entities under common control at the carrying value on the transferor's financial statements, and to have the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, Consolidated Statements of Operating Results, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Statements of Cash Flows reflect the results of combining entities for all periods presented for which the entities were under the transferor's common control, irrespective of when the combination takes place. (ii)Classification of assets and liabilities as held for sale Judgment is applied in determining whether the results of operations associated with the assets should be recorded in discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operating Results. Brookfield Infrastructure will reclassify the results of operations associated with certain assets to discontinued operations where the assets represent a component of the partnership whose operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the partnership. (iii)Financial instruments Brookfield Infrastructure's accounting policies relating to derivative financial instruments are described in note 3(n). The critical judgments inherent in these policies relate to applying the criteria to the assessment of the effectiveness of hedging relationships. Estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of financial instruments are equity and commodity prices; future interest rates; the credit worthiness of the company relative to its counterparties; the credit risk of the company's counterparties relative to the company; estimated future cash flows; and discount rates. (iv)Revaluation of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is revalued on a regular basis. The critical estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation of property, plant and equipment are set out in note 13. (v)Valuation of standing timber Changes in fair value are recorded in profit and loss during the period of change. Brookfield Infrastructure determines fair value on an annual basis. Certain assets recorded at fair value were estimated and determined by management of the Partnership with due consideration given to other relevant data points. Key estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of standing timber are: the timing of forecasted revenues and timber prices; estimated selling costs; sustainable felling plans; growth assumptions; silviculture costs; discount rates; terminal capitalization rates and terminal valuation dates. F-24 Brookfield Infrastructure BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (vi)Valuation of investment property The fair value of investment property is primarily determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of each property, generally over a term of 10 years, using a discount and terminal capitalization rate reflective of the characteristics, location and market of each property. The future cash flows of each property are based upon, among other things, rental income from current leases and assumptions about rental income from future leases reflecting current conditions, less future cash outflows in respect of such current and future leases. In some cases, the fair values are determined based on recent real estate transactions with similar characteristics and location to those of Brookfield Infrastructure. Fair value is estimated by management of the Partnership with due consideration given to other relevant data points. (vii)Fair values in business combinations Brookfield Infrastructure accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the application of fair values for both the consideration given and the assets and liabilities acquired. The calculation of fair values is often predicated on estimates and judgments including future cash flows, revenue streams and value-in-use calculations (refer to note 4 for details of business combinations). The determination of the fair values may remain provisional for up to 12 months from the date of acquisition due to the time required to obtain independent valuations of individual assets and to complete assessments of provisions. When the accounting for a business combination has not been completed as at the reporting date, this is disclosed in the financial statements, including observations on the estimates and judgments made as of the reporting date. (viii)Impairment of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives The impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives requires an estimation of the value-in-use or fair value less costs of disposal of the cash-generating units to which goodwill or the intangible asset has been allocated. Brookfield Infrastructure uses the following critical assumptions and estimates: the tax circumstances that gave rise to the goodwill, timing and amount of future cash flows expected from the cash-generating unit; discount rates; terminal capitalization rates; terminal valuation dates; useful lives and residual values. Other estimates utilized in the preparation of the partnership's financial statements are: depreciation and amortization rates and useful lives; recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets; ability to utilize tax losses and other tax measurements. Other critical judgments utilized in the preparation of the partnership's financial statements include the determination of functional currency, determination of operating segments, determination of effectiveness of financial hedges for accounting purposes, recoverability of deferred tax assets and assessment of tax uncertainties, and determination of control. Brookfield Infrastructure F-25 BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (s)Recently Adopted Accounting Policies Brookfield Infrastructure applied, for the first time, certain Standards and amendments to Standards applicable to Brookfield Infrastructure that became effective January 1, 2013. The impact of adopting these Standards on the partnership's accounting policies and disclosures are as follows: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements ("IFRS 10") IFRS 10 replaces IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and SIC 12 ConsolidationSpecial Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 introduces a single control model for consolidation, irrespective of the nature of the investee. An investor that exerts power over the investee, has exposure to variable returns and has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns, controls the investee and accordingly, is required to consolidate the investee. IFRS 10 was applied retrospectively and the application of this new Standard had no impact on Brookfield Infrastructure's accounting for and presentation of investees for the current or prior periods presented. IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements ("IFRS 11") and IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures ("IAS 28") IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC 13 Jointly-controlled Entities  Non-monetary Contributions by Venturers. IFRS 11 removes the option to account for jointly controlled entities using proportionate consolidation. Instead, entities that meet the definition of a joint venture under IFRS 11 must be accounted for using the equity method. Accordingly, IAS 28 has been amended to include the application of the equity method to investments in joint ventures. The classification of a joint arrangement as a joint operation or a joint venture depends upon the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Those parties are joint operators. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. IFRS 11 was applied retrospectively and the application of this new Standard had no impact on Brookfield Infrastructure's accounting for and presentation of investees for the current and prior periods presented. IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities ("IFRS 12") IFRS 12 integrates the disclosure requirements of interests in other entities to disclose information about significant judgments and assumptions the investor has made in determining whether it has control, joint control, or significant influence over another entity and the type of joint arrangement when the arrangement has been structured through a separate vehicle. Entities are also required to provide these disclosures when changes in facts and circumstances affect the entity's conclusion during the reporting period. IFRS 12 was applied prospectively. The application of this new Standard led to additional disclosures with regards to the Brookfield Infrastructure's interests in other entities. These disclosures provide further details regarding Brookfield Infrastructure's non-wholly owned subsidiaries and have been included in note 26 and note 12.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement ("IFRS 13") IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance for fair value measurements. The Standard defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. The scope of IFRS 13 is broad; it applies to both financial instruments and non-financial items for which other IFRSs require or permit fair value measurements, except in specified circumstances. IFRS 13 was applied prospectively and has not materially impacted the manner in which Brookfield Infrastructure measures its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. In general, the disclosure requirements for the fair value of financial instruments and non-financial items under IFRS 13 are more extensive than those required under previous Standards. The application of this new Standard led to additional disclosures with regard to the valuation methods applied in determining the fair value of Brookfield Infrastructure's property, plant and equipment (see note 13), investment property (see note 17) and financial instruments (see note 7). IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income  Amendments to IAS 1 ("IAS 1") Brookfield Infrastructure adopted the amendments to IAS 1 on January 1, 2013 with retrospective application. The amendments to IAS 1 require items to be presented in other comprehensive income ("OCI") in two separate categories: (a) items that could be reclassified to profit or loss at a future point in time (e.g., impact of translation of foreign operations and net movement on cash flow hedges) and; (b) items that will never be reclassified to profit or loss (e.g., revaluation of property, plant and equipment). Income tax on items of other comprehensive income is required to be allocated on the same basis. Brookfield Infrastructure has amended the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for all periods presented to reflect the presentation changes required under these amendments. Since these changes constitute reclassifications within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, there is no net impact on comprehensive income. IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures("IFRS 7") The amendments to IFRS 7 contain new disclosure requirements for financial assets and liabilities that are offset in the statement of financial position or subject to master netting arrangements or similar arrangements. The amendments to IFRS 7 have been applied prospectively. The application of these amendments has led to additional disclosures regarding the offsetting of financial instruments. These additional disclosures have been included in note 7. (t)Future Changes in Accounting Policies Standards issued, but not yet adopted IFRS 9, Financial Instruments ("IFRS 9") was issued by the IASB on November 12, 2009 and will replace IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement ("IAS 39"). IFRS 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at amortized cost or fair value, replacing the multiple rules in IAS 39. The approach in IFRS 9 is based on how an entity manages its financial instruments in the context of its business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. The new Standard also requires a single impairment method to be used, replacing the Brookfield Infrastructure F-27 BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 multiple impairment methods in IAS 39. IFRS 9 is tentatively effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Brookfield Infrastructure is currently evaluating the impact of IFRS 9 on its consolidated financial statements. IFRIC 21, Levies ("IFRIC 21") provides guidance on when to recognize a liability for a levy imposed by a government, both for levies that are accounted for in accordance with IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, and those where the timing and amount of the levy is certain. IFRIC 21 identifies the obligating event for the recognition of a liability as the activity that triggers the payment of the levy in accordance with the relevant legislation. A liability is recognized progressively if the obligating event occurs over a period of time or, if an obligation is triggered on reaching a minimum threshold, the liability is recognized when that minimum threshold is reached. IFRIC 21 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014. Management is currently evaluating the impact of IFRIC 21 on the consolidated financial statements. IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation ("IAS 32") was amended to clarify certain aspects as a result of the application of offsetting requirements, namely focusing on the following four main areas: the interpretation of "currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off", the application of simultaneous realization and settlement, the offsetting of collateral amounts, and the unit of account for applying the offsetting requirements. IAS 32 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014. Management is currently evaluating the impact of IAS 32 on the consolidated financial statements. NOTE 4. ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES (a)Acquisition of U.K. Regulated Distribution operation On November 13, 2012, Brookfield Infrastructure acquired a 100% interest in Inexus Group Limited, its U.K. regulated distribution operation, for consideration of $468 million. As part of this transaction, Brookfield Infrastructure also injected an additional $57 million into its existing UK regulated distribution operation to settle interest rate swaps in advance of the £600 million acquisition financing executed by the combined company. Since Brookfield Infrastructure has the right to elect the majority of the Board of Directors thereby providing Brookfield Infrastructure with control, the partnership consolidates the entity. Acquisition costs of $1 million were expensed at the acquisition date and recorded as other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operating Results.

Brookfield Infrastructure's results from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 include $20 million of revenue and $7 million of net loss from the U.K. regulated distribution operation. (b)Acquisition of Chilean Toll Roads On December 16, 2011, Brookfield Infrastructure invested $159 million for a 25% interest in Sociedad Concesionario Vespucio Norte Express S.A. ("AVN"), a Chilean toll road, through a Brookfield sponsored partnership. At that time, the investment was classified as an investment in an associate and accounted for using the equity method. On October 1, 2012, Brookfield Infrastructure acquired an additional 26% interest in AVN for $170 million, bringing Brookfield Infrastructure's total ownership interest to 51%. Concurrently, Brookfield Infrastructure entered into a voting agreement with an affiliate of Brookfield, providing Brookfield Infrastructure the right to elect the majority of the Board of Directors of the entity thereby providing Brookfield Infrastructure with control. Accordingly, Brookfield Infrastructure consolidates the entity. Acquisition costs of $1 million were expensed at the acquisition date and recorded as other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operating Results.

NOTE 5. PARTIAL DISPOSITION OF UK REGULATED DISTRIBUTION OPERATION In November 2012, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Infrastructure entered into an arrangement whereby a 20% economic interest in its UK regulated distribution operation was sold to an institutional investor for £145 million subject to the UK regulated distribution operation attaining long-term financing under certain pre-defined contractual terms. In the event that the UK regulated distribution operation did not obtain long-term financing at the contractually specified terms within two years of the arrangement, the institutional investor had the right to request repayment of £145 million plus 3% interest. Consequently, the proceeds were recorded as a financial liability. In March 2013, the UK regulated distribution operation satisfied the requirements within the contractual terms of the arrangement, which resulted in the derecognition of the financial liability as the £145 million initially received under the arrangement was recognized as proceeds on the disposal of a partial interest of a subsidiary. The partial disposition of Brookfield Infrastructure's 20% interest in the UK regulated distribution operation resulted in an adjustment to the carrying amounts of controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect the change in interest in the subsidiary. The difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration received was recognized directly in equity.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair values are determined by reference to quoted bid or ask prices, as appropriate. Where bid and ask prices are unavailable, the closing price of the most recent transaction of that instrument is used. In the absence of an active market, fair values are determined based on prevailing market rates (bid and ask prices, as appropriate) for instruments with similar characteristics and risk profiles or internal or external valuation models, such as option pricing models and discounted cash flow analyses, using observable market inputs. Fair values determined using valuation models require the use of assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and discount rates. In determining those assumptions, Brookfield Infrastructure looks primarily to external readily observable market inputs such as interest rate yield curves, currency rates, and price and rate volatilities as applicable. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts which form part of financing arrangements is calculated by way of discounted cash flows using market interest rates and applicable credit spreads. Classification of Financial Instruments Financial instruments classified as fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Changes in the fair values of financial instruments classified as fair value through profit or loss are recognized in profit and loss. Mark-to-market adjustments on hedging items for those in an effective hedging relationship and changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are recognized in other comprehensive income. These items have been segregated from Other (expenses) income to reflect the significance of these changes in the current period. Mark-to-market losses on financial instruments carried at fair value of $49 million and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, have been reclassified from other (expenses) income to mark-to-market on hedging items on the Consolidated Statements of Operating Results to conform with current period presentation.

Hedging Activities Brookfield Infrastructure uses derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments to manage or maintain exposures to interest and currency risks. For certain derivatives which are used to manage exposures, Brookfield Infrastructure determines whether hedge accounting can be applied. When hedge accounting can be applied, a hedge relationship can be designated as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or a hedge of foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. To qualify for hedge accounting the derivative must be highly effective in accomplishing the objective of offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at inception and over the life of the hedge. If it is determined that the derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. Cash Flow Hedges Brookfield Infrastructure uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows related to a variable rate asset or liability and highly probably forecast issuances of debt. The settlement dates typically coincide with the dates on which the interest is payable on the underlying debt, and the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect profit or loss. For the year ended December 31, 2013, pre-tax net unrealized losses of $13 million (2012: losses of $29 million, 2011: losses of $94 million) were recorded in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the cash flow hedges. As at December 31, 2013, there was a net unrealized derivative liability balance of $31 million relating to derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges (2012: $146 million, 2011: $118 million). During the year, a gain of less than $1 million (2012: losses of less than $1 million, 2011: losses of less than $1 million) was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operating results as it pertains to the pre-tax net unrealized losses noted above. Net Investment Hedges Brookfield Infrastructure uses foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt instruments to manage its foreign currency exposures arising from net investments in foreign operations having a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2013, unrealized pre-tax net gains of $14 million (2012: losses of $19 million, 2011: gains of $30 million) were recorded in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Further, Brookfield Infrastructure recognized a $26 million loss (2012: $10 million gain, 2011: loss of $60 million) in other comprehensive income relating to the net settlement of foreign exchange contracts in the period. As at December 31, 2013, there was a net unrealized derivative asset balance of $8 million relating to derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges (2012: net unrealized derivative liability balance of $6 million).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 Fair Value Hierarchical LevelsFinancial Instruments Fair value hierarchical levels are directly determined by the amount of subjectivity associated with the valuation inputs of these assets and liabilities, and are as follows: Level 1  Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2  Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's anticipated life. Fair valued assets and liabilities that are included in this category are primarily certain derivative contracts and other financial assets carried at fair value in an inactive market. Level 3  Inputs reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to determining the estimate. Fair valued assets and liabilities that are included in this category are interest rate swap contracts, derivative contracts, certain equity securities carried at fair value which are not traded in an active market and the non-controlling interest's share of net assets of limited life funds. Fair value of the partnership's financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (2)In the fourth quarter of 2013, Brookfield Infrastructure sold its 42% interest in its Australasian energy distribution business to a third party for net proceeds of USD $415 million, resulting in a gain on disposition of $35 million recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Operating Results within the gain on sale of associates line item. As a result of the disposition, accumulated revaluation surplus of $80 million post-tax was reclassified from other comprehensive income directly to retained earnings and noted as an other item on the Consolidated Statements of Partnership Capital.

On October 1, 2012, Brookfield Infrastructure acquired an additional 26% interest in AVN for $170 million, through a Brookfield sponsored partnership, bringing Brookfield Infrastructure's total ownership interest to 51%. Concurrently, Brookfield Infrastructure entered into a voting agreement with an affiliate of Brookfield, providing Brookfield Infrastructure with the right to elect the majority of the Board of Directors of the entity thereby providing Brookfield Infrastructure with control. Accordingly, Brookfield Infrastructure consolidates the entity. Impairment of North American natural gas transmission operation Our North American natural gas transmission operation is a provider of natural gas transmission and storage services to the Chicago and Northern Indiana markets. In 2013, the North American natural gas transmission operation continued to be affected by weak market fundamentals in the U.S. natural gas market. Throughout 2013, the U.S. natural gas market experienced compressed basis spreads due to the build out of pipeline infrastructure as well as a decrease in gas prices driven by a fundamental shift in supply dynamics in the U.S. These factors in conjunction with regulatory approvals occurring in the later part of the year granted for the further build out or reversal of certain pipelines triggered an impairment of the operations' property, plant and equipment. The revaluation of property, plant and equipment within the associate resulted in an impairment charge attributable to the partnership of $275 million. The impairment was recorded in net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 and, as the charge represents a write-down of property, plant and equipment within an associate, was recognized within the share of (losses) earnings from investments in associates line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operating Results. The impairment charge of the North American natural gas transmission operation is reported within the energy operating segment. Below is a summary of the significant valuation assumptions utilized in measuring the fair value of the property, plant and equipment of the North American natural gas transmission operation for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (level 3 on the fair value hierarchy). The values assigned to the key assumptions represented management's assessment of future trends in the environment in which the North American natural gas transmission assets operate and were based on historical data from both external and internal sources. Valuation technique Significant valuation assumptions 2013 2012 Discounted cash flow Discount rate 10% 9% Terminal value multiple 11.6x 11.8x Terminal valuation date 10 years 10 years The current basis spread environment is a primary driver of market sensitive revenue for the North American natural gas transmission operation, meaning unsold capacity or contracts that are up for renewal within any given year, and therefore is a key assumption in the determination of fair value. Brookfield Infrastructure F-45 BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 Basis spreads are a primary indicator in predicting the negotiated rates at which the contracts will renew. Throughout 2013 basis spreads remained compressed and as a result, market sensitive negotiated rates were adjusted downwards at year end to reflect the current environment. The assumed rates are consistent with the assumption that a market participant would make. The discount rate represents the current market assessment of the risks specific to the North American natural gas transmission assets, taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated into the cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the underlying assets and is derived using an equity approach. The equity discount rate takes into account an optimized capital structure that a market participant would assume based on comparable entities operating in a comparable industry. Asset and industry-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors. The beta factors are evaluated based on publicly available market data. Terminal value multiples were derived using publicly available data for comparable companies that a market participant would use in forming a view on fair value. The terminal value as estimated represents the present value of operations at the end of the 10 year forecast period based on an assumed continuous hold from the perspective of a market participant.

Additionally, an increase in the discount rate could result in a decrease to the terminal value multiple which would further decrease the value of property, plant and equipment. Conversely, an increase to the terminal value multiple would increase the fair value of property, plant and equipment. At December 31, 2013, Brookfield Infrastructure carried out a review of the fair value of its Utility property, plant and equipment, resulting in a gain from revaluation of $269 million (2012: $168 million) which was recognized in revaluation surplus in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The carrying amount of Utility property, plant and equipment that would have been recognized had the assets been carried under the cost model is $3,140 million (2012: $3,094 million). At December 31, 2013, Brookfield Infrastructure carried out a review of the fair value of its Transport property, plant and equipment. A gain from revaluation of $318 million (2012: $359 million) was recognized in revaluation surplus in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The carrying amount of Transport assets that would have been recognized had the assets been carried under the cost model is $2,079 million (2012: $2,322 million). At December 31, 2013, Brookfield Infrastructure carried out a review of the fair value of its Energy property, plant and equipment. A gain from revaluation of $71 million (2012: $45 million) was recognized in revaluation surplus in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The carrying amount of Energy assets that would have been recognized had the assets been carried under the cost model is $1,083 million (2012: $1,012 million). At December 31, 2013, no review of fair value was completed for the U.S. and Canadian freehold timberlands' property, plant and equipment as these businesses were sold during the year ended December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2012, a gain from revaluation of $95 million was recorded, which as a reversal of a prior period impairment, was recognized as fair value adjustments in the Consolidated Statements of Operating Results. The fair value of the Partnership's property, plant and equipment are determined by management of the Partnership with due consideration given to other relevant data points. Key valuation assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2012 include a weighted average discount rate of 6% and an average terminal valuation date of approximately 90 years.

The deferred tax liability arose because tax bases of the net assets, to Brookfield, were significantly lower than their fair value. The inclusion of this liability in the net book value of the acquired business gave rise to goodwill of approximately $591 million. This goodwill was attributable to a single cash-generating unit (CGU) and is tested for impairment annually using a fair value less costs of disposal model. In July 2013, Brookfield Infrastructure sold its 30% interest in the U.S freehold timberlands business resulting in the disposal of $591 million of goodwill. NOTE 17.

Fair values are generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows of the properties. During the year ended December 31, 2013, Brookfield Infrastructure sold its 30% interest in the U.S freehold timberlands and 25% interest in its Canadian freehold timberlands resulting in the disposal of $54 million of investment properties.

PARTNERSHIP CAPITAL Brookfield Infrastructure's capital structure is comprised of three classes of partnership units: limited partnership units, general partnership units and Redeemable Partnership Units held by Brookfield. Limited partnership units entitle the holder to their proportionate share of distributions. General partnership units entitle the holder the right to govern the financial and operating policies of Brookfield Infrastructure. Further, in its capacity as the general partner of the Holding LP, the general partner is entitled to incentive distribution rights which are based on the amount by which quarterly distributions on partnership units exceed specified target levels. To the extent distributions on partnership units exceed $0.305 per quarter, the incentive distribution rights are entitled to 15% of incremental distributions above this threshold. To the extent that distributions on partnership units exceed $0.33 per unit, the incentive distribution rights are entitled to 25% of incremental distributions above this threshold. During the year, the partnership paid incentive distributions of $31 million (2012: $16 million, 2011: $6 million). The Holding LP has issued 58.7 million Redeemable Partnership Units to Brookfield, which may, at the request of the holder, require the Holding LP to redeem the units at the market price of the partnership. This right is subject to the partnership's right of first refusal which entitles it, at its sole discretion, to elect to acquire any unit so presented to the Holding LP in exchange for one of the partnership's units (subject to certain customary adjustments). Both the limited partnership issued by the partnership and the Redeemable Partnership Units issued by the Holding LP have the same economic attributes in all respects, except for the redemption right described above. The Redeemable Partnership Units participate in earnings and distributions on a per unit basis equivalent to the per unit participation of the limited partnership of the partnership. The partnership reflects the Redeemable Partnership Units issued to Brookfield by the Holding LP as non-controlling interestRedeemable Partnership Units held by Brookfield. In March 2014, the Holding LP underwent a restructuring whereby the Holding LP's limited partnership agreement was amended to make the partnership the managing general partner of the Holding LP by redesignating the limited partner units as managing general partner units and to make the general partner a special limited partner of the Holding LP by redesignating the general partner units to special limited partner units. This change was made in order to simplify our governance structure and to more clearly delineate our partnership's governance rights in respect of the Holding LP. There are no units reserved for issue under options or other contacts. F-68 Brookfield Infrastructure BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P.

In August 2012, Brookfield Infrastructure issued 11.3 million limited partnership units at $33.25 under our shelf registrations in the U.S. and Canada. In total, $370 million of gross proceeds were raised through the issuance and $15 million in equity issuance costs were incurred. In June 2010, we implemented a distribution reinvestment plan ("the Plan") that allows eligible holders of the partnership to purchase additional units by reinvesting their cash distributions. Under the Plan, units are acquired at a price per unit calculated by reference to the volume weighted average of the trading price for our units on the New York Stock Exchange for the five trading days immediately preceding the relevant distribution date. During the period, our partnership issued less than 1 million units for proceeds of $7 million (2012: less than 1 million units for proceeds of $3 million, 2011: less than 1 million units for less than $1 million) under the Plan.

These guarantees are generally supported by cash on deposit with banks. The Partnership and its subsidiaries are contingently liable with respect to litigation and claims that arise in the normal course of operations. NOTE 32. CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS In the normal course of business, the partnership will enter into contractual obligations which include commitments relating primarily to contracted project costs for various growth initiatives and network upgrades at our Australian railroad operation and committed expenditures associated with gas and electricity sales contracts at our UK regulated distribution operation. As at December 31, 2013, the Partnership had $131 million (2012: $425 million) of such commitments outstanding. In addition, pursuant to the Master Service Agreement, on a quarterly basis, Brookfield Infrastructure pays a base management fee to wholly owned subsidiaries of Brookfield (the "Service Provider") equal to 0.3125% per quarter (1.25% annually) of the market value of the Partnership.

Less than $1 million in director fees were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2013 (2012: less than $1 million, 2011: less than $1 million). (b)Transactions with other related parties Since inception, Brookfield Infrastructure had a management agreement with its external managers, wholly owned subsidiaries of Brookfield. Pursuant to the Master Services Agreement, on a quarterly basis, Brookfield Infrastructure pays a base management fee, referred to as the Base Management Fee, to the Service Provider equal to 0.3125% per quarter (1.25% annually) of the market value of the partnership. The Base Management Fee was $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 (2012: $86 million, 2011: $53 million). For purposes of calculating the Base Management Fee, the market value of the partnership is equal to the volume weighted average of the closing prices of the partnership's units on the NYSE (or other exchange or market where the partnership's units are principally traded) for each of the last five trading days of the applicable quarter multiplied by the number of issued and outstanding units of the partnership on the last of those days (assuming full conversion of Brookfield's interest in Brookfield Infrastructure into units of the partnership), plus the amount of third-party debt, net of cash, with recourse to the partnership, Brookfield Infrastructure, the Holding LP and certain holding entities held directly by the Holding LP. During the year, $8 million was reimbursed at cost to the Service Provider (2012: $9 million, 2011: $9 million). These amounts represent third party costs that were paid for by Brookfield on behalf of Brookfield Infrastructure relating to general and administrative expenses, and acquisition related expenses of Brookfield Infrastructure. These expenses were charged to Brookfield Infrastructure at cost. Brookfield Infrastructure has placed funds on deposit with Brookfield. Interest earned on the deposits is at market terms. At December 31, 2013, Brookfield Infrastructure's deposit balance with Brookfield was $262 million (2012: less than $1 million, 2011: $76 million) and earned interest of less than $1million for the year (2012: less than $1 million, 2011: less than $1 million). Brookfield Infrastructure's North American district energy operation has various right-of-way easements and leases office space on market terms with subsidiaries of Brookfield Office Properties Inc. The North American district energy operation also utilizes consulting and engineering services provided by a wholly owned subsidiaries of Brookfield on market terms. In October 2012, Brookfield Infrastructure agreed to purchase an additional 10% investment in its South American transmission operations from Brookfield for proceeds of $235 million, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, increasing Brookfield Infrastructure's total ownership to 28%. The purchase was completed in January 2013 with an effective date of October 1, 2012.

All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Partnership's cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.

NOTE 36. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Brookfield Infrastructure recognizes that risk management is an integral part of good management practice. Brookfield Infrastructure is exposed to the following risks as a result of holding financial instruments: capital risk; liquidity risk; market risk (i.e. interest rate risk and foreign currency risk); and credit risk. The following is a description of these risks and how they are managed: (a)Capital Risk Management Brookfield Infrastructure manages its capital structure to be able to continue as a going concern while maximizing the return to stakeholders. Brookfield Infrastructure's overall capital strategy remains unchanged from 2012. The capital structure of Brookfield Infrastructure consists of debt, offset by cash and cash equivalents, and partnership capital comprised of issued capital and accumulated gains. US$ MILLIONS 2013 2012 Subsidiary and corporate borrowings $ 6,167 $ 7,939 Preferred shares 20 20 Cash and cash equivalents(1) (768 ) (263 ) Net Debt 5,419 7,696 Total partnership capital 6,605 7,808 Total capital and net debt $ 12,024 $ 15,504 Net debt to capitalization ratio 45% 50% (1)Includes marketable securities. The Board, along with senior management of the Service Provider, reviews Brookfield Infrastructure's capital structure and as part of this review, considers the cost of capital and the risk associated with each class of capital. Brookfield Infrastructure manages its debt exposure by financing its operations on a non-recourse basis with prudent levels of debt, ensuring a diversity of funding sources as well as laddering its maturity profile to minimize refinance risk. Brookfield Infrastructure also strives to borrow in the currency where the asset operates, where possible, in order to hedge its currency risk. Generally, Brookfield Infrastructure's equity strategy is to issue equity in conjunction with future acquisitions. However, Brookfield Infrastructure may also issue an amount of equity opportunistically to enhance its liquidity to pursue investments. Brookfield Infrastructure maintains active shelf registrations to enable it to issue securities in both the U.S. and Canadian markets. Brookfield Infrastructure's financing plan is to fund its recurring growth capital expenditures with cash flow generated by its operations after maintenance capital expenditure, as well as debt financing that is sized to maintain its credit profile. To fund large scale development projects and acquisitions, F-76 Brookfield Infrastructure BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 Brookfield Infrastructure will evaluate a variety of capital sources including proceeds from selling non-core assets, equity and debt financing. The partnership will seek to raise additional equity if Brookfield Infrastructure believes it can earn returns on these investments in excess of the cost of the incremental partnership capital. As disclosed within borrowings (note 20), Brookfield Infrastructure has various loan facilities in place. In certain cases, the facilities have financial covenants which are generally in the form of interest coverage ratios and leverage ratios. Brookfield Infrastructure does not have any market capitalization covenants attached to any of its borrowings, nor does it have any other externally imposed capital requirements. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no breaches of any loan covenants within Brookfield Infrastructure. (b)Liquidity Risk Management Brookfield Infrastructure attempts to maintain sufficient financial liquidity at all times so that it is able to participate in attractive opportunities as they arise, better withstand sudden adverse changes in economic circumstances and maintain a relatively high distribution of its Funds from operations ("FFO") to unitholders. Brookfield Infrastructure's principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from its operations, undrawn credit facilities and access to public and private capital markets. Brookfield Infrastructure also structures the ownership of its assets to enhance its ability to monetize them to provide additional liquidity, if necessary. Brookfield Infrastructure's estimated corporate liquidity as at December 31 is as follows: US$ MILLIONS 2013 2012 Corporate cash and financial assets(1) $ 523 $ 2 Availability under committed credit facility(1) 1,400 855 Draws on credit facility(1)  (546 ) Commitments under credit facility(1) (99 ) (92 ) Estimated corporate liquidity(1) $ 1,824 $ 219 (1)Corporate level only. Brookfield Infrastructure's $1.4 billion committed revolving credit facility is available for investments and acquisitions, as well as general corporate purposes. Commitments under the facility will be available on a revolving basis until September 2017. All amounts outstanding at that time will be repayable in full. The facility is intended to be a bridge to equity financing rather than a permanent source of capital. At December 31, 2013, there were $nil draws on this facility (2012: $546 million, 2011: $nil) and $99 million was committed to letters of credit (2012: $92 million, 2011: $51 million). The following tables detail the contractual maturities for Brookfield Infrastructure's financial liabilities. The tables reflect the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which Brookfield Infrastructure can be required to pay. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows. Brookfield Infrastructure F-77 BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P.

(c)Market Risk Market risk is defined for these purposes as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by Brookfield Infrastructure will fluctuate because of the change in market prices. Market risk includes the risk of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. F-78 Brookfield Infrastructure BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 Brookfield Infrastructure seeks to minimize the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by Brookfield Infrastructure's Treasury Policy. Brookfield Infrastructure does not enter into, or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. The Treasury Policy provides written principles on the use of financial derivatives. With respect to its treasury policy, senior management of Brookfield Infrastructure's external service provider perform the monitoring, review and approval role and report to the Board on a regular basis. Financial instruments held by Brookfield Infrastructure that are subject to market risk include other financial assets, borrowings, derivative instruments, such as interest rate and foreign currency contracts, and marketable securities. The partnership is exposed to equity price risks arising from marketable securities. As at December 31, 2013 the balance of the portfolio was $230 million (2012: $nil), a 10% change in the value of the portfolio would impact our equity by $23 million and result in an impact on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income of $23 million. Interest Rate Risk Management Brookfield Infrastructure's primary objectives with respect to interest rate risk management are to ensure that: Brookfield Infrastructure is not exposed to interest rate movements that could adversely impact its ability to meet financial obligations; Earnings and distributions are not adversely affected; Volatility of debt servicing costs is managed within acceptable parameters; and All borrowing covenants under various borrowing facilities, including interest coverage ratios, are complied with. To achieve these objectives, in general terms, Brookfield Infrastructure's funding mix comprises both fixed and floating rate debt. Fixed rate debt is achieved either through fixed rate debt funding or through the use of financial derivate instruments. In addition, where possible, interest rate risk is minimized by matching the terms of interest rate swap contracts in regulated businesses to the term of the rate period, thus providing natural hedges. The sensitivity analyses below reflect Brookfield Infrastructure's exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the reporting date, assuming that a 10 basis point increase or decrease in rates takes place at the beginning of the financial year and is held constant throughout the reporting period. The sensitivity analyses assume a 10 basis point change to reflect the current methodology employed by Brookfield Infrastructure in assessing interest rate risk. Such parallel shift in the yield curve by 10 basis points would have had the following impact, assuming all other variables were held constant: 2013 2012 2011 US$ MILLIONS 10 bp decrease 10 bp increase 10 bp decrease 10 bp increase 10 bp decrease 10 bp increase Net income (loss) $ 2 $ (2 ) $ 4 $ (4 ) $ 3 $ (2 ) Other comprehensive (loss) income (4 ) 4 (14 ) 14 (2 ) 3 Brookfield Infrastructure F-79 BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P.

From a treasury perspective, counterparty credit risk is managed through the establishment of authorized counterparty credit limits which ensure that Brookfield Infrastructure only deals with credit worthy counterparties and that counterparty concentration is addressed and the risk of loss is mitigated. Credit limits are sufficiently low to restrict Brookfield Infrastructure from having credit exposures concentrated with a single counterparty but rather encourages spreading such risks among several parties. The limits are set at levels that reflect Brookfield Infrastructure's scale of activity and allow it to manage its treasury business competitively. Brookfield Infrastructure does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. Exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of the assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. F-82 Brookfield Infrastructure BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS L.P.

SEGMENT INFORMATION IFRS 8, Operating Segments, requires operating segments to be determined based on internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the Executive Management and the Board of Directors for the purpose of allocating resources to the segment and to assessing its performance. Key measures used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") in assessing performance and in making resource allocation decisions are funds from operations ("FFO") and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA"), measures not defined by IFRS, which enable the determination of cash return on the equity deployed. FFO is calculated as net income excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, breakage and transaction costs, non-cash valuation gains or losses and other items. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as FFO excluding the impact of interest expense, cash taxes and other cash income (expenses).
