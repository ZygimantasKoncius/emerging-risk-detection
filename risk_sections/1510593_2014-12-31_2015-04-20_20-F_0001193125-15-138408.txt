D. Risk FactorsRisks related to our businessRegulation and censorship of information disseminated over the internet in China, recently strengthened, may adversely affect our business, and we may be liable for digital media content on our platform. In the future, there may be other laws and regulations that lead to further voluntary or forced removal of content or other measures to ensure compliance with standards set out by relevant regulatory authorities, which may further reduce our subscriber base. Currently, we are unable to quantify the magnitude and extent of such impact, although we expect our number of subscribers may experience decline in the near future. Online advertising. Our online advertising revenues were historically derived principally from various forms of advertisements that we place on Xunlei Kankan. A significant majority of our advertisers purchase our online advertising services through third-party advertising agencies. As is customary in the advertising industry in China, we pay rebates to third-party advertising agencies and recognize revenues net of these rebates. Historically, we derived advertising revenues of US$16.8 million, US$3.1 million and US$1.9 million from Xunlei Accelerator and US$45.0 million, US$44.9 million and US$36.4 million from Xunlei Kankan in the years 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. In the first half of 2013, we discontinued delivering advertisements on Xunlei Accelerator to further improve user experience and enhance user engagement, and do not expect to generate significant advertising revenues from Xunlei Accelerator after 2014. We also do not expect to generate significant advertising revenues in the future, if at all, if we complete our proposed sale of Xunlei Kankan to an independent third party.
