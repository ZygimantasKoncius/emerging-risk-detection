ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations or prospects, financial or otherwise. REDUCTION IN PRESENT LEVELS OF CASH FLOW COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS BUSINESS The Companys primary source of liquidity over the past 12 months has been operating cash flows. The Companys future cash flows from operations (on both a short term and long term basis) are dependent upon, but not limited to: · the Companys ability to attract new customers that will sell the Companys products and pay for them; · the Companys ability to retain the Companys existing customers at the level of sales previously produced; · the volume of sales for these customers; · the loss of business of one or more primary customers; · changes in types of products that the customers purchase in their sales mix; · the volume of royalty income paid to the Company by its licensees based upon the terms of each royalty agreement, including the inability to negotiate favorable royalty arrangements and renew current arrangements with certain existing favorable terms; · poor or deteriorating economic conditions which would directly impact the ability of the Companys customers to remain in business and pay for their products on a timely basis; · managements ability to hold the line on any requests for increases in material or labor cost increases; and · the ability to collect in full and in a timely manner, amounts due to the Company. In addition, as noted above, the Companys cash flow is also dependent, to some extent, upon the ability to maintain operating margins. The continuing general downturn in economic conditions or other events that caused the Companys customers to turn to lower-priced, lower-margin products, the Companys cash flow and profitability could be materially and adversely affected. 5 FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS TO SELL THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES VOLUME AND FUTURE PROFITABILITY The Company markets a line of products used by consumers to listen to music. The Company distributes these products through retail channels in the U.S. and independent distributors throughout the rest of the world. The Company is dependent upon the Companys ability to retain an existing base of customers to sell the Companys line of products. Loss of customers means loss of product placement. The Company has broad distribution across many channels including specialty stores, mass merchants, electronics stores and computer retailers. Since distribution is broadly based, any loss of a customer directly translates into a reduction in sales volume which can only be replaced by replacing a similar number of representative retail outlets. The inability of the Companys sales and marketing staff to obtain new distribution outlets translates into a lack of future growth and possibly a setback in sales volumes when loss of current customers occur. For example, the loss of a customer representing 10% of the Companys business would translate into a reduction in revenues of up to 10% based upon the point through the fiscal year that the customer was lost. Attracting a new customer during the course of a fiscal year could have a positive impact or simply replace an account which has been lost. In addition, a customer can decide to make a change in the models that it decides to offer for sale. Such changes can take place arbitrarily throughout the course of a year which can cause reductions in sales revenues in proportion to the number of retail outlets that the store represents in the market. The Company may not be able to maintain customers or model selections and therefore experience a reduction in its sales revenue until a model is restored to the mix or a customer is replaced by a new customer. A reduction in sales volume would cause a reduction in profitability. The Companys failure to retain existing customers, obtain new customers or develop new product lines that customers would choose to offer to consumers could significantly affect the Companys future profitability. The loss of business of one or more principal customers or a change in the sales volume from a particular customer could have a material adverse effect on the Companys sales volume and profitability. SHIFT IN CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS TO LOWER PRICED ITEMS CAN REDUCE PROFIT MARGINS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING PROFITABILITY The Company sells a line of products with a suggested retail price ranging from less than $10 up to $1,000. The gross margin for each of these models is unique in terms of percentages. The price range of the products also produces a different level of actual dollar contribution per unit. For example a product with a gross margin contribution of 50% might yield a $5.00 contribution for one item, while another item may feature a 30% gross margin which could yield $50.00. The Company finds the low priced portion of the market most competitive and therefore most subject to pressure on gross margin percentages, which tends to lower profit contributions. Retail preference for lower priced items can reduce profit margins and contributions. The risk is that a shift in retail customer specifications toward lower priced items can lead to lower gross margins and lower profit contributions per unit of sale. Due to the range of products that the Company sells, the product sales mix can produce a variation in terms of a range of profit margins. Some customers sell a limited range of products that yield lower profit margins than others. Most notably, the budget priced headphone segment of the market below $10.00 retail which is distributed through computer stores, office supply stores, and mass market retailers tend to yield the lowest gross margins. An increase in business with these types of accounts, if coupled with a simultaneous reduction in sales to customers with higher gross margins would reduce profit margins and profitability. POOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CAN RESTRICT OR LIMIT PRODUCT PLACEMENT, SALES AND REPLENISHMENT WHICH COULD DECREASE PROFITS Deteriorating or weak economic conditions, or a forecast for the same, can trigger changes in inventory stocking at retail. This may in turn lead to a reduction in model offerings and to out of stock situations. If a retail customer of the Company does not have adequate stocks of the Companys products to offer for sale in a retail store, consumers may choose another competitive model instead. Customers operating retail stores anticipate future sales demands and inventory products accordingly. Whenever a general economic slowdown occurs, at both the domestic or foreign level, sales volume levels and re-orders change. These changes directly impact the Companys sales and profitability. The Company is not in a position to determine how it will be affected by these circumstances, how extensive the effects may be, or for how long the Company may be impacted by these 6 circumstances. The Companys customers respond to changes in economic conditions and any adverse changes in economic conditions can therefore restrict product placement, availability, sales, replenishment and ultimately profitability. These conditions exist domestically and internationally. MANAGEMENT IS SUBJECT TO DECISIONS MADE OUTSIDE ITS CONTROL WHICH COULD DIRECTLY AFFECT FUTURE PROFITABILITY Retail customers determine which products they will stock for resale. The Company competes with other manufacturers to secure shelf space in retail stores for the Companys products. During the course of a year, changes in the customers management personnel can ultimately lead to changes in the stock assortment offered to consumers. These changes are often arbitrary. In addition to changes in personnel within the Companys customers, it is also possible that a strategic decision can be made by a retail customer to consolidate vendors, or to discontinue certain product categories altogether. In these instances, the Companys management team may not able to convince customers to reverse such decisions. The Companys management team is also engaged in the effective procurement, assembly, and manufacture of products. The ability to negotiate with suppliers, maintain productivity, and hold the line on cost increases can be subjected to pressures outside the control of management. For example, increases in fuel costs can increase rates of freight. Increases of this nature can seldom be avoided and the Company may not be able to pass such increases along to its customers. Managements effective control of the manufacturing processes will have a direct impact on the Companys future profitability. The Company regularly makes decisions that affect production schedules, shipping schedules, employee levels, and inventory levels. The Companys ability to make effective decisions in managing these areas has a direct effect on future profitability. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AMOUNTS DUE FROM OUR CUSTOMERS CAN BE LOST AS A RESULT OF CUSTOMER BANKRUPTCY, OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTY, OR FAILURE TO PAY, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING FUTURE PROFITABILITY The Company has significant accounts receivable or other amounts due from the Companys customers. The accounts receivable balance at the end of the last four quarters averaged approximately $8,967,067. Terms of payment for customers generally range from cash in advance to net 90 day credit terms. These credit arrangements are negotiated at unspecified and irregular intervals. The largest customers generate the largest receivable balances. If a customer develops operational difficulty it is not uncommon to temporarily suspend payment to vendors. The Company is subject to this risk in the retail marketplace. From time to time a customer may develop severe operating losses which can lead to a bankruptcy. In these cases, the Company may lose most of the outstanding balance due. Occasionally, the Company has been current with a customer at the time such an event occurs. The more material risk is that of losing the revenue of the customer which might be more onerous than losing the current outstanding accounts receivable. In addition, many companies that will insure accounts receivables will not do so for the Companys largest mass market customers. An example of such a loss was KMART Corporation. The Company recorded a loss of approximately $500,000 of which $44,000 was repaid in 2007, $37,000 in 2005 and $312,000 in 2004, when KMART filed for re-organization. KMART was current with the Company at the time that KMART filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January of 2002. The Company continued to supply KMART during its post petition re-organization and continues to supply the customer profitably today. The risk is that the Company derives most of the Companys sales revenue and profits from selling products to retailers for resale to consumers. The failure of the Companys customers to pay in full amounts due to the Company could negatively affect future profitability. COMPANY PROFITS CAN SUFFER FROM INTERRUPTIONS IN SUPPLY CHAIN The Company uses contract manufacturing facilities in Mainland China, Taiwan, and South Korea. These independent supplier entities are distant from the Company which means that the Company is at risk of business interruptions due to natural disaster, war, disease, and government intervention through tariffs or trade restrictions that are of less concern domestically. An additional area of concern for the Company is with the continuing War on Terror and the most recent developments in North Korea, Iran, and Lebanon. Three of our largest distributors outside the U.S. have already experienced a general tightening of the availability of credit in recent months, which 7 we believe to be partly a result of certain of these external concerns. Therefore, if there are any interruptions in the supply chain for any of these reasons, this could directly impact the Companys profits in a negative way. The Company is also at risk if trade restrictions are imposed on the Companys products based upon country of origin. In addition, any increase in tariffs and freight charges may not be acceptable to pass along to the Companys customers and could directly impact the Companys profits. FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD AFFECT PRICING OF PRODUCTS AND CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE LOWER-PRICED, LESS PROFITABLE PRODUCTS AND COULD AFFECT OVERALL DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS The Company receives a material portion of its revenue and profits from business in Canada and Europe. To the extent that value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to currencies in those jurisdictions, it increases the cost of the Companys products in those jurisdictions, which could create negative pressure on the overall demand for the Companys products. The Company gets paid from its international customers in U.S. dollars. To the extent that increased prices arising from currency fluctuations decrease the overall demand for the Companys products and the Companys sales or motivate customers to purchase lower-priced, lower profit products, the Companys revenues, profits, and cash flows could be adversely affected. COMPANY PROFITS CAN SUFFER FROM INCREASING MANUFACTURING COSTS IN CHINA AS A RESULT OF INCREASED WAGES AND WAGE TAXES The Company uses contract manufacturing facilities in Mainland China. An increase in the cost of labor or taxes on wages in China may lead to an increase in the cost of goods manufactured in China. The cost of labor and wage taxes have increased in China which means that the Company is at risk of higher manufacturing costs associated with goods manufactured in China. Additionally, in response to inflationary concerns, wages in certain provinces in China have recently increased and may continue to do so in the future. Significant increases in wages or wage taxes paid by contract manufacturing facilities may increase the cost of goods manufactured in China which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys profit margins and profitability. THE COMPANY USES THIRD PARTY CARRIERS TO SHIP OUR PRODUCTS WHICH MAY PASS ON INCREASES IN TRANSPORTAION-RELATED FUEL COST TO THE COMPANY WHICH CAN REDUCE PROFIT MARGINS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING PROFITABILITY The Company uses numerous third party carriers to ship product, both domestically and internationally. If the price of fuel continues to increase and the carriers choose to pass on these increase to the Company, our freight costs may increase. As a result, the Companys freight cost is impacted by changes in fuel prices. Fuel prices affect freight costs to both our customers location and our distribution center. Increase in fuel prices and surcharges and other factors have increased and may continue to increase freight costs in the future. This inflationary pressure of higher fuel costs and continued increase in transportation-related fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on the Companys profit margins and profitability. CONSISTENCY OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS WITH SEVERAL U.S. RETAILERS The Company is particularly concerned about the consistency of business with several U.S. retailers for the coming year. The recent tightening of credit availability worldwide caused all retailers to sharply curtail inventory increases in advance of this years holiday season. The Company has already seen some consolidation in product lines, and item elimination, or reductions at several big box retailers this past spring. The Company also recognizes the struggle that many of the Companys automobile customers have been reporting in the news, and the potential impact that a reduction in automobile unit sales might have upon our rear seat entertainment products for the automotive market in the coming fiscal year. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. None. 8 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. The Company leases its main plant and offices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from its Chairman, John C. Koss. On August 15, 2007, the lease was renewed for a period of five years, and is being accounted for as an operating lease. The lease extension maintained the rent at a fixed rate of $380,000 per year. At anytime during this period the Company has the option to renew the lease for an additional five years for the period commencing July 1, 2013 and ending June 30, 2018 under the same terms and conditions. The lease is on terms no less favorable to the Company than those that could be obtained from an independent party. The Company is responsible for all property maintenance, insurance, taxes, and other normal expenses related to ownership. All facilities are in good repair and, in the opinion of management, are suitable and adequate for the Companys business purposes. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. From time to time the Company is involved in routine litigation; however, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries are currently subject to any material legal proceedings in managements opinion. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS. No matters were submitted to a vote of stockholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. MARKET INFORMATION ON COMMON STOCK The Companys common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the trading symbol KOSS. There were approximately 550 record holders of the Companys common stock as of August 1, 2009. This number does not include individual participants in security position listings. The quarterly high and low sale prices of the Companys common stock for the last two fiscal years as well as dividends declared are shown below. Per Share Quarter Ended High Low Dividend September 30, 2007 $ 22.18 $ 18.58 $ 0.13 December 31, 2007 $ 20.39 $ 17.50 $ 1.13 March 31, 2008 $ 19.88 $ 16.69 $ 0.13 June 30, 2008 $ 17.94 $ 15.51 $ 0.13 September 30, 2008 $ 18.48 $ 13.52 $ 0.13 December 31, 2008 $ 16.00 $ 9.30 $ 0.13 March 31, 2009 $ 12.60 $ 9.35 $ 0.13 June 30, 2009 $ 15.78 $ 11.90 $ 0.13 The Companys stockholders are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors and paid out of funds legally available therefore. The Company began paying dividends for the quarter ended September 30, 2002 and has paid a dividend for each quarter since, including the last fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2009. On June 17, 2009, the Company announced its quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share for stockholders of record on June 30, 2009. The dividend was distributed on or around July 15, 2009. Although the Company anticipates it will continue to pay a quarterly dividend, the decision to pay dividends and the amount of such dividends are within the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, who meet quarterly. The decision to pay dividends will depend on the Companys operating results, financial condition, tax considerations, alternative uses for such funds, and other factors the Board of Directors deem relevant, and there can be no assurance that dividends will be paid in the future. 9 COMPANY REPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Period (2009) Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plan (1) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares Available under Repurchase Plan April 1-April 30 0 $ 0.00 0 $ 2,125,887 May 1-May 31 0 $ 0.00 0 $ 2,125,887 June 1-June 30 0 $ 0.00 0 $ 2,125,887 (1) In April of 1995, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase from time to time up to $2,000,000 of its common stock for its own account. Subsequently, the Board of Directors periodically has approved increases in the stock repurchase program. As of June 30, 2009, the most recently approved increase was for additional purchases of $2,000,000, which occurred in October of 2006, for an aggregate maximum of $45,500,000, of which $43,374,113 had been expended through June 30, 2009. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA. June 30, 2009 June 30, 2008 Net sales $ 38,184,150 $ 46,943,293 Net income $ 1,976,668 $ 4,494,289 Basic earnings per common share: Basic: $ 0.54 $ 1.22 Diluted: $ 0.54 $ 1.22 Total assets $ 28,470,352 $ 29,977,077 Cash dividends per common share $ 0.52 $ 1.52 See Part II, Item 7 - MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS and Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information relating to Selected Financial Data. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES During fiscal year 2009, cash provided by operations was $2,378,626, and during fiscal year 2008, cash provided by operations was $5,337,129. Working capital was $17,387,842 at June 30, 2009 and $18,547,574 at June 30, 2008. The net decrease in working capital of $1,159,732 from June 30, 2008 represents primarily the net change in cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Capital expenditures for new property and equipment (including production tooling) were $2,147,866 and $1,179,344, in fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. Depreciation charges totaled $817,957 and $961,605, for the same fiscal years. Budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal year 2010 are approximately $2,000,000. The Company expects to generate sufficient funds through operations to fund these expenditures. Stockholders investment increased to $23,630,392 at June 30, 2009 from $23,217,435 at June 30, 2008. The increase reflects the net effect of net income, dividends declared, purchase of common stock, exercise of stock options and compensation expense recorded for vested stock options granted under SFAS No. 123(R). On June 16, 2009, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share, for an aggregate of $479,876 payable on July 15, 2009 to stockholders of record on June 30, 2009, which is recorded as dividends payable. 10 On February 16, 2009, the Company entered into a new credit facility for an unsecured line of credit for up to a maximum of $10,000,000 up to and including January 29, 2010. This credit facility replaces the Companys previous credit facility, which has been terminated and contained substantially the same terms as the Companys new credit facility. The Companys credit facility matures on January 29, 2010. This unsecured credit facility provides for borrowings up to a maximum of $10,000,000. The Company can use this credit facility for working capital, to refinance existing indebtedness, for stock repurchase and for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at either the banks most recently publicly announced prime rate or at a LIBOR-based rate determined in accordance with the loan agreement. This credit facility includes certain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, liabilities to tangible net worth ratios and interest coverage ratios. The tangible net worth of the Company must not fall below $10.0 million at any time. The maximum leverage of the Company, which consists of the ratio of its consolidated liabilities to its consolidated tangible net worth, must not exceed 1.50 to 1.0. The interest coverage of the Company, which consists of the ratio of its earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other non-cash charges to its consolidated interest charges, must not be less than 2.00 to 1.0. The Company has been and is well within these requirements. The Company uses its credit facility from time to time, although there was no utilization of this credit facility at June 30, 2009 or June 30, 2008. In April of 1995, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase from time to time up to $2,000,000 of its common stock for its own account. Subsequently, the Board of Directors periodically has approved increases of between $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 in the stock repurchase program. As of June 30, 2009, the most recently approved increase was for additional purchases of $2,000,000, which occurred in October of 2006, for an aggregate maximum of $45,500,000, of which $43,374,113 had been expended through June 30, 2009. The Company intends to effect all stock purchases either on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, and intends to finance all stock purchases through its own cash flow or by borrowing for such purchases. The Company will continue to repurchase its shares from the market when the board determines the shares to be undervalued. The Company may elect to use the purchase of these shares to minimize the dilutive effects to its stockholders when the Companys stock is used in acquisitions as consideration. The Company has no immediate plans to make an acquisition at this time. For fiscal year 2009, the Company purchased 3,998 shares of its common stock at an average net price of $10.91 per share, for a total purchase price of $43,620. As of June 30, 2009 the Companys Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase by the Company of up to $2,000,000 in Company common stock at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. From the commencement of the Companys stock repurchase program through June 30, 2009, the Company has purchased a total of 5,474,102 shares for a total gross purchase price of $52,768,873 (representing an average gross purchase price of $9.64 per share) and a total net purchase price of $41,945,130 (representing an average net purchase price of $7.66 per share). The difference between the total gross purchase price and the total net purchase price is the result of the Company purchasing from certain employees shares of the Companys stock acquired by such employees pursuant to the Companys stock option program. In determining the dollar amount available for additional purchases under the stock repurchase program, the Company uses the total net purchase price paid by the Company for all stock purchases, as authorized by the Board of Directors. 2009 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED WITH 2008 Net sales for 2009 were $38,184,150 compared with $46,943,293 in 2008, a decrease of $8,759,143 or 19%. The sales decrease for the fiscal year is primarily due to soft retail sales in the United States and Europe. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was $13,267,137 or 35% in 2009 compared with $17,791,502 or 38% in 2008, this decrease is primarily due to softer retail sales worldwide and a less profitable product mix. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for 2009 were $10,653,243 compared with $10,792,064 in 2008. The Company has continued spending money on research and development of new products. The company spent approximately $1,948,000 on research and development during fiscal year 2009, as compared with $981,000 during fiscal year 2008. 11 Income from operations was $2,613,894 in 2009 compared with $6,999,438 in 2008, a decrease of $4,385,544 or 63%. This decrease was primarily due to spending on new product development, soft retail sales worldwide and a less profitable product mix. Interest income was $15,503 in 2009 compared with $119,464 in 2008, which was a decrease of 87%. Royalty income was $258,333 in 2009 compared with $291,667 in 2008, a decrease of 11%. The decrease in royalty income for the twelve month period was primarily a result of lower sales by the Companys primary licensee. The provision for income taxes was $911,062 and $2,916,280 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease is the provision for income taxes is attributable primarily to the decrease in income before income tax provision in 2009 compared to 2008. The Companys effective tax rate was 32% in 2009 and 39% in 2008. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases disclosed in Part I,
