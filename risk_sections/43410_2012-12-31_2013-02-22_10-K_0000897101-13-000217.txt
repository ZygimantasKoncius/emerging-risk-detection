Item 1A. RISK FACTORS – continued The loss of grantor trust status would have adverse tax consequences. Compliance with Section 646 of the Internal Revenue Code is integral to the level of distributions paid to the certificate holders. Should it be determined that we have violated the requirements of Section 646, the Trust would be taxed as a corporation versus a grantor trust. This would mean our income would be taxable upon our receipt and again upon receipt by the certificate holders. It is the Trustees’ opinion that the Trust has remained in compliance with the provisions of Section 646 since its election in 1988. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
