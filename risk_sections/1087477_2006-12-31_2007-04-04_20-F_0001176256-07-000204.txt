D. Risk Factors We are subject to significant risks and past performance is no guarantee of future performance. The following offers a brief overview of some of the risk factors to be considered in relation to our business. This list of factors may not be exhaustive, as we operate in a rapidly changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. We cannot predict such risk factors, nor can the impact, if any, be assessed of such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements or information. Accordingly, forward-looking statements or information should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. The following summarizes the major risks and uncertainties we face: We have a History of Losses For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $17.8 million and a net loss, after accounting for gains and income from discontinued operations, of $10.8 million. We have a history of losses, including a net loss from continuing operations of $16.5 million and a net loss of $12.8 million after accounting for income from discontinued operations, for the financial year ended 2005 and for the financial year ended 2004, we had a net loss from continuing operations of $12.2 million and a net loss of $8.0 million, after accounting for income from discontinued operations. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses during fiscal 2007 and that we will not reach profitability until further successful and profitable commercialization of one or more of our products. Even then, the initial losses incurred by u s may never be recovered. There can be no assurance that any of our recently launched products or products currently under development will be commercially successful. Need for Additional Funds As at December 31, 2006, we had a cumulative deficit of $89.6 million. We anticipate that it will be expending substantial funds in 2007 and beyond to fund research and development activities related to our products, to meet our financial obligations, and on general and administrative expenditures. Our future operations are dependent on our ability to obtain third party financing in the form of debt and/or equity and ultimately to generate future profitable operations. We are currently seeking additional funds through future debt or equity financing and joint venture partners to offset future cash flow deficiencies. Such financing may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms. The current market for financing is challenging and there can be no assurance that such additional funds will be available on acceptable terms or at all. We presently have no external sources of liquidity such as lines of credit, and the failure to obtain debt or equity financing on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms, may have negative effects on our cash flow and operations and our ability to continue our operations. Any additional equity financing, if secured, may result in significant dilution to the existing shareholders at the time of such additional financing. Our financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will continue in operation throughout 2007 and into the foreseeable future and will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recovery of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Dependence Upon a Few Customers and Products During the year ended December 31, 2006, we had phytosterol revenues of $6.1 million, including $6.0 million in sales and $0.1 million in licensing revenues. Most of our revenue was earned from sales of phytosterols to a few customers. We anticipate that we will be dependent on a few customers for most of our revenues for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2007. Any material change in the relationship with such customers or in the demand for our phytosterol products will have a material effect on our business and results of operations. Our contract for the sale of ReducolTM to Pharmavite will end in June, 2007, and is subject to automatic one-year renewals unless either party provides 90 days prior written notice of its intention not to renew. Failure to renew or otherwise extend this contract will have a material adverse effec t on our product sales and revenue. 5 Additional Research and Development is Required Before We Can Commercialize Additional Products or Market Existing Products into Other Countries To achieve sustained, profitable operations, we must successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for, and profitably manufacture and market one or more of our products. Our products require extensive levels of research and development. We have spent approximately $9.6 million, $11.0 million, and $5.6 million on research and development efforts during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Since our inception, we have been engaged primarily in research and development. Although in the last year our revenues have increased and we believe that our phytosterols may be incorporated into a wide variety of food, beverages, dietary supplements and medicines, clinical studies proving the efficacy of our phytosterols in a wide variety of foods and beverages, in dietary supplements or as pharmaceutical products have not yet been completed, and stable and effective formulations have not yet been adequately tested or developed on a commercial scale. In addition, further research may be required by regulatory authorities in certain countries prior to permitting phytosterol products to be sold in those countries, whether in food or beverages or as dietary supplements, and further extensive research will be required prior to any sale of a pharmaceutical product. Accordingly, we may be required to condu ct additional developmental activities on these products, and certain of our proposed products will require substantial additional research and development, including extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing, before we will be able to obtain the approvals of the FDA, Health Canada, and similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Development of New Products The development of new products is subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties. Potential products that appear to be promising in various stages of development, including many of the products currently being developed by us, may not reach the market for a number of reasons. Such reasons include the possibilities that the potential product will be found ineffective or unduly toxic during preclinical or clinical trials, failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals, be difficult or uneconomic to manufacture on a large scale, be uneconomical to market, not achieve market acceptance, or be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties. Certain of our products under development have never been manufactured on a commercial scale, and there can be no assurance that such products can be manufactured at a cost or in a quantity to render such products commercially viable. Production of our products may require the development of new manufacturing technologies and expertise. The impact on our business in the event that new manufacturing technologies and expertise are required to be developed is uncertain. There can be no assurance that we will successfully meet any of these technological challenges, or others that may arise in the course of development. Risks Inherent in Nutraceutical and Pharmaceutical Research Pharmaceutical and nutraceutical research and development is highly speculative and involves a significant degree of risk. The marketability of any product developed by us will be affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including: - the discovery of unexpected toxicities or lack of sufficient efficacy of products which make them unattractive or unsuitable for human use; - preliminary results as seen in animal and/or limited human testing may not be substantiated in larger controlled clinical trials; - manufacturing costs or other factors may make manufacturing of products impractical and non-competitive; - proprietary rights of third parties or competing products or technologies may preclude commercialization; - requisite regulatory approvals for the commercial distribution of products may not be obtained; and - other factors may become apparent during the course of research, up-scaling or manufacturing which may result in the discontinuation of research and other critical projects. 6 Risks Related to Clinical Trials We must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that our product is safe and efficacious before we can obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of such products for certain commercial applications. The results from preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be totally predictive of results obtained in larger clinical trials, and there can be no assurance that any of our clinical trials or any of our collaborators will demonstrate safety and efficacy, achieve regulatory approvals or result in marketable products. A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after achieving promising results in earlier trials. Failure to complete clinical trials successfully and on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our future business. Results of the US Phase II clinical trial for our innovative compound, FM-VP4, were released in late 2006. They illustrated that while the compound was proven to have an excellent safety profile, reduced LDL cholesterol by 9% at the 900 mg level and demonstrated a dose response, it did not perform to our expectation. We experienced a material adverse effect on our market capital and share price as a result, and various measures were taken to decrease costs, including a corporate re-structuring. Risks Related to Strategic Relationships Part of our strategy is to enter into arrangements with third parties from time to time related to the development, clinical testing, up-scaling, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of our products. Such relationships may enable us to market our products to new markets, generate additional revenue and develop and commercialize new products. Entering into strategic relationships is complicated and the interests of our strategic partners may not be or remain consistent with our interests. Some of our current and future strategic partners may decide to compete with us, refuse to fulfill or honor their contractual obligations to us, or change their strategic plans to reduce their commitment to, or even abandon, their relationships with us. To the extent we enter into product out-licensing arrangements for the marketing or distribution of our products with coll aborative partners, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties. There can be no assurance that any third party will market our products successfully or that any third-party collaboration will be on favorable terms. We may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources our strategic partners devote to our products. The agreements may be terminated or altered by our strategic partners in certain circumstances. If any marketing partner does not market a product successfully, our business might be materially and adversely affected. One of the key strategic relationships we are currently seeking is an out-licensing opportunity for FM-VP4 based on our clinically significant results, dose responsiveness, and excellent safety profile. There is no guarantee that such a relationship will be achieved, or that significant revenue will be generated should such a relationship be achieved. We are also currently dependent for the majority of our ReducolTM sterol supply on performance by Phyto-Source. Any disruption to this important strategic relationship may materially and adversely affect us. Risks Associated with Our Intellectual Property Rights Our success is dependent not only on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, but also upon the protection of rights of third parties from which we have licensed intellectual property rights. We hold, directly or indirectly, rights to various patents and trade marks and rights to various pending patent and trade mark applications in Canada, the United States, and other jurisdictions. In addition, we rely upon certain other technologies, ideas, know-how, secrets or other information, which we may not be able to protect. Notwithstanding precautions we may take to protect our rights, third parties may copy or obtain and use our proprietary and licensed technologies, ideas, know-how, secrets and other proprietary information without authorization or independently develop technologies similar or superior to our proprietary and licensed technologies. We enter into confidentiality and restriction on use agreements with our employees, strategic partners and others; however, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary and licensed technologies or other intellectual property in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. Policing unauthorized use of such technologies and intellectual property is extremely difficult, and the cost of enforcing our rights through litigation may be prohibitive. Further, the laws of jurisdictions other than Canada and the United States may not provide meaningful protection of our and such third parties intellectual property rights. 7 No Assurance Regarding Licensing of Proprietary Technology Owned by Others The manufacture and sale of any products we have developed may involve the use of proprietary processes, products or information, which are owned by third parties. Although we have obtained licenses or rights with regard to the use of certain of such processes, products and information as best we can, there is no assurance that such licenses or rights will not be terminated or expire during critical periods, that we will be able to obtain licenses or other rights which may be important to us, or, if obtained, that such licenses will be obtained on favorable terms. Some of these licenses provide for limited periods of exclusivity that may be extended only with the consent of the licensor. There is no assurance that extensions will be granted on any or all such licenses. This same restriction may be contained in licenses obtained in the future. To maintain these agreements in good standing, we must abide by the terms of such agreements, and the loss of any of such agreements due to default could have a materially adverse impact on our operations. There are no assurances that we will be able to renew or renegotiate the licensing agreements on acceptable terms if and when the agreements terminate. Risks Associated with Our Patents Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain, enforce and maintain patent protection for our technology in Canada, the United States and other countries. (See Item 4B  Business Overview  Intellectual Property.) We cannot be assured that patents will issue from any pending applications or that claims now or in the future, if any, allowed under issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide continuing competitive advantages to us. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, including us, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, it is not known whether any of our current research endeavors will result in the issuance of patents in Canada, the United States, or elsewhere, or if any patents already issued will provide significant proprietary protection or will be circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, we cannot be certain that we or any licensor was the first to create inventions claimed by pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Loss of patent protection could lead to generic competition for these products, and others in the future, which would materially and adversely affect the financial prospects for these products and us. There is no assurance that our patents, if issued, would be held valid or enforceable by a court or that a competitors technology or product would be found to infringe such patents. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain and enforce effective patents to protect our proprietary rights from use by competitors, and the patents of other parties could require us to stop using or pay to use certain intellectual property, and as such, our competitive position and profitability could suffer as a result. Risks Associated with Claims of Infringement of Proprietary Rights of Others The functional food and pharmaceutical industries have experienced substantial litigation involving the manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting proprietary rights. As a result, there is a substantial risk that we, or one or more of our licensors, may become subject to litigation alleging that our or such licensors products and technologies infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. Whether or not our or such licensors products or technologies infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, we or such licensors could incur significant expenses in defending allegations of infringement of proprietary rights. Further, we or such licensors may be required to modify their products or obtain licenses for intellectual property rights as a result of any alleged proprietary inf ringement. We or such licensors may not be able to modify their products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, in a timely manner, or at all, any of which could adversely affect our business. 8 Third Party Payors/Government Controls Any revenues we may receive from future sales of pharmaceutical products will depend in part on reimbursement policies and regulations of government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. The business and financial condition of pharmaceutical companies will continue to be affected by the efforts of governments and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means. For example, in certain markets, including Canada, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. In the United States there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed health care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or the effects of such proposals or managed care efforts may have on our business, the announcement and/or adoption of such proposals or efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and that of our prospective corporate partners. Accordingly, our ability to establish strategic alliances may be adversely affected. In addition, in Canada, the United States and elsewhere, sales of prescription pharmaceutical products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. To the extent we succeed in bringing new products to market, there can be no assurance that these products will be considered cost-effective and reimbursement to consumers will be available or will be sufficient to allow the sale of these products on a competitive basis. We may not be able to obtain prices for our products under development that will make them commercially viable. Risk of Technical Obsolescence The pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries are characterized by rapidly changing markets, technology, emerging industry standards and frequent introduction of new products. The introduction of new products embodying new technologies, including new manufacturing processes, and the emergence of new industry standards may render our products obsolete, less competitive or less marketable. The process of developing our products is extremely complex and requires significant continuing development efforts and third party commitments. Our failure to develop new technologies and products and the obsolescence of existing technologies could adversely affect our business. Because the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries are characterized by rapid technology change and obsolescence, we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential customer requirements that could make our existing technology obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and services, develop new technology that addresses the increasing sophistication and varied needs of our current and future customers, license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of our proprietary technology and investing in certain niche markets entails significant technical and business risks. We may not be successful in using our new technologies or exploiting our niche markets effectively or adapting our businesses to evolving customer or medical requirements or preferences or emerging industry standards. Competition The markets for products based on our technology are intensely competitive and, as a result, we face competition from several different sources, including nutraceutical companies, food companies, pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other related institutions. In the pharmaceutical market, we compete with Bayer, Merck & Co., Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Lilly, Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca AB and others. In the functional foods market, our products will compete with the products of, among others, Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, Cargill Incorporated, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cognis and Raisio Staest Oy. These companies are more established, benefit from greater name recognition and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience in undertaking research, preclinical studies and human clinical studies and trials of new pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing such products. In addition, there are several other companies and products with which we may compete from time to time, and which may have si gnificantly better and larger resources than us. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in commercializing products more rapidly or effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 9 We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. There can be no assurance that existing products or new products developed by our competitors will not be more effective, or be more effectively marketed and sold, than any that may be developed or sold by us. Competitive products may render our products obsolete and uncompetitive prior to recovering research, development or commercialization expenses incurred with respect to any such products. Risk of Market Acceptance There can be no assurance that any of our products in development or products recently launched will achieve market acceptance. Further, there can be no assurance that products launched by third parties containing ReducolTM or any of our phytosterols will achieve sustained market acceptance. The degree of market acceptance for our products will depend upon a number of factors, including competitive pricing, the extent to which the products fulfill customers expectations and demands, the receipt of regulatory approvals, the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of the products, the establishment and demonstration of the potential advantages over competing products and, in the case of pharmaceuticals, the establishment and demonstration of the potential advantages over existing and new treatment methods and the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors, and in the case of our nutraceuticals, the acceptance of the listing of the product and appropriate distribution with large retailers. There can be no assurance that consumers, physicians, patients, payors or the medical community in general will accept and utilize any existing or new products that may be developed by us. Need for Growth We intend to grow our business over the next few years. There is no assurance that our employees, systems, procedures, controls, and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of our operations. Our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers, key employees and manufacturing partners to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve technical, administrative, financial control, reporting systems and operational excellence in order to achieve established business objectives. We may not be able to expand and upgrade our facilities and supporting systems and infrastructure to accommodate increased business. Difficulties in managing any future growth could have a significant negative impact on our business because we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet customers requirements. Future Revenues and Profitability are Uncertain Our financial results may fluctuate, and our future revenue and profitability are uncertain. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability in the foreseeable future depends on the commercial success of our products. Because we are and will be in the process of launching new products in new markets, revenues are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from period to period. In addition, product development programs will require substantial additional investment, including the cost of pre-clinical and clinical trials, obtaining additional regulatory approvals, if necessary, and marketing and sales expenses associated with potential new product introductions. The research, development, production and marketing of new products will require the application of considerable technical and financial resources by us and our collaborators, while revenues that are generated by such products, if successfully developed and marketed, may not be realized for several years. We may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. Our future revenue is also dependent upon fulfillment of contractual obligations by third parties, including fulfilling payment terms and meeting forecasted purchase requirements by buyers of our products and assets. 10 Dependence upon Key Personnel Our ability to develop marketable products and to maintain a competitive position in light of technological developments will also depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific and management personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. If we lose the services of key personnel, it may be unable to replace them, and our business could be negatively affected. Government Regulation Generally Some products manufactured by us will have to comply with the FDAs current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and other FDA, Health Canada and local government guidelines and regulations, including other international regulatory requirements and guidelines. Additionally, certain of our customers may require the manufacturing facilities contracted by us to adhere to additional manufacturing standards, even if not required by the FDA. Compliance with cGMP regulations requires manufacturers to expend time, money and effort in production, and to maintain precise records and quality control to ensure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. The FDA and other regulatory bodies periodically inspect drug-manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with applicable cGMP requirements. If the manufacturing facilities contracted by us fail to comply with the cGMP requirements, the facilities may become subject to possible FDA or other regulatory action and manufacturing at the facility could consequently be suspended. We may not be able to contract suitable alternative or back-up manufacturing facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all. The FDA or other regulatory agencies may also require the submission of any lot of a particular product for inspection. If the lot product fails to meet the FDA requirements, then the FDA could take any of the following actions: (i) restrict the release of the product; (ii) suspend manufacturing of the specific lot of the product; (iii) order a recall of the lot of the product; or (iv) order a seizure of the lot of the product. We are subject to regulation by governments in many jurisdictions and, if we do not comply with food, healthcare, drug, manufacturing and environmental regulations, among others, our existing and future operations may be curtailed, and we could be subject to liability. In addition to the regulatory approval process, we may be subject to regulations under local, provincial, state, federal and foreign law, including requirements regarding occupational health safety, laboratory practices, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, and may be subject to other present and future local, provincial, state, federal and foreign regulations, including possible future regulations of the food ingredient, dietary supplement and pharmaceutical industries. We cannot predict the time required for regulatory approval, or the extent of clinical testing and documentation that may be required by regulatory authorities. We may not be able to obtain the approval of regulatory authorities in any country to market our products, or if obtained, that the approval will be given in a timely manner or that such approval will not later be revoked. Any delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, Canada or other countries would significantly delay or prevent the development of our markets and products and would therefore adversely and severely affect our business. Government Regulation of Functional Foods The regulatory process for the approval of functional foods in a number of countries is currently in a state of uncertainty, which may negatively impact the marketing of our phytosterol products. For example, prior to June, 2001, Australia had no regulations governing functional foods. However, in June of 2001, the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) regulations governing novel foods, including foods containing plant sterols, came into force with the result that previously unregulated novel foods, including products enriched with Reducol™, were voluntarily withdrawn from the market pending regulatory approval. 11 Health Canada has classified all phytosterol products, which would include sterol esters, stanol esters and free sterols, as drugs. As such, we are prohibited from marketing our phytosterols in Canada until regulatory approval from Health Canada is obtained. Additionally, the division which oversees food products has currently taken the position that no nutrients naturally present in foods can be enhanced in concentration to form functional foods. In the United States, our phytosterols are currently permitted to be included in food or as dietary supplements and the FDA has issued a letter to us allowing it to use a heart-health claim for our phytosterols. There can be no assurance that the current regulations will not be modified or that such modifications will not have an adverse effect on the ability of us to continue to distribute or advertise such products in the United States with the heart-health claim for our phytosterols. In the EU, we have received approval to market Reducol™ in a variety of approved food groups (See Item 4B “Business Overview” – “Our Nutraceuticals” - “Reducol™ and Functional Foods”). There can be no assurance that such approval will not be modified in a manner adverse to our business, or will not be revoked in its entirety. Government Regulation of Pharmaceuticals The regulatory process for pharmaceuticals, which includes preclinical studies and clinical trials of each compound to establish its safety and efficacy, takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Moreover, if regulatory approval of a drug is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in suspension of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. Further, government policy may change, and additional government regulations may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approvals for our products. In addition, a marketed drug and its manufacturer are subject to continual review. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with the pro duct or manufacturer may result in restrictions on such product or manufacturer, including withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA in the United States and Health Canada in Canada may deny approval of a NDA or NDS if required regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. The FDA and Health Canada may require further testing and surveillance programs to monitor the pharmaceutical product that has been commercialized. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines and other judicially imposed sanctions, including product withdrawals, product seizures, injunction actions and criminal prosecutions. In addition to our own pharmaceuticals, we expect to supply many active pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced pharmaceutical intermediates for use in our customers drug products. The final drug products in which the pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced pharmaceutical intermediates are used, however, are subject to regulation for safety and efficacy by the FDA, Health Canada and other jurisdictions, as the case may be. Such products must be approved by such agencies before they can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining regulatory clearance for marketing is uncertain, costly and time consuming. We cannot predict how long the necessary regulatory approvals will take or whether our customers will ever obtain such approval for their products. To the extent that our customers do not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for marketing new products, our product sales could be adversely affected. 12 Health Canada, the FDA and other governmental regulators have increased requirements for drug purity and have increased environmental burdens upon the pharmaceutical industry. Because pharmaceutical drug manufacturing is a highly regulated industry, requiring significant documentation and validation of manufacturing processes and quality control assurance prior to approval of the facility to manufacture a specific drug, there can be considerable transition time between the initiation of a contract to manufacture a product and the actual initiation of manufacture of that product. Any lag time in the initiation of a contract to manufacture product and the actual initiation of manufacture could cause us to lose profits or incur liabilities. The pharmaceutical regulatory regime in Europe and other countries is, by and large, generally similar to that of Canada and the United States. We could face similar risks in these other jurisdictions, as the risks described above. Restrictions on Product Labeling and Advertising The FDA, which regulates product labeling, has issued a letter allowing us to use a heart-health claim for its phytosterol products. There can be no assurance that the FDA will not revoke the permission granted to us to make the claim. Regulatory agencies in Europe and other countries may regulate claims made regarding functional foods and their efficacy. Similarly, the United States Federal Trade Commission and its counterparts in other countries may place restrictions on our ability to make claims regarding the efficacy of its products in advertising. Restrictions on product claims may impede our efforts to gain general market acceptance for its products at a premium price, which would adversely affect our business. Currently, the pricing of functional foods generally exceeds the pricing of similar conventional foods, and clinical claims are necessary to ma intain the competitive position of functional foods. Product Liability, Negative Publicity and Insurance The sale of our phytosterol products, the use of any of our unapproved products under development, the use of our products in clinical trials, including FM-VP4 and, if regulatory approval is received, the sale of such products, may expose us to liability claims which could adversely affect us. Such claims might be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers or by pharmaceutical companies or others selling or consuming such products. We currently have general liability and office contents insurance. This insurance may not cover any potential claim or if coverage is available, may not provide sufficient coverage to protect us against loss. We may not be able to maintain or obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for future products, and any claims under any insurance policies may adversely affect our ability to maintain ex isting policies or to obtain new insurance on existing or future products. Further, even if sufficient insurance coverage is available to cover any potential claim, publicity associated with any such claim could adversely affect public opinion regarding the safety or efficacy of our products. As a result, any product liability claim or recall could seriously adversely affect our business. Risks Relating to Supply and Sale of Raw Materials We rely on the availability of raw materials, such as phytosterols, at commercially reasonable prices for the production and development of our sterol-based products and technology. We may not be able to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely fashion or at acceptable quality, quantity, timing or prices to satisfy our complete long-term requirements. Our inability to obtain raw materials at acceptable qualities, quantities, timing or prices would adversely affect our business. Manufacturing Risks We rely substantially for our success on our ability to either manufacture or secure third party manufacture of our products. In the case of phytosterols, we currently rely on Phyto-Source for commercial manufacturing. The Phyto-Source manufacturing facility is operated by Chusei. We have relied and will continue to rely heavily on contract manufacturers for the production of product required for our clinical studies, product formulation work, up-scaling experiments, and commercial production. We may not be able to obtain contract manufacturers to produce a sufficient quantity or quality of our products to conduct our clinical studies, product formulation work, up-scaling experiments and commercial production. Even if we are successful in securing manufacture of sufficient products for our clinical trials, product formulation work, up-scaling experiments and commercial production, we expect to rely on the efforts of contract manufacturers, including Phyto-Source, and third-party manufacturers to produce our products. Contract manufacturers may not be available or, if obtained, may not be reliable in meeting our requirements for cost, quality, quantity or schedule, or the requirements of any regulatory agencies. Any such failure would adversely affect our business. 13 Factors beyond our control could cause interruption in operations at the Phyto-Source manufacturing facilities, or at other contract manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our ability to supply our customers and in turn could adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace and our business. These facilities could suffer an interruption caused by damage from a variety of sources, many of which are not within our control or our contract manufacturers, including, fire, flood and other natural disasters, power loss and telecommunication failure, software and hardware errors, failures or crashes and similar disruptions. Any significant interruptions in operations could interrupt our ability to supply our customers, which in turn could subject us to lawsuits, damage our reputation in the marketplace and have a negative impact on our business. Risk of Side Effects Currently, there are no regulations in the United States, or in many other countries in which we currently intend to market our phytosterol products, used as functional foods and dietary supplements, which limit the total amount of such products a person may consume in any particular period. In addition, the amounts of phytosterols which have been studied in clinical trials to date has been limited. As a consequence, there is a risk that an individual could consume, through functional foods and dietary supplements, large quantities of phytosterols, and as a result, experience side effects yet to be determined. We could face future liability for unknown side effects and any such liability could exceed our resources. Political and Economic Risks We rely in part on third parties located in the United States and other foreign countries for the development and manufacture of our products. The current political and economic climate in these countries may be considered less predictable than in Canada and the United States. Changes in government, economic and political policies may adversely affect our business and operating results. Environmental Risks Research, development and commercial processes involve use of materials which may result in by-products that may be hazardous. The Company, our strategic partners, distributors, manufacturers, sales agents and others involved in handling materials are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products. There is a risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials which cannot be eliminated. We could be liable for any resulting damages and any such liability could exceed our resources. We may also be required to obtain permits to transport and dispose of hazardous waste under applicable environmental laws. We may not be able to obtain such permits, which would adversely affect its ability to efficiently manufacture or transport its products. We, our strategic partners, distributors, sales agent s, manufacturers and others involved in handling materials may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future or to remediate environmental violations. We may be adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations. Any failure by us to comply with the present or future environmental laws in Canada and the United States, or elsewhere, could result in any of the following: (i) cessation of portions or all of our operations; (ii) imposition of fines; (iii) restrictions on the ability of us to carry on or expand operations; (iv) significant expenditures by us in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations; or (v) liabilities in excess of our resources. Any of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to dispose of our waste products in a cost effective or timely manner, or at all. Volatility of Stock Price/Liquidity of Shares The market prices for the securities of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, have historically been highly volatile, and the market has, from time to time, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Factors such as fluctuations in our operating results, announcements of competing technological innovations or new therapeutic products by our competitors, clinical trial results, governmental regulation, developments in patent or other proprietary rights, public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us or others and general market conditions, delay in achieving or failure to achieve previously announced milestones or Company goals, can have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares. In particular, the realization of any of the risks described herein coul d have a material adverse impact on such market price. Sales of substantial amounts of our shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales will occur, could also adversely affect the market price of our shares and make it more difficult in the future for us to raise funds through equity offerings. As a result of the volatility of our stock price, there is no assurance that we will continue to meet the minimum listing requirements on the NASDAQ Global Market, The Toronto Stock Exchange, or any other securities market on which our shares may be listed from time to time. De-listing of us or our shares from any securities exchange could have a negative effect on the liquidity of our shares and/or the ability of a shareholder to trade in shares of the Company. 14 Our common share price has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Stock Exchange Minimum Listing Requirements Our Common Shares are currently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ Global Market. We do not currently meet NASDAQs minimum US$1.00 bid price requirement for continued inclusion on the NASDAQ Global market and have until July 23, 2007 to regain compliance with this requirement. There is no assurance that we will continue to meet the minimum listing requirements of either the NASDAQ Global Market or the Toronto Stock Exchange. If we do not continue to meet the minimum requirements of the relevant exchange, our shares may be de-listed from such exchange. De-listing of the Company or our shares from any securities exchange could have a negative effect on the liquidity of our shares and/or the ability of a shareholder to trade in shares of the Company. No Dividends We have not paid any cash dividends on our Common Shares and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. We plan to retain any earnings for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth. Anti-Takeover Provisions On February 9, 1998, our board of directors (the Board of Directors) adopted a shareholder rights plan which was amended and restated by our board of directors on April 28, 2003 (the Rights Plan). The Rights Plan was adopted by our shareholders at our Annual General Meeting on May 29, 2003. The Rights Plan was adopted in part to discourage takeover attempts that may not be in the best interests of our shareholders. The Rights Plan is designed to give the Board of Directors of the Company time to pursue other alternatives to maximize shareholder value in the event of an unsolicited takeover offer for the Company. The effect of the Rights Plan could be to discourage a third party from attempting to acquire, or make it more difficult to acquire, control of the Company without first negotiating with our Board of Directors. The Rights Plan could also limit the price tha t certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for Common Shares. Foreign Currency and Exchange Our functional currency is the Canadian dollar. We operate and intend to continue operating in several foreign markets. As such, cash flows from such foreign operations will be subject to fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate of the applicable currency. Conflicts Certain of the Directors and Officers of the Company also serve as directors and officers of, or have significant shareholdings or other ownership interests in, other companies involved in the biotechnology industry or which may be involved in transactions with the Company or which may provide professional services to the Company. Consequently there exists the possibility for such Directors and Officers to be in a position of conflict. (See Item 6A, Directors, Senior Management and Employees  Directors and Senior Management - Principal Business Activities Performed Outside the Company) Risks Related to Material Contractual Obligations We have obligations under a number of contracts, and failure to meet our obligations under any of our material contracts may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. In particular, but without limitation, the failure of us to meet our obligations under the TheraPei Development Agreement and Plan and Reorganization, the Pharmavite License & Supply Agreement, the Phyto-Source Supply Agreement (and amendments thereto), and the Forbes-Fayrefield Joint Venture Agreement may adversely affect our assets and business. (See Item 10C, Additional Information  Material Contracts). Alternatively, failure on the part of the other party to each material contract to meet their respective obligations may also adversely affect our operations and finances. There exists the possibility that an y or all of our material contracts may be renegotiated, amended, terminated, or not renewed, and there is no guarantee that such action will be favorable to us. 15 Risks Related to Legal Proceedings Any costs associated with legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, attorney fees, filing fees, and damages, may adversely affect our assets and business, whether the outcome of the proceedings is favorable to us or not. (See Item 8A - Legal Matters  Lawsuit.) Directors and Officers Indemnity We have entered into agreements pursuant to which we will indemnify our directors and officers in respect of certain claims made against them while acting in their capacity as such. If we are called upon to perform our indemnity obligations, our finances will be adversely affected.
