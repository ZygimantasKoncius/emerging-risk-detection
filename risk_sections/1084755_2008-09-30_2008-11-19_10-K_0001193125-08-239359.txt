ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Ariba and our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. We Compete in New and Rapidly Evolving Markets, and Our Spend Management Solutions Are At a Relatively Early Stage of Development. These Factors Make Evaluation of Our Future Prospects Difficult. Spend management software applications and services are at a relatively early stage of development. For example, in September 2001, we introduced the majority of our initial Ariba Spend Management solutions and after our merger with FreeMarkets in 2004, we introduced several new products and services integrating functionality acquired in the merger. We also introduced on-demand versions of a number of our software products throughout fiscal year 2006, fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2008 and we plan to introduce additional on-demand versions of our products in the future. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. As we adjust to evolving customer requirements and competitive pressures, we may be required to further reposition our product and service offerings and introduce new products and services. We may not be successful in developing and marketing such product and service offerings, or we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the development and marketing of such product and service offerings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Deteriorating Economic Conditions May Adversely Impact Our Business. Our business may be adversely affected by the ongoing credit crises and deteriorating worldwide economic conditions. Although our spend management solutions help companies reduce the costs of their goods and services and may therefore be perceived as even more strategic during adverse economic conditions, a weakening global economy, or decline in confidence in the economy, could adversely impact our business in a number of important respects. These include (i) reduced bookings and revenues, as a result of longer sales cycles, reduced, deferred or cancelled customer purchases and lower average selling prices; (ii) increased operating losses and reduced cash flows from operations; (iii) greater than anticipated uncollectible accounts receivables and increased allowances for doubtful accounts receivable; (iv) impairment in the value of our financial and non-financial assets resulting in non-cash impairment charges; and (vi) reduced cash inflows and increased restructuring charges to the extent that actual sublease income from abandoned facilities is lower than currently estimated income. We May Fail to Achieve Our Financial Forecasts Due to Inaccurate Sales Forecasts and Other Factors. Our revenues are difficult to predict and, as a result, our quarterly financial results can fluctuate substantially. We estimate quarterly revenues in part based on our sales pipeline, which is an estimate of potential customers, their stage of the sales process, the potential amount of their sales contracts and the likelihood that we will convert them into actual customers during the quarter. To the extent that any of these estimates are inaccurate, our actual revenues may be different than our forecast revenues. Our Business Is Susceptible to Numerous Risks Associated with International Operations. International operations have represented a significant portion of our revenues over the past three years. We have committed and expect to continue to commit significant resources to our international sales and marketing activities. We are subject to a number of risks associated with these activities. These risks generally include:  currency exchange rate fluctuations;  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; 14  tariffs, export controls and other trade barriers;  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;  difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;  potentially adverse foreign tax consequences, including withholding in connection with the repatriation of earnings;  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws; and  political instability. For international sales and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies, we are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations. Since the majority of our non-U.S. sales are priced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, a strengthening of the dollar may reduce the level of reported revenues. If such events continue to occur, our net revenues could be seriously impacted, since a significant portion of our net revenues are derived from international operations. We have partially hedged risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings. We utilize forward contracts to hedge trade and intercompany receivables and payables. There can be no assurance that our hedging strategy will be successful or that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our Success Depends on Market Acceptance of Standalone Spend Management Solutions. Our success depends on widespread customer acceptance of standalone spend management solutions from vendors like us, rather than solutions from ERP software vendors and others that are part of a broader enterprise application solution. For example, ERP vendors, such as Oracle and SAP, could bundle spend management modules with their existing applications and offer these modules at little or no cost. If our products and services do not achieve continued customer acceptance, our business will be seriously harmed. We Have a History of Losses and May Incur Significant Additional Losses in the Future. We have a significant accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2008, resulting in large part from cumulative charges for the amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including those discussed in other risk factors and the following:  adverse economic conditions;  the failure of our standalone spend management solutions business to mature as a separate market category;  declines in average selling prices of our products and services resulting from adverse economic conditions, competition or the introduction of newer products that generally have lower list prices than our more established products and other factors;  failure to successfully grow our sales channels;  failure to maintain control over costs;  increased restructuring charges resulting from the failure to sublease excess facilities at anticipated levels and rates;  charges incurred in connection with any future restructurings or acquisitions; and  impairment charges as a result of the decline in value and credit quality of our investments in auction rate securities (ARS). 15 Our Quarterly Operating Results Are Volatile, Difficult to Predict and May Be Unreliable as Indicators of Future Performance Trends. Our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely continue to vary significantly in the future. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance. In addition, we may fail to achieve forecasts of quarterly and annual revenues and operating results. Our quarterly operating results have varied or may vary depending on a number of factors, including the following: Risks Related to Revenues:  fluctuations in demand, sales cycles and average selling price for our products and services;  reductions in customers budgets for information technology purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles;  fluctuations in the number of relatively larger orders for our products and services;  increased dependence on relatively smaller orders from a larger number of customers;  dependence on generating revenues from new revenue sources;  delays in recognizing revenue from multiple element arrangements;  ability to renew ratable revenue streams, including subscription software, software maintenance and subscription services, without substantial declines from prior arrangements; and,  changes in the mix of types of customer agreements and related timing of revenue recognition. Risks Related to Expenses:  our overall ability to control costs, including managing reductions in expense levels through restructuring and severance payments;  the level of expenditures relating to ongoing legal proceedings;  costs associated with changes in our pricing policies and business model;  costs associated with the amortization of stock-based compensation expense; and  the failure to adjust our workforce to changes in the level of our operations. Our On-Demand Strategy Carries a Number of Risks Which May Be Harmful to Our Business. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our on-demand applications. We have experienced and may continue to experience a deferral of revenues and cash payments from customers. Additional risks with the on-demand model include the following:  as a result of increased demands on our engineering organization to develop multi-tenant versions of our products while supporting and enhancing our existing products, we may not introduce multi-tenant versions of our products or enhancements to our products on a timely and cost-effective basis or at appropriate quality levels;  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience a decrease in the demand for our implementation services to the extent fewer customers license our software products as installed applications;  we may not successfully achieve market penetration in our newly targeted markets, including target customers we characterize as middle-market companies; and  we may incur costs at a higher than forecasted rate as we expand our on-demand operations. 16 We Are Currently Implementing a New Enterprise Resource Planning System, and Problems With the Design or Implementation of This System Could Interfere With Our Business and Operations. We have commenced a project to implement a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of the ERP system, which may be disruptive to our underlying business. Any disruptions or delays in the design and implementation of the new ERP system, particularly any disruptions or delays that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, file SEC reports in a timely manner and otherwise run our business. Further, as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if our database infrastructure does not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Even if we do encounter these adverse effects, the design and implementation of the new ERP system may be much more costly than we anticipated. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Our Business Could Be Seriously Harmed If We Fail to Retain Our Key Personnel. Our future performance depends on the continued service of our senior management, product development and sales personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of these personnel could seriously harm our business. Our ability to retain key employees may be harder given that we have substantial operations in several geographic regions, including Sunnyvale, California, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Atlanta, Georgia and Bangalore, India. In addition, uncertainty created by turnover of key employees could result in reduced confidence in our financial performance which could cause fluctuations in our stock price and result in further turnover of our employees. Our Revenues In Any Quarter May Fluctuate Significantly Because Our Sales Cycles Can Be Long and Unpredictable. Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable. The purchase of our products is often discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources by a customer. It frequently takes several months to finalize a sale and requires approval at a number of management levels within the customer organization. The implementation and deployment of our products requires a significant commitment of resources by our customers and third parties and/or professional services organizations. As a result of the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle, our revenues in any quarter may fluctuate significantly. Revenues in Any Quarter May Vary to the Extent Recognition of Revenue Is Deferred When Contracts Are Signed. As a Result, Revenues in Any Quarter May Be Difficult to Predict and Are an Unreliable Indicator of Future Performance Trends. We frequently enter into contracts where we recognize only a portion of the total revenue under the contract in the quarter in which we enter into the contract. For example, we may recognize revenue on a ratable basis over the life of the contract or enter into contracts where the recognition of revenue is conditioned upon delivery of future product or service elements. The portion of revenues recognized on a deferred basis may vary significantly in any given quarter, and revenues in any given quarter are a function both of contracts signed in such quarter and contracts signed in prior quarters. Revenues From Our Ariba Sourcing Solution Could Be Negatively Affected If Customers Elect Not to Renew Their Contracts in Fiscal Year 2009 and Beyond We have several large multi-year contracts for our full service sourcing services, some of which will come up for renewal during fiscal year 2009 and beyond. If these customers do not renew their contracts upon expiration, or if they elect to use one of our lower-cost self-service solutions, our future revenues may decrease. 17 A Decline in Revenues May Have a Disproportionate Impact on Operating Results and Require Further Reductions in Our Operating Expense Levels. Because our expense levels are relatively fixed in the near term and are based in part on expectations of our future revenues, any decline in our revenues to a level that is below our expectations would have a disproportionately adverse impact on our operating results for that quarter. We Are Subject to Evolving and Expensive Corporate Governance Regulations and Requirements. Our Failure to Adequately Adhere to These Requirements or the Failure or Circumvention of Our Controls and Procedures Could Seriously Harm Our Business and Results of Operations. Because we are a publicly-traded company, we are subject to certain federal, state and other rules and regulations, including those required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Compliance with these evolving regulations is costly and requires a significant diversion of management time and attention, particularly with regard to our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. Although we have reviewed our disclosure and internal controls and procedures in order to determine whether they are effective, our controls and procedures may not be able to prevent fraud or other errors in the future. Faulty judgments, simple errors or mistakes, or the failure of our personnel to adhere to established controls and procedures may make it impossible for us to ensure that the objectives of the control system are met. A failure of our controls and procedures to detect fraud or other errors could seriously harm our business and results of operations. We Sometimes Experience Long Implementation Cycles, Which May Increase Our Operating Costs and Delay Recognition of Revenues. Many of our products are complex applications that are generally deployed with many users. Implementation of these applications by enterprises is complex, time consuming and expensive. Long implementation cycles may delay the recognition of revenue as some of our customers engage us to perform system implementation services, which can defer revenue recognition for the related software license revenue. In addition, when we experience long implementation cycles, we may incur costs at a higher level than anticipated, which may reduce the anticipated profitability of a given implementation. If a Sufficient Number of Suppliers Do Not Join and Maintain Their Participation In the Ariba Supplier Network, It May Not Attract a Sufficient Number of Buyers and Other Sellers Required to Make the Network Successful. In order to provide buyers on the Ariba Supplier Network an organized method for accessing goods and services, we rely on suppliers to maintain web-based product catalogs, indexing services and other content aggregation tools. Any failure of suppliers to join the Ariba Supplier Network in sufficient numbers, or of existing suppliers to maintain their participation in the Ariba Supplier Network as a result of increase access charges or otherwise, would make the network less attractive to buyers and consequently other suppliers. Our inability to access and index these catalogs and services provided by suppliers would result in our customers having fewer products and services available to them through our solutions, which would adversely affect the perceived usefulness of the Ariba Supplier Network. We Could Be Subject to Potential Claims Related to Our On-Demand Solutions, As Well As the Ariba Supplier Network. We warrant to our customers that our on-demand solutions and the Ariba Supplier Network will achieve specified performance levels to allow our customers to conduct their transactions. To the extent we fail to meet warranted performance levels, we could be obligated to provide refunds or credits for future use or maintenance. Further, to the extent that a customer incurs significant financial hardship due to the failure of our on-demand solutions or the Ariba Supplier Network to perform as specified, we could be exposed to additional liability claims. 18 Failure to Establish and Maintain Strategic Relationships with Third Parties Could Seriously Harm Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition. We have established strategic relationships with a number of other companies. These companies are entitled to resell our products, to host our products for their customers, and/or to implement our products within their customers organizations. We cannot be assured that any existing or future resellers or hosting or implementation partners will perform to our expectations. For example, in the past we have not realized the anticipated benefits from strategic relationships with a number of resellers. If our current or future strategic partners do not perform to expectations, or if they experience financial difficulties that impair their operating capabilities, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. We Face Intense Competition. If We Are Unable to Compete Successfully, Our Business Will Be Seriously Harmed. The market for our solutions is intensely competitive, evolving and subject to rapid technological change. This competition could result in further price pressure, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, any one of which could seriously harm our business. Competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer. We compete with several major enterprise software companies, including SAP and Oracle. We also compete with several service providers, including McKinsey & Company and A.T. Kearney. In addition, we compete with smaller specialty vendors or smaller niche providers of sourcing or procurement products and services, including Emptoris, BravoSolution, Zycus, American Express S2S, Perfect Commerce, cc-Hubwoo, Ketera Technologies and Iasta. Because spend management is a relatively new software category, we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies if this market continues to develop and expand. For example, third parties that currently help implement Ariba Buyer and our other products could begin to market products and services that compete with our products and services. These third parties, which include IBM, Accenture, Capgemini, Deloitte Consulting, BearingPoint and Unisys, are generally not subject to confidentiality or non-compete agreements that restrict such competitive behavior. Many of our current and potential competitors, such as ERP software vendors including Oracle and SAP, have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, significantly greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than us. These vendors could also introduce spend management solutions that are included as part of broader enterprise application solutions at little or no cost to their customers. In addition, many of our competitors have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers and have extensive knowledge of our industry. In the past, we have lost potential customers to competitors for various reasons, including lower prices and incentives not matched by us. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address customer needs. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly increase their market share. We also expect that competition will increase as a result of industry consolidations. The industry has experienced consolidation with both larger and smaller competitors acquiring companies to broaden their offerings or increase scale. As a result, we may not be able to successfully compete against our current and future competitors. Any Future Acquisitions Will Be Subject to a Number of Risks. Any future acquisitions will be subject to a number of risks, including:  the diversion of management time and resources;  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;  the potential disruption of our ongoing business;  the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services;  unanticipated expenses related to integration of the acquired companies; 19  difficulties in implementing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel;  potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses; and  impairment of goodwill and other assets acquired. If We Fail to Develop Products and Services on a Timely and Cost-Effective Basis, or If Our Products or Services Contain Defects, Our Business Could Be Seriously Harmed. In developing new products and services, we may:  fail to develop, introduce and market products in a timely or cost-effective manner;  find that our products and services are obsolete, noncompetitive or have shorter life cycles than expected;  fail to develop new products and services that adequately meet customer requirements or achieve market acceptance; or  develop products that contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released. If new releases of our products or potential new products are delayed, we could experience a delay or loss of revenues and customer dissatisfaction. Pending Litigation Could Seriously Harm Our Business. There can be no assurance that existing or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, or that the amount of any accrued losses is sufficient for any actual losses that may be incurred. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We May Incur Additional Restructuring Charges that Adversely Affect Our Operating Results. We have recorded significant restructuring charges relating to the abandonment of numerous leased facilities, including most notably portions of our Sunnyvale, California headquarters. For example, in the year ended September 30, 2008, we evaluated our office space in Sunnyvale, California, and ceased use of approximately 54,000 square feet of space in our corporate headquarters and recorded lease abandonment costs of $5.9 million and leasehold impairments of $1.5 million. Moreover, we have from time to time revised our assumptions and expectations regarding lease abandonment costs, resulting in additional charges. We review these estimates each reporting period, and to the extent that our assumptions change, the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary significantly from current estimates. For example, a reduction in assumed market lease rates of $0.25 per square foot per month for the remaining term of the leases, with all other assumptions remaining the same, would increase the estimated lease abandonment loss on the vacated portions of our Sunnyvale, California headquarters by $1.7 million as of September 30, 2008. Additional lease abandonment costs, resulting from the abandonment of additional facilities or changes in estimates and expectations about facilities already abandoned, could adversely affect our operating results. We May Be Required to Record Impairment Charges in Future Quarters as a Result of the Decline in Value of Our Investments in Auction Rate Securities. We hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities (ARS) that represent investments in pools of assets, including student loans, commercial paper and credit derivative products. These ARS investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined 20 calendar intervals, allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par. The recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our holdings in ARS investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates. Consequently, the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process. Contractual maturity dates for these ARS investments range from 2016 to 2047 with principal distributions occurring on certain securities prior to maturity. The valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity. Although we currently have the ability and intent to hold these ARS investments until a recovery of the auction process or until maturity, if the current market conditions deteriorate further, or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur, we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income (loss) or to record all current and any future unrealized losses as a charge in our statement of operations in future quarters. We May Incur Goodwill Impairment Charges that Adversely Affect Our Operating Results. We review goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired and that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period, and decreases in our market capitalization below the recorded amount of our net assets for a sustained period. Our stock price is highly volatile and has experienced significant declines recently. The balance of goodwill is $406.5 million as of September 30, 2008 and, there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur. Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile and the Market Price of Our Common Stock May Decrease in the Future. Our stock price has fluctuated dramatically. There is a significant risk that the market price of our common stock will decrease in the future in response to any of the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:  variations in our quarterly operating results;  announcements that our revenues or income are below analysts expectations;  changes in analysts estimates of our performance or industry performance;  general economic slowdowns;  changes in market valuations of similar companies;  sales of large blocks of our common stock;  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;  the loss of a major customer or our failure to complete significant license transactions; and  additions or departures of key personnel. 21 We Are at Risk of Further Securities Class Action Litigation Due to Our Stock Price Volatility. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We have experienced significant volatility in the price of our stock over the past years. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources, which could seriously harm our business. If the Protection of Our Intellectual Property Is Inadequate, Our Competitors May Gain Access to Our Technology, and We May Lose Customers. We depend on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary rights of our technology. To protect our proprietary technology, we rely primarily on a combination of contractual provisions, including customer licenses that restrict use of our products, confidentiality agreements and procedures, and patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. We have 34 patents issued in the United States, but may not develop other proprietary products that are patentable. Despite our efforts, we may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary rights, and our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products or design around any patents issued to us. This is particularly true because some foreign laws do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as those of the United States and, in the case of our solutions, because the validity, enforceability and type of protection of proprietary rights in these technologies are uncertain and evolving. If we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, we may lose customers. There has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software industry and the Internet industry regarding intellectual property rights. For example, in the year ended September 30, 2008, we agreed to settle with Sky for $7.9 million related to two lawsuits alleging that certain products of Ariba and Procuri, Inc. (Procuri) infringed patents held by Sky. See LitigationGeneral in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. It is possible that in the future, other third parties may claim that we or our current or potential future products infringe their intellectual property rights. We expect that software product developers and providers of electronic commerce solutions will increasingly be subject to infringement claims, and third parties may claim that we or our current or potential future products infringe their intellectual property. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert managements time from developing our business, cause product shipment delays, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all, which could seriously harm our business. We must now, and may in the future have to, license or otherwise obtain access to intellectual property of third parties. For example, we are currently dependent on developers licenses from ERP, database, human resource and other systems software vendors in order to ensure compliance of our products with their management systems. In addition, we rely on technology that we license from third parties, including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our software products to perform key functions. For example, we license integration software from TIBCO for Ariba Buyer. If we are unable to continue to license any of this software on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we will face delays in releases of our software until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our current products or require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers. These delays, if they occur, could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, we may need to commence litigation or take other actions to protect our intellectual property rights. For example, in April 2007, we filed a lawsuit against Emptoris, Inc. (Emptoris) for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. See Litigation-Patent Litigation with Emptoris, Inc. in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These lawsuits and other potential litigation and actions brought by us could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. 22 If Our Security Measures Fail or Unauthorized Access to Customer Data Is Otherwise Obtained, Our Solutions May Be Perceived As Not Being Secure, Customers May Curtail or Stop Using Our Solutions, And We May Incur Significant Liabilities. Our operations involve the storage and transmission of our customers confidential information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, indemnity obligations and other liability. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to our customers data, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose potential revenues and existing customers. Further, because our products transmit data and information belonging to our customers, many customers and prospects require us to meet specific security standards or to maintain security certifications with respect to our products and operations. Given the complexity of our business and the costs and efforts required to meet the high standards to maintain these security certifications, there is no guarantee that we can achieve or maintain any such certifications or standards. If we fail to meet the standards for these security certifications, it could negatively impact our ability to attract new or keep existing customers and it could seriously harm our business. Anti-takeover Provisions in Our Charter Documents and Delaware Law Could Discourage, Delay or Prevent a Change in Control of Our Company and May Affect the Trading Price of Our Common Stock. Certain anti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of Delaware law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by our stockholders, may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and other rights of our stockholders. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
