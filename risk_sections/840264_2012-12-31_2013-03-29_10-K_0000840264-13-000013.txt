Item 1A. Risk Factors â€“ continued. If the Debtors are unable to obtain confirmation of the Joint Plan of Reorganization on a timely basis because of a challenge to the Joint Plan of Reorganization or a failure to satisfy the conditions to the effectiveness of the Joint Plan of Reorganization, the Debtors may be forced to operate in the Chapter 11 Cases for an extended period while trying to develop a different reorganization plan that can be confirmed. Protracted Chapter 11 Cases would increase both the probability and the magnitude of the adverse effects described above. If the Debtors are unable to raise sufficient capital through the anticipated Equity Infusion, the Debtors may still seek additional Bankruptcy Protection. The anticipated equity infusion from outside investors is a critical component of the likelihood of success of the Joint Plan of Reorganization. If Capitol is unable to raise capital from new investors, or raise less than the amount currently anticipated, it may be forced to operate in the Chapter 11 Cases for an extended period while trying to develop a different reorganization plan that can be confirmed. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable.
