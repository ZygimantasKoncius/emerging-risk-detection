Company Overview American Software, Inc. (American Software or the Company) was incorporated as a Georgia corporation in 1970. We develop, market and support a portfolio of software and services that deliver enterprise management and collaborative supply chain solutions to the global marketplace. Our software and services are designed to bring business value to enterprises by supporting their operations over intranets, extranets, client/servers or the Internet. References to the Company, our products, our software, our services and similar references include the appropriate business unit actually providing the product or service. We provide our software solutions through three major business segments, which are further broken down into a total of four major product and service groups. The three business segments are (1) Collaborative Supply Chain Management, (2) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and (3) Information Technology (IT) Consulting. The Collaborative Supply Chain Management segment consists of Logility, Inc., an 89% owned (as of the date of this filing), subsidiary which provides collaborative supply chain solutions to streamline and optimize the 3 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements production, distribution and management of products between trading partners. The ERP segment consists of (i) American Software ERP, which provides purchasing and materials management, customer order processing, financial, e-commerce, Flow Manufacturing and traditional manufacturing solutions, and (ii) New Generation Computing (NGC), which provides industry specific business software to both retailers and manufacturers in the Apparel, Sewn Products and Furniture industries.

(DMI), a St. Louis-based provider of supply chain planning systems marketed under the Demand Solutions® brand. The acquisition provided more than 800 active customers which brought the Logility customer base to approximately 1,100 companies, located in 70 countries and gives Logility what is believed to be the largest installed base of supply chain planning customers among application software vendors. Logility will continue to market and sell the Demand Solutions product line through Demand Managements existing value-added reseller distribution network. Logility will also continue to offer the Logility Voyager Solutions suite to its traditional target market of upper-midsize to Fortune 1000 companies with distribution-intensive supply chains. We derive revenues primarily from three sources: software licenses, services, and maintenance. We generally determine software license fees based on the number of modules, servers, users and/or sites licensed. Services and other revenues consist primarily of fees from software implementation, training, and consulting services. We bill primarily under time and materials arrangements and recognize revenues as we perform services. Maintenance agreements typically are for a one to three year term, usually commencing the time of the initial product license. We generally bill maintenance fees annually in advance under agreements with terms of one to three years, and then recognize the resulting revenues ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement. Deferred revenues represent advance payments or billings for software licenses, services and maintenance billed in advance of the time we recognize the related revenues. Our cost of revenues for licenses includes amortization of capitalized computer software development costs, salaries and benefits and value added reseller (VAR) commissions. Costs for maintenance and services revenues include the cost of personnel to conduct implementations, customer support and consulting, and other personnel-related expenses as well as agent commission expenses related to maintenance revenues generated by the indirect channel. Our selling expenses generally include the salary and commissions we pay to our direct sales professionals, along with marketing, promotional, travel and associated costs. Our general and administrative expenses generally include the salary and benefits we pay to executive, corporate and support personnel, as well as office rent, utilities, communications expenses, and various professional fees. Industry Background In response to increasing global competition, companies are continually seeking new ways to enhance the productivity of their operations. Computer software applications can be an effective tool for companies to re-engineer and streamline their core business processes. ERP applications help companies reduce employee headcount and increase employee utilization through recording, consolidating, and reporting the large quantities of transactional data that is generated through daily operations. Core ERP applications include automation of financials, human resources, and manufacturing functions. Included in the manufacturing function are supply chain applications that assist companies in managing relationships with external trading partners such as customers, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. Companies that effectively communicate, collaborate and integrate with their trading partners within the extended enterprise or supply chain can realize significant competitive advantages in the form of lower costs, 4 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements greater customer responsiveness, and increased revenue. Supply chain management refers to the process of managing the complex network of relationships that organizations maintain with external trading partners to source, manufacture and deliver goods and services to the end consumer. Supply chain management involves both the activities related to supplying products or services (source, make, move, buy, store, and deliver) as well as the sales and marketing activities that impact the demand for goods and services, such as new product introductions, promotions, pricing and forecasting. Today, several market trends are driving organizations to expand collaboration with trading partners along the supply chain. A general shift in market power has forced manufacturers and distributors to become more responsive to retailers and consumers, which has increased the demand for improved planning capabilities. At the same time, global economic conditions and competitive pressures are forcing manufacturers to reduce costs, decrease order cycle times and improve operating efficiencies. As a result, manufacturers, distributors and retailers are increasingly under pressure to better manage the supply chain as they seek to improve manufacturing efficiency and logistics operations while maintaining flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions and specific customer demands. These pressures are compounded by the increasing complexity and globalization of the interactions among suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and consumers. The growth and rapid adoption of the Internet has enhanced the ability of organizations to integrate their business processes through collaborative planning to synchronize internal assets and production with external demand and supplier capabilities. Global Internet technology adoption and supply chain strategies are converging to create a competitive advantage by reducing the cost of goods sold, improving customer service, building global brands and increasing global supply chain visibility as companies move product to market quicker. Our customers goal is to cost effectively provide the right product in the right place at the right time at a competitive price. To leverage the Internet for commercial benefit and facilitate enhanced collaboration among the various trading partners in the supply chain, organizations are increasingly deploying business-to-business application solutions to address their planning and supply chain execution requirements. The planning function involves the use of information to facilitate the delivery of the right products on time to the correct location and at the lowest cost. The planning process focuses on demand forecasting, inventory simulation, global sourcing, distribution, transportation and manufacturing planning and scheduling. Planning software is designed to increase revenues, improve forecast accuracy, optimize production scheduling, reduce inventory costs, decrease order cycle times, reduce transportation costs, and improve customer service. The supply chain execution function addresses procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, order fulfillment and distributing products throughout the supply chain. Within the supply chain execution function, organizations are increasing their focus on the effective management of warehouse and transportation operations and the need for integration with planning systems and other enterprise applications, in order to increase the efficient and effective fulfillment of customer orders in the business-to-business and the business-to-consumer sectors. In a report entitled Increase Profitability by Mastering Demand, (April 22, 2004), a leading information technology analyst firm, AMR Research, stated that increased demand visibility is achieved across the supply chain through increased collaboration with supply chain partners. With that better visibility comes perfect order performance. Inter-enterprise collaboration, a byproduct of the Demand-Driven Supply Network (DDSN), is vital to success in mastering demand in this new business context. With better demand forecast accuracy, companies average 15% lower inventories, 17% stronger perfect order fulfillment, and 35% shorter cash-to-cash cycle times. In order to effectively manage and coordinate supply chain activities, companies require supply chain planning, global sourcing, supply chain execution, and supply chain event management software that provides for integrated communication, optimization and collaboration among the various constituents throughout the supply chain network. This enhanced collaboration synchronizes production plans with demand forecasts, thereby minimizing bottlenecks that lead to production delays, excess inventory and distribution network problems. 5 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition, companies seek integrated planning and supply chain execution systems that further optimize the flow of products to their customers through enhanced transportation and warehouse management capabilities. Organizations are also demanding solutions that are modular and scaleable to fit the changing needs of the organization and offer rapid deployment and time-to-benefit and distribution network problems.

The Proven Method, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, is a technology services firm that specializes in assisting a diverse customer base to solve business issues with custom-developed technology solutions. The Proven Method maintains a full-time staff of over 120 technical specialists and business management consultants with a wide range of technical skills, business applications, and industry experience. We believe that a key differentiator of The Proven Method is its ability to offer flexibility among potential solutions that are determined by the individual needs of each customer. The solutions it provides can include custom development, implementation of third party packages, and the temporary use of our project managers and highly skilled technical resources to augment a customers in-house development team. The cross industry and cross platform experience that The Proven Method has acquired over the past 10 years enables us to provide services to virtually any type or size company. The Proven Methods customers typically benefit from our services in one of three ways: 1. Smaller and emerging firms rely on The Proven Method to serve in lieu of an in-house application development group. We provide these firms with the management and technical resources necessary to deliver custom-developed solutions. 2. Midsize companies will typically outsource complete application development projects to The Proven Method, particularly when their internal technical personnel face a combination of critical timing and heavy backlog. 3. Any size company can rely on The Proven Method to provide supplemental technical resources when the need arises for a skill or technical discipline that it may not currently possess or if it simply needs more of a particular set of skills required to complete large development projects. The Proven Method has worked with customers such as IBM, Georgia Tech Research Institute, Kubota Manufacturing of North America, The Home Depot, BellSouth, The State of Georgia, Xerox, Global Payments, and numerous small to midsize companies. 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Customers We primarily target businesses in the retail, apparel, consumer-packaged goods, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, industrial products and other manufacturing industries. During fiscal 2005, two customers accounted for 11% and 14% of our total revenues. A sample of companies that have purchased one or more of our products or services is as follows: Consumer Packaged Goods Chemicals, Oil & Gas, Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing and Others Avery Dennison Corporation Afrox Avondale Mills Ashley Furniture BP Lubricants Cintas Alberto-Culver Company Caremark Corning Cable Systems Bell Sports Cambrex Karlskoga AB Crown Crafts, Inc.

Komatsu Europe International Britsh Telecom Under Armour Performance Apparel NACCO Materials Handling Group Florida Power & Light Warnaco Peugeot International Huntsville Utilities Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing Remy International Piedmont Natural Gas VF Corporation Rheem Manufacturing Saudi Consolidated Electric Saab Aircraft Sprint Standard Motor Products Texas Utilities Verizon We typically experience a slight degree of seasonality reflected in a slowing of services revenues during the annual winter holiday season, which occurs in the third quarter of our fiscal year. We account for our backlog in deferred revenues (refer to note 1(c) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We are not reliant on government customers. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Integrated System Design While customers can use our software applications individually, we have designed them to be combined as integrated systems to meet unique customer requirements. The user may select virtually any combination of modules to form an integrated solution for a particular business problem. The license for such a solution could range from one single module to a multi-module, multiple-user solution incorporating the full range of our products. Customers frequently require services beyond those provided by our standard support/maintenance agreement. To meet those customers needs, we established a separate professional services division that provides specialized business and software implementation consulting, custom programming, on-site installation, system-to-system interfacing and extensive training. We provide these services, frequently referred to as systems integration services, for an additional fee normally under a separate contract, based upon time and materials utilized. Sales and Marketing We market our products through direct and indirect sales channels. We conduct our principal sales and marketing activities from corporate headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and have sales and/or support offices in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and Pittsburgh. We manage sales channels outside of North America from our international offices in the United Kingdom and Spain. Logility has a number of marketing alliances, including those with IBM and SSA Global Technologies (SSA). Generally, these marketing alliance agreements provide the vendors with non-exclusive rights to market our products and access to our marketing materials and product training. Some highlights of these agreements are as follows:  IBMwe entered into an agreement with IBM on March 17, 2000 pursuant to which we modified our Supply Chain products, with IBMs technical and financial assistance, to operate with IBMs eServer iSeries (AS/400) platform. Also, we agreed to market and support the IBM-compatible supply chain products that resulted from our efforts. IBM may also market our supply chain products and refer potential customers to Logility.  SSA Global TechnologiesOn November 17, 2001, we granted SSA a worldwide, non-exclusive license to name, package, market, distribute and supply the Logility Voyager Solutions suite as BPCS (Business Planning and Control Software) Collaborative Commerce powered by Logility. In exchange, SSA agreed to use all reasonable efforts to promote and sell the software. This agreement had an original expiration date of April 30, 2004, but is automatically extended for additional one year periods, unless either party terminates the agreement by giving 90 days written notice. In addition to these marketing alliances, we have developed a network of international agents who assist in selling our products outside the United States. We intend to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance our sales and marketing position. These independent distributors and resellers, located in Canada, South America, Europe and the Asia/Pacific region, distribute our product lines in foreign countries. These vendors typically sell their own consulting and systems integration services in conjunction with licensing our products. With the acquisition of Demand Management, Logility gained access to a global distribution channel consisting of 23 organizations with sales, implementation and support resources serving customers in 68 countries. We support our sales activities by conducting a variety of marketing programs including public relations, direct marketing, advertising, trade shows, product seminars, industry speakers, user group conferences and ongoing customer communication and industry analysts programs. We also participate in industry conferences such as those organized by the American Production and Inventory Control Specialists (APICS) and the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSMCP), formerly called the Council of Logistics Management (CLM). 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Licenses Like many business application software firms, software revenue consists principally of fees generated from licensing our software products. In consideration of the payment of license fees, we typically grant nonexclusive, nontransferable, perpetual licenses, which are primarily business unit, user-specific and geographically restricted. Our standard license agreement contains provisions designed to prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of our software. In these agreements we warrant that our products will function in accordance with the specifications set forth in our product documentation. The prices for our products are typically functions of the number of modules licensed and the number of servers, users and sites for which the solution is designed and deployed. Customer Service and Support We provide the following services and support to our customers: Implementation Support: We offer our customers a professional and proven implementation program that facilitates rapid implementation of our software products. Our consultants help customers define the nature of their project, and subsequently proceed through the implementation process. We provide training for all users and managers involved. We first establish measurable financial and logistical performance indicators, and then evaluate them for conformance during and after implementation. Additional services beyond implementation can include post-implementation reviews and benchmarks to further enhance the benefits to customers. Implementation: General Training Services. We offer our customers post-delivery professional services consisting primarily of implementation and training services, for which we typically charge on a daily basis. Customers that purchase implementation services receive assistance in integrating our solution with existing software applications and databases. Implementation of our products typically requires three to nine months, depending on factors such as the complexity of a customers existing systems, the number of modules purchased, and the number of end users. Product Maintenance and Updates: Support Services. We provide our customers with ongoing product support services. Typically, we enter into support or maintenance contracts with customers for an initial one to three year term, billed annually in advance, at the time of the product license with renewal for additional periods thereafter. Under these contracts, we provide telephone consulting, product updates and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services. We provide ongoing support and maintenance services on a seven-day-a-week, 24-hours-a-day basis through telephone, electronic mail and web-based support, using a call logging and tracking system for quality assurance. Research and Development Our future success depends in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products, respond to changing customer requirements, develop and introduce new or enhanced products, and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. We focus our development efforts on several areas, including, but not limited to, enhancing operability of our products across distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms, operating systems and relational databases, and adding functionality to existing products. These development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within a multi-tiered ERP and supply chain environment, including the Internet. Logilitys current release of Logility Voyager Solutions is version 7.0. This version uses an Internet-based architecture for maximum scalability and messaging functionality that supports the increasingly distributed nature of supply chain planning, global sourcing, supply chain execution and collaborative commerce. Logility Voyager Solutions interface with software of leading ERP vendors such as SAP, Oracle, PeopleSoft/JD Edwards, and SSA Global Technologies. 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The current release of Demand Solution One is version 9.1 and the current release of Demand Solutions Stores is version 4.1. These products are designed to work with a wide variety of MRP, ERP and legacy enterprise applications. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products, respond to changing customer requirements, develop and introduce new or enhanced products, and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. We focus our development efforts on several areas, including, but not limited to, enhancing operability of our products across distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms, operating systems and relational databases, and adding functionality to existing products. These development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within a multi-tiered supply chain environment, including the Internet. Our client/server and Internet-based solutions, which utilize the latest technologies, will be important for our long-term growth. As of April 30, 2005, we employed 89 persons in product research, development and enhancement activities. Competition Our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspects of the supply chain, as well as the enterprise application market as a whole. Our existing competitors include:  large enterprise resource planning (ERP) application software vendors such as SAP and Oracle, which recently acquired PeopleSoft/JD Edwards and Retek, each of which offers sophisticated ERP solutions that currently, or may in the future, incorporate supply chain management modules, advanced planning and scheduling, warehouse management, transportation or collaboration software;  vendors focusing on the supply chain application software market, including but not limited to, vendors such as i2 Technologies, JDA Software, and Manugistics;  other business application software vendors that may broaden their product offerings by internally developing, or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain management software; and  internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments. In addition, our Logility subsidiary may face competition from other application software vendors, including ERP vendors that from time to time jointly market Logilitys products as a complement to their own systems. To the extent such vendors develop or acquire systems with functionality comparable to Logilitys products, their significant installed customer base, long-standing customer relationships and ability to offer a broad solution could provide a competitive advantage over Logilitys products. We also expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for collaborative commerce and supply chain management software and new products and technologies are introduced. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. Increased competition could result in fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins and loss of market share. The principal competitive factors in the target markets in which we compete include product functionality and quality, domain expertise, integration technologies, product suite integration, breadth of products and related services such as customer support, training and implementation services. Other factors important to customers and prospects include:  customer service and satisfaction;  ability to provide relevant customer references; 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  compliance with industry-specific requirements and standards;  flexibility to adapt to changing business requirements;  ability to generate business benefits;  rapid payback and measurable return on investment;  vendor financial stability and company as well as product reputation; and  initial license price, cost to implement and long term total cost of ownership. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have a broader worldwide presence, longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater name recognition, and a larger installed base of customers than we have. Some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices, payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees. In order to be successful in the future, we must continue to develop innovative software solutions and respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors innovations. We may also have to lower prices or offer other favorable terms. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. We believe that our principal competitive advantages are our comprehensive, integrated solutions, our list of referenceable customers, the ability of our solutions to generate business benefits for our customers, our substantial investment in product development, our deep domain expertise, the ease of use of our software products, our customer support and implementation services, our ability to deploy quickly, and our ability to deliver rapid return on investment for our customers. Proprietary Rights and Licenses Our success and ability to compete are dependent in part upon our proprietary technology. To protect our proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, which may afford only limited protection. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. Although we rely on the limited protection afforded by such confidential and contractual procedures and intellectual property laws, we also believe that factors such as the knowledge, ability, and experience of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, reliable maintenance and timeliness and quality of support services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. We presently have no patents or patent applications pending. The source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work. Generally copyrights on our products expire 95 years after the year of first publication of each product. We enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and customers, and control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. In addition, we have registered certain trademarks and have registration applications pending for other trademarks. We provide our software products to customers under non-exclusive license agreements. As is customary in the software industry, in order to protect our intellectual property rights, we do not sell or transfer title to our products to our customers. Although the license agreements place restrictions on the customers use of our products, unauthorized use of our products nevertheless may occur. Despite measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In the future, we may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products. In addition, we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any such claims against us, with or without merit, as well as claims initiated by us against third parties, can be time consuming and expensive to defend, prosecute or resolve. Moreover, an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, require a substantial amount of attention from management, require disputed rights to be licensed from others, require us to enter into royalty arrangements or require us to cease the marketing or use of certain products, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. To the extent that we desire or are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others, there can be no assurance that any such licenses will be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. We have relicensed, and expect in the future to relicense, certain software from third parties for use in connection with our products. There can be no assurance that these third-party software vendors will not change their product offerings or that these software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The termination of any such licenses or product offerings, or the failure of the third-party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products, could result in delays in our ability to ship certain of our products while we seek to implement technology offered by alternative sources. Any required replacement licenses could prove costly. Further, any such delay, if it becomes extended, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Company Strategy The objective of American Software is to become a leading provider of enterprise-wide ERP and collaborative supply chain solutions to enable small, medium, large and Fortune 1000 companies to optimize their operations associated with the planning, sourcing, manufacture, storage, and distribution of products. Our strategy includes the following key elements: Leverage and Expand Installed Base of Customers. We currently target businesses in the consumer goods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, apparel and sewn products, and oil and gas industries. We intend to continue to leverage our installed base of more than 1,450 customers to introduce additional functionality, product upgrades, and complementary modules. In addition, we intend to expand sales to new customers in our existing vertical markets and to target additional vertical markets over time. Continue to Expand Sales and Marketing. We intend to continue to pursue an increased share of the market for ERP and supply chain management software solutions by expanding our sales and marketing activities. We believe our competitive advantage includes providing a rapid implementation, easy-to-maintain configuration, and quick time-to-benefit across the full spectrum of customer operations. Logility intends to continue building a direct sales force that is focused on selected vertical markets, such as consumer goods, retail and manufacturing supply chains, and New Generation Computing intends to continue to focus on the Apparel, Sewn Goods, and Furniture industries, adding sales and marketing resources when appropriate. Expand Indirect Channels to Increase Market Penetration. We believe that key relationships with value added resellers will increase sales and expand market penetration of our products and services. For example, Logility has established a relationship with SSA Global Technologies to market, sell, implement and support components of the Logility Voyager Solutions suite such as the BPCS (Business Planning and Control Software) Collaborative Commerce Suite powered by Logility. The acquisition of Demand Management added 9 domestic and 14 international value-added resellers (VARs) to Logilitys indirect channel in fiscal 2005. This experienced 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements global distribution network significantly expands Logilitys reach and provides sales, implementation and support resources serving customers in 70 countries. Maintain Technology Leadership. Logility believes that it is a technology leader in the field of collaborative supply chain optimization solutions and intends to continue to provide innovative, advanced solutions and services to this market. Logility believes that it was one of the earliest providers of supply chain management software solutions on a client-server platform and on Windows, and the first to introduce a collaborative supply chain planning solution that operates over the Internet. Logility intends to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. Invest Aggressively to Build Market Share. We intend to continue to invest to expand our sales force, research and development efforts, and consulting infrastructure, balanced with our goal of increasing profitability. We believe these investments are necessary to increase our market share and to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the market. Acquire or Invest in Complementary Businesses, Products and Technologies. We believe that select acquisitions or investments may provide opportunities to broaden our product offering to provide more advanced solutions for our target markets. We will evaluate acquisitions or investments that will provide us with complementary products and technologies, expand our geographic presence and distribution channels, penetrate additional vertical markets with challenges and requirements similar to those we currently meet, and further solidify our leadership position within the supply chain management market. Focus on Integrated Collaborative Planning and Supply Chain Execution Solution. Logility believes it is one of the few providers of truly integrated supply chain management software solutions addressing demand and supply planning as well as transportation and warehousing logistics requirements. Logility Voyager Solutions provide a comprehensive suite for supply chain planning, warehouse and transportation management with collaboration at its core, streamlining business processes between both internal and external trading partners. Logility intends to continue to focus its development initiatives on enhancing its end-to-end solution, expanding its embedded performance management architecture and introducing additional capabilities that complement its integrated solution suite. Increase Penetration of International Markets. In the fiscal year ended April 30, 2005, we generated 8% of our total revenues from international sales, resulting from marketing relationships with a number of international distributors. The acquisition of Demand Management by Logility added 9 domestic and 14 international value-added resellers (VARs) to its indirect channel in fiscal 2005. This experienced global distribution network significantly expands Logilitys reach and provides sales, implementation and support resources serving customers in 70 countries. We and Logility intend to further expand our international presence by creating additional relationships with distributors in South America, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific region. Expand Strategic Relationships. Logility intends to expand the depth and number of strategic relationships with leading enterprise software, systems integrators and service providers to integrate the Logility Voyager Solutions suite into their services and products and to create joint marketing opportunities. Logility has a number of marketing alliances, including those with IBM and SSA Global Technologies. In addition, Logility has developed a network of international agents who assist in the sale and support of its products. Logility intends to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance its sales and marketing position. Continue to Focus on Providing High Quality Customer Service. Providing high quality customer service is a critical element of our strategy. We intend to continue to invest in technology and personnel to accommodate the needs of our growing customer base. We will continue to seek new ways to improve service to our customers. 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Implement E-Business Strategy. Logility has launched an e-Business initiative that will enable Logility to build on current applications while moving toward total Internet-based value chain management. Logilitys e-Business strategy includes products and services designed to enable the optimization of the customers supply chain and improve collaboration. In launching this initiative, Logility intends to do the following:  Continue to develop and sell e-Intelliprise capabilities that capitalize on the speed and flexibility of the Internet with the collaborative planning and logistics capabilities of the software.  Continue to develop and sell the e-Application products that leverage the Internet to improve processes and communications.  Continue to develop and sell the e-Sourcing products that enable global collaborative sourcing over the Internet. Focus on Mid-Market. We have defined as Mid-Market those corporations or divisions of corporations that have annual revenues ranging from $200 million to $4 billion. Organizations of this size fit our historical customer profile, and are prime candidates for the purchase and use of our and Logilitys unique full suites of integrated products. There can be no assurance, however, that we and Logility will be successful in implementing the strategy outlined above. Employees As of April 30, 2005, we had 304 full-time employees, including 89 in product research, development and enhancement, 38 in customer support, 92 in professional services, 47 in marketing, sales and sales support, and 38 in accounting, facilities and administration. We believe that our continued success will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical, marketing and management personnel, who may be in great demand. We believe our employee relations are good. We have never had a work stoppage and no employees are represented under collective bargaining arrangements.
