Risk Factors Our business, financial condition, results of our operations or share price could be materially adversely affected by any or all of the following risks, or by others that we cannot identify. In addition to the following risk factors, we face certain market risks that are discussed under the headings Treasury Risk Management, Liquidity Risk, Interest Rate Risk Currency Risk, Fair Value Analysis, Commodities and Credit Risk on pages 52 to 54. WE OPERATE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE WERE UNABLE TO RESPOND TO RAPID CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES OR OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS. Both the beverage and confectionery industries are highly competitive. We compete with other multinational corporations which have significant financial resources to respond to and develop the markets in which both we and they operate. These resources may be applied to change areas of focus or to increase investments in marketing or new products. Furthermore, consumer tastes are susceptible to change. If we are unable to respond successfully to rapid changes in demand or consumer preferences, our sales or margins could be adversely affected. OUR PRODUCTS COULD BECOME CONTAMINATED, WHICH COULD BE EXPENSIVE TO REMEDY, CAUSE DELAYS IN MANUFACTURING AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. Despite safety measures adopted by the Group, our products could become contaminated or not meet quality or safety standards. We use many ingredients in manufacturing beverages and confectionery, which increases the risk of either accidental or malicious contamination. Any contamination or failure to meet quality and safety standards may be expensive to remedy and could cause delays in manufacturing and have adverse effects on our reputation and financial condition. WE DEPEND ON LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH BOTTLERS, AND ANY TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. Around 60% of our soft drinks business in the US is conducted through licensing arrangements with third-party bottlers, in some of which our major competitors have substantial equity interests. These bottlers may come under pressure to replace our brands with competitor products, and although we would be able to re-license these brands, such a change could adversely affect volumes and profit, particularly in the short-term. In addition, inappropriate action by or an incident at a licensee partner involving our brands could impact the reputation of Cadbury Schweppes brands or the Group as a whole. THE FAILURE OF THIRD PARTIES TO WHOM WE HAVE OUTSOURCED BUSINESS FUNCTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. An increasing proportion of our business functions is outsourced to third parties. Failure of the third parties to deliver on their contractual obligations or failure of Cadbury Schweppes to structure or manage our agreement with them effectively could lead to adverse effects on our reputation and financial condition. CONCENTRATION OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE COULD LEAD TO INCREASED PRICING PRESSURES AND DECLINING MARGINS. There is a trend towards a greater concentration of our customer base around the world, due to consolidation of the retail trade. Pricing pressures from customers in countries with concentrated retail trades could adversely impact our sales or margins. 6 Table of Contents WEATHER AND CLIMATIC CHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. Short-term fluctuations in weather or longer-term climatic changes may impact our business by affecting the supply or price of raw materials, or the manufacturing, distribution or demand for our products. WE DEPEND ON ENTERPRISE-WIDE TECHNOLOGY AND ANY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION TO OUR EQUIPMENT OR COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSSES. We depend on accurate, timely information and numerical data from key software applications to aid day-to-day decision-making. Any disruption caused by failings in these systems, of underlying equipment or of communication networks, for whatever reason, could delay or otherwise impact day-to-day decision-making, or cause us material financial losses. WE DEPEND ON OUR SUBSTANTIAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND ANY CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT COULD REQUIRE US TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND, IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. We and our major competitors have substantial intellectual property rights and interests which could potentially come into conflict. If any patent infringement or other intellectual property claims against us are successful, we may, among other things, be enjoined from, or required to cease, the development, manufacture, use and sale of products that infringe others patent rights; be required to expend significant resources to redesign our products so that they do not infringe others patent rights, which may not be possible; and/or be required to obtain licences to the infringed intellectual property, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or even at all. There is also the risk that intellectual property litigation against us could significantly disrupt our business, divert managements attention, and consume financial resources. OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER AS A RESULT OF CHANGING GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. Production, distribution and sale of many of our products are subject to governmental regulation regarding the production, sale, safety, labelling and composition/ ingredients of such products in the various countries and governmental regions in which we operate. In addition, the manufacture of many of our products, and other activities, are subject to governmental regulation relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, and the reclamation and re-cycling of packaging waste. At all times we are subject to employment and health and safety legislation in those countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these regulations increase our costs and any violation could lead to reputational damage to our business. WE OPERATE IN MANY COUNTRIES GLOBALLY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN DOING BUSINESS IN THESE COUNTRIES. We are subject to substantial government and other regulation, customs and practice which vary from country to country, and which may change dramatically as a result of political, economic or social events. Such changes may be wide-ranging and cover cross-border trading, accounting practices, taxation, data confidentiality and protection, employment practices and environment, health and safety issues, and involve actions such as product recalls, seizure of products and other sanctions. A number of countries in which we operate maintain controls on the repatriation of earnings and capital. Our failure to respond successfully and rapidly to the above or to changes in any or all of them, or to have controls and procedures in place which allow us to do so, could cause adverse effects to our reputation and financial condition. Our operations in individual countries are dependent for the proper functioning of their business on other parts of the Group in terms of product, technology, funding and support services. Any failure of one part of the Group, or a failure by the Group to exercise proper control of its operations in one or more countries, could materially adversely impact the financial performance and condition, and reputation, of other business units or the Group as a whole. 7 Table of Contents ANY SIGNIFICANT MANUFACTURING OR LOGISTICAL DISRUPTION COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE AND SELL PRODUCTS WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR REVENUES TO DECLINE. Our manufacturing and distribution facilities could be disrupted for reasons beyond our control, such as extremes of weather, fire, supplies of material or services, systems failure, workforce actions or environmental issues. Any significant manufacturing or logistical disruptions could affect our ability to make and sell products which could cause revenues to decline. OUR ONGOING RESTRUCTURING OF PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS COULD LEAD TO UNFORESEEN ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS. There is an ongoing programme of restructuring our production facilities and operations across the Group. Major unforeseen difficulties arising in connection with such restructuring could reduce our revenues and earnings. THE KEY RAW MATERIALS THAT WE USE IN OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN PRICE AND SUPPLY, AND THIS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS. Our business depends upon the availability, quality and cost of raw materials from around the world, which exposes us to price and supply fluctuation. Key items such as cocoa, milk, sweeteners, packaging materials and energy are subject to potentially significant fluctuations. While we take measures to protect against the short-term impact of these fluctuations, there can be no assurance that any shortfalls will be recovered. A failure to recover higher costs or shortfalls in availability or quality could decrease our profitability. BECAUSE OUR RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE FUNDED THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN VOLATILE CAPITAL MARKETS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE A SHORTFALL IN FUNDING OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS, WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION. We have various retirement and healthcare benefit schemes which are funded via investments in equities, bonds and other external assets. The scheme liabilities reflect our latest estimate of life expectancy, inflation, discount rates and salary growth. The values of such assets are dependent on, among other things, the performance of the equity and debt markets, which are volatile. Any shortfall in our funding obligations may require significant additional funding from the employing entities. GOVERNMENTAL ACTION, OR CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS REGARDING RISING OBESITY LEVELS OR OTHER HEALTH ISSUES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. Many countries face rising obesity levels due to an imbalance between energy consumed via food and expended through activity. The reasons for the changes in society and for some individuals having a greater inclination to obesity are multifaceted and complex. There are risks associated with the possibility of government action against the food industry, such as levying additional taxes on or restricting the advertising of certain product types. This could increase our tax burden or make it harder for us to market our products, reducing sales and/or profits. Also, consumer tastes may change rapidly for health-related reasons, and if we are unable to respond our sales or margins could decline. 8 Table of Contents ACTIONS OF GOVERNMENT, THE MEDIA OR NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE OPERATE MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN REGULATION OR ADVERSE REPUTATIONAL IMPACTS. In many countries where we operate there is increasing scrutiny of major multinational companies such as ours in relation to our operations and the products that we manufacture and market. There are a diverse range of issues and trends that may be manifested through this including: the role of foreign owned companies; employment issues relating to outsourcing and off-shoring and other labour practices; the role of corporations in relation to environmental issues such as climate change; the marketing of products that are considered high in fat and sugar in the context of growing concerns relating to obesity and ethical and sustainable raw material sourcing policies. These trends may be a risk through the actions of government, the media or non-governmental organisations, such as lobby and pressure groups, who may influence the regulatory and consumer environment against which we operate with reputational and financial impacts. RISKS INHERENT IN THE ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES AND PRODUCTS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. From time to time, the Group makes acquisitions of businesses and products. There can be no assurance that the Group has anticipated all problems, or that all losses associated with the recently acquired business may come to light prior to the expiration of any warranty and indemnity protections. Any failure in the Groups due diligence of the operating and financial condition of these acquired businesses, or of their integration into the Groups operations, could have an adverse impact on the Groups businesses or the Group as a whole. WE CAN OFFER NO ASSURANCES REGARDING THE ULTIMATE EFFECT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SEPARATION OF OUR AMERICAS BEVERAGES BUSINESS. On March 15, 2007, we announced our intention to separate our confectionery and Americas Beverages businesses, and we are evaluating the options for separation. Structuring and effecting this separation will require significant attention from management, who may as a result be diverted from other strategic actions, and will be subject to all the risks inherent in a significant divestiture. We can offer no assurance as to the ultimate effect this intention to separate will have on our share price. 9 Table of Contents ITEM
