Risk Factors An investment in our securities involves a number of risks. You should carefully consider the following information about the risks we face, together with the other information in this document, when you make investment decisions involving our securities. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prices of our securities. We have been and expect to continue to be affected by the ongoing global financial crisis and economic downturn. As a global investment bank with a large private clients franchise, our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally. Over the past year, these conditions have changed significantly and negatively and continue to deteriorate. Since the second half of 2007, and particularly since September 2008, the financial services industry, including ourselves, and the global financial markets have been materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all classes of financial assets. The declines initially occurred in financial assets linked to or backed by U.S. subprime residential mortgages, but soon spread to nearly all other asset classes, including mortgage and real estate asset classes, leveraged finance loans and equities. The financial markets have been, and continue to be, characterized by unprecedented levels of volatility (rapid changes in price direction) and the breakdown of historically observed correlations (the extent to which prices move in tandem) across asset classes, compounded by extremely limited liquidity. This has materially and adversely affected the availability and performance of instruments used to hedge positions and manage risk. Furthermore, there has been a widespread loss of investor confidence, initially and most severely in financial institutions, but more recently also in companies in a number of other industries and in the broader markets. Market conditions have also led to the failure or merger under distressed conditions of a number of prominent financial institutions. Financial institution failures or near-failures have resulted in losses, including for us, as a consequence of defaults on securities issued by them and defaults under bilateral derivatives and other contracts entered into with such entities as counterparties. Furthermore, declining asset values, defaults on mortgages and consumer loans, and the lack of market and investor confidence, as well as other factors, have all combined to increase the spreads, or costs, on credit default swaps, which are instruments used to manage credit risks, to cause rating agencies to lower credit ratings, including our own, and to otherwise increase the cost and decrease the availability of liquidity, despite very significant declines in central bank borrowing rates and other government actions. While governments, regulators and central banks worldwide, including in Germany and the U.S., have taken numerous steps to increase liquidity and to restore investor confidence, asset values have continued to decline and access to liquidity continues to be very limited. As of the end of 2008, Europe, the U.S. and other important economies were contracting. Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions continues to be greatly reduced and local governments and many companies are in serious economic difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. Unemployment has increased significantly. 7 Table of Contents 20-F Item 3: Key Information As described further below, these extremely adverse financial market and economic conditions have negatively impacted many of our businesses, particularly our credit trading, equity and derivatives trading, mortgage, leveraged finance, corporate finance and investment management businesses, and we have no reason to expect that these conditions will improve in the near or medium term. Until they do, we expect our results of operations to continue to be materially and adversely affected. Market declines and volatility can materially adversely affect our revenues and profits. In recent years we have increased our exposure to the financial markets as we have emphasized growth in our investment banking activities, including trading activities. Accordingly, we are more at risk from the adverse developments in the financial markets than we were when we derived a larger percentage of our revenues from traditional lending activities. Market declines have caused and can continue to cause our revenues to decline, and, if we are unable to reduce our expenses at the same pace, can cause our profitability to erode or cause us to show material losses, as we did in 2008. Volatility can also adversely affect us, by causing the value of financial assets we hold to decline or the expense of hedging our risks to rise. We have incurred and may continue to incur significant losses from our trading and investment activities due to market fluctuations. We enter into and maintain large trading and investment positions in the fixed income, equity and currency markets, primarily through our Corporate Banking & Securities Corporate Division.
