Item 1A. Risk Factors. You should carefully consider the following factors, together with all the other information included in this report, in evaluating our company and our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and the value of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. As such, you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. Risks Related to Pending Governmental Investigations and Litigation Any resolution of the ongoing investigations being conducted by certain federal and state agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are currently under investigation by federal and state authorities, including AHCA, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Florida (the USAO), the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the Civil Division), the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the OIG) and the Florida Attorney Generals Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU). Pursuant to an agreement dated August 18, 2008 with AHCA, the USAO and MFCU, two of our subsidiaries, WellCare of Florida, Inc. and HealthEase of Florida, Inc. (together, the WellCare Florida HMOs), agreed to transmit 20 Table of Contents $35.2 million (the Transmitted Amount) to the Financial Litigation Unit of the USAO. The Transmitted Amount was based on our best estimate, as of the effective date of the agreement, of the total potential amount of Medicaid behavioral health capitation refunds that the WellCare Florida HMOs owe or may owe to AHCA for calendar years 2002 through 2006, but did not include any interest, fines, penalties or other assessments that may be imposed against us. Of the total Transmitted Amount, we acknowledged and agreed that the WellCare Florida HMOs would make payment of not less than a total amount of $24.5 million, and therefore we authorized the USAO, AHCA and MFCU to access and distribute the $24.5 million to the appropriate federal and state agencies in accordance with applicable federal and state law. In addition, the parties to the agreement acknowledged and agreed that $10.7 million of the Transmitted Amount would be held in an escrow account pending resolution of all federal and related state claims by the United States or the State of Florida for monetary damages or other financial impositions of any kind arising from, or related to, the investigation by MFCU or the USAO. The amount held in escrow does not limit in any way the ability of federal or state authorities to recover additional amounts, including interest, civil or criminal fines, penalties or other assessments that may be imposed against us, and we cannot make any assurances that the federal or state authorities will not seek or be entitled to recover amounts in excess of the escrowed amounts. The agreement did not, nor should it be construed to, operate as a settlement or release of any criminal, civil or administrative claims for monetary, injunctive or other relief against us, whether under federal, state or local statutes, regulations or common law. Furthermore, the agreement does not operate, nor should it be construed, as a concession that we are entitled to any limitation of our potential federal, state or local civil or criminal liability. We are engaged in resolution discussions as to matters under review with the USAO, the Civil Division, the OIG and the State of Florida. Any resolution of the ongoing investigations being conducted by certain federal and state agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Based on the current status of matters and all information known to us to date, in the year ended December 31, 2007 we recorded selling, general and administrative expense and accrued a liability in the amount of $50.0 million in connection with the resolution of these matters, which is included in the Other accrued expenses item within our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2007, and 2008, respectively. We believe that it is probable that the actual resolution amount for all such matters under review will be more than the amounts that have already been reflected in our financial statements; however, we cannot provide an estimable range of additional amounts, if any, nor can we provide assurances regarding the timing, terms and conditions of any potential negotiated resolution of pending investigations by the USAO, the Civil Division, the OIG or the State of Florida. We have responded to subpoenas issued by the State of Connecticut Attorney Generals Office involving transactions between us and our affiliates and their potential impact on the costs of Connecticuts Medicaid program. In addition, the SEC is conducting an informal investigation. We do not know whether, or the extent to which, any pending investigations will result in the imposition of operating restrictions on our business. If we were to plead guilty to or be convicted of a health care related charge, potential adverse consequences could include revocation of our licenses, termination of one or more of our contracts and/or exclusion from further participation in Medicare or Medicaid programs. In addition, we could be required to operate under a corporate integrity agreement or under the supervision of a monitor, either of which could require us to operate under significant restrictions, place substantial burdens on our management, hinder our ability to attract and retain qualified associates and cause us to incur significant costs. Further, the majority of our contracts pursuant to which we provide Medicare and Medicaid services contain provisions that grant the regulator broad authority to terminate at will contracts with any entity affiliated with a convicted entity or for other reasons. Any such outcomes would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The pendency of these investigations as well as the litigation described below could also impair our ability to raise additional capital, which may be needed to pay any resulting interest, civil or criminal fines, penalties or other assessments. We and certain of our past officers and directors are defendants in litigation relating to our participation in federal health care programs, accounting practices and other related matters, and the outcome of these lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Putative class action complaints were filed against us, as well as certain of our past and present officers and directors on October 26, 2007 and on November 2, 2007, alleging, among other things, numerous violations of securities laws. Subsequent developments in these cases are described below in Part I  Item 3  Legal Proceedings. In addition, five putative shareholder derivative actions were filed between October 29, 2007 and November 15, 2007. All five actions contend, among other things, that the defendants allegedly allowed or caused us to misrepresent our reported financial results, in amounts unspecified in the pleadings, and seek damages and equitable relief for, among other things, the defendants supposed breach of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment. Subsequent developments in these cases are described below in Part I  Item 3  Legal Proceedings. In addition, in a letter dated October 15, 2008, the Civil Division informed counsel to the Special Committee that as part of the pending civil inquiry, the Civil Division is investigating a number of qui tam complaints filed by relators against us under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. sections 3729-3733. The seal in those cases has been partially lifted for 21 Table of Contents the purpose of authorizing the Civil Division to disclose to us the existence of the qui tam complaints. The complaints otherwise remain under seal as required by 31 U.S.C. section 3730(b)(3). We and the Special Committee are undertaking to discuss with the Civil Division, and address, allegations by the qui tam relators. We also learned from a docket search that a former employee filed a qui tam action on October 25, 2007 in state court for Leon County, Florida against several defendants, including us and one of our subsidiaries. Because qui tam actions brought under federal and state false claims acts are sealed by the court at the time of filing, we are unable to determine the nature of the allegations and, therefore, we do not know whether this action relates to the subject matter of the federal investigations. It is possible that additional qui tam actions have been filed against us and are under seal. Thus, it is possible that we are subject to liability exposure under the False Claims Act, or similar state statutes, based on qui tam actions other than those discussed in this 2008 Form 10-K. At this time, we cannot predict the probable outcome of these claims. These and other potential actions that may be filed against us, whether with or without merit, may divert the attention of management from our business, harm our reputation and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For a discussion of the aforementioned proceedings, see Part I  Item 3  Legal Proceedings. Our indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Under Delaware law, our charter and bylaws and certain indemnification agreements to which we are a party, we have an obligation to indemnify, or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify, certain of our current and former directors, officers and associates with respect to current and future investigations and litigation, including the matters discussed in Part I  Item 3  Legal Proceedings. In connection with some of these pending matters, we are required to, or we have otherwise agreed to, advance, and have advanced, significant legal fees and related expenses to several of our current and former directors, officers and associates and expect to continue to do so while these matters are pending. Certain of these obligations may not be covered matters under our directors and officers liability insurance, or there may be insufficient coverage available. Further, in the event the directors, officers and associates are ultimately determined to not be entitled to indemnification, we may not be able to recover the amounts we previously advanced to them. In addition, we have incurred significant expenses in connection with the pending investigations and litigation. We maintain directors and officers liability insurance in the amounts of $45.0 million for indemnifiable claims and $10.0 million for non-indemnifiable securities claims. We have met the retention limits under these policies. We also maintain insurance in the amount of $120.0 million which provides coverage for our independent directors and officers hired after January 24, 2008 for certain potential matters to the extent they occur after October 2007. We cannot provide any assurances that pending claims, or claims yet to arise, will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies, that such claims are covered by the terms of our insurance policies or that our insurance carrier will be able to cover our claims. Due to these insurance coverage limitations, we may incur significant unreimbursed costs to satisfy our indemnification and other obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Continuing negative publicity regarding the investigations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. As a result of the ongoing federal and state investigations, shareholder and derivative litigation, restatement of our previously issued financial statements and related matters, we have been the subject of negative publicity. This negative publicity may harm our relationships with current and future investors, government regulators, associates, members, vendors and providers. For example, it is possible that the negative publicity and its effect on our work environment could cause our associates to terminate their employment or, if they remain employed by us, result in reduced morale that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and, therefore, associates and prospective associates may also consider our stability and the value of any equity incentives when making decisions regarding employment opportunities. Additionally, negative publicity may adversely affect our reputation, which could harm our ability to obtain new membership, building or maintaining our network of providers, or business in the future. For example, when making award determinations, states frequently consider the plans historical regulatory compliance and reputation. As a result, continuing negative publicity regarding the investigations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The investigations and related matters have diverted, and are expected to continue to divert, managements attention, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition to the challenges of the various government investigations and extensive litigation we face, our management team has spent considerable time and effort with regard to the internal and external investigations involving our historical accounting practices 22 Table of Contents and internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. In particular, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel, as well as senior members of our finance and legal departments, have spent considerable time and effort with regard to the investigations, the restatement and related matters. The significant time and effort spent by our management team on these matters has diverted, and is expected to continue to divert, its attention, which has, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business. Risks Related to Our Business We have expended, and expect to continue to expend, significant financial resources as a result of the government and Special Committee investigations, which will reduce our cash available to meet statutory reserve requirements, debt service payments and other corporate obligations for our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows. Through December 31, 2008, we had incurred a total of approximately $124.1 million in administrative expenses associated with, or consequential to, the government and Special Committee investigations, including legal fees, accounting fees, consulting fees, employee recruitment and retention costs and similar expenses. Approximately $103.0 million of these investigation related costs were incurred in 2008. We expect to continue incurring significant additional costs as a result of the federal and state investigations and pending civil actions, including administrative expenses similar to those discussed above, and costs necessary to improve our corporate governance and address other issues that were identified through the restatement and remediation processes. We may also be required to pay significant damages or other amounts in the event of an adverse judgment or settlement. A substantial amount of these costs will not be covered by, or may exceed the limits of, our insurance. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, such payments may limit cash available for our operations and could impair our ability to meet certain statutory capital reserve requirements. Further, if we cannot obtain additional financing, our cash generated by operations may not be sufficient to meet these obligations. We are engaged in resolution discussions as to matters under review with the USAO, the Civil Division, the OIG and the State of Florida. Based on the current status of matters and all information known to us to date, in the year ended December 31, 2007 we recorded selling, general and administrative expense and accrued a liability in the amount of $50.0 million in connection with the resolution of these matters, which is included in the Other accrued expenses line item within our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2007, and 2008, respectively. We believe that it is probable that the actual resolution amount for all such matters under review will be more than the amounts that have already been reflected in our financial statements; however, we cannot provide an estimable range of additional amounts, if any, nor can we provide assurances regarding the timing, terms and conditions of any potential negotiated resolution of pending investigations by the USAO, the Civil Division, the OIG or the State of Florida. If we were required to pay a significant amount as restitution and/or a fine or penalty in the near term as part of any resolution, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows. For more information related to this accrual, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this 2008 Form 10-K. If we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in future periods, it could require us to incur substantial costs and divert management resources in connection with our efforts to remediate these material weaknesses and to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. Specifically, we concluded that (a) former senior management set an inappropriate tone in connection with the Companys efforts to comply with the regulatory requirements related to certain Medicaid contracts that led to a deficiency in the design in our internal controls, and therefore a material weakness existed in a portion of the control environment and control activities components of our internal controls, and (b) former senior managements failure to ensure effective communications regarding certain Medicaid contracts with, among others, our Board and certain regulators resulted in a material weakness in the information and communication system. Solely as a result of the material weaknesses described above, our management also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2007. We cannot be certain that any remedial measures we have taken or intend to take will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future and, accordingly, additional material weaknesses may occur in the future. It is possible that additional control deficiencies may be identified in addition to, or that are unrelated to, our review of the work of the Special Committee. These control deficiencies may represent one or more material weaknesses. Our inability to remedy any additional deficiencies or material weaknesses that may be identified in the future could, among other things, cause us to fail to file timely our periodic reports with the SEC; result in the need to further restate our historical financial statements; prevent us from providing reliable and accurate financial information and forecasts or from avoiding or detecting fraud; or require us to incur additional costs or divert management resources to, among other things, comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 23 Table of Contents If our government contracts are not renewed or are renewed on substantially different terms, are terminated or become subject to an enrollment or marketing freeze, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. We provide our Medicaid, Medicare, S-CHIP and other services through a limited number of contracts with state, federal or local government agencies. These contracts generally have terms of one to four years and are subject to non-renewal by the applicable government agency. All of our government contracts are terminable for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations. Our federal and state government contracts are generally subject to cancellation, non-renewal or a potential freeze on marketing or enrollment in the event of the unavailability of adequate program funding, compliance violations or for other reasons. In some jurisdictions, a cancellation or enrollment freeze may be immediate, while in other jurisdictions a notice period is required. For example, during 2008, we were subject to a 60-day Medicaid marketing freeze in three counties in Florida resulting from the states allegation of wrongful marketing practices. Further, in February 2009, CMS notified us that, effective March 7, 2009, we have been sanctioned through a suspension of marketing to Medicare beneficiaries and enrollments into all lines of our Medicare business. This suspension will remain in effect until CMS has determined that the suspension should be lifted. At this time, we cannot provide any assurances regarding the duration of the suspension and are evaluating the impact that it could have on our results of operations and our business. Nonetheless, we anticipate that our inability to perform marketing activities to, or enroll new Medicare members, as well as any actions that we take in response to the sanction, will have a material negative affect on our results of operations and business in 2009 and potentially beyond. Further, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to take appropriate corrective action or that, despite any corrective measures taken on our part, that we will not incur additional penalties, fines or other operating restrictions which could have an additional material adverse affect on our results of operations. In response to the CMS suspension in March 2009, we have made certain changes to our Medicare marketing sales force and are continuing to assess the impact of ceasing marketing activities and the resulting loss of membership to determine what effect, if any, this action will have on our staffing needs and other operational capabilities to effectively and efficiently meet the needs of the members we serve. Some of our contracts are also subject to termination or are only eligible for renewal through annual competitive bidding processes. For example, renewal of our PDP business is subject to an annual bidding process. As previously described, we bid above the CMS benchmark in 22 of the 34 CMS regions for plan year 2009 and are ineligible to receive auto-assigned members in these regions. As a result, 252,000 auto-assigned dual-eligible members were assigned away from our plans and approximately 28,000 low-income subsidized members disenrolled from our plans in January 2009. If we are unable to renew or to rebid or compete successfully for any of our existing or potential government contracts, if any of our contracts are terminated, or if any limitations or restrictions are imposed, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Our encounter data may be inaccurate or incomplete, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and ability to bid for, and continue to participate in, certain programs. We use administrative, claim and clinical data, known as encounter data, to identify members who may benefit from preventive or increased coordination of care or who otherwise need to maintain health status in association with a chronic condition or complex clinical situation. This data may also be aggregated and shared with specific health care providers to determine the effectiveness of care delivered to our members. We are required to report encounter data to our regulators who use the data to monitor what services we provide to our members, determine if services are being under- or over-utilized and evaluate the quality of the services we provide. To do so, our regulators compare our encounter data to certain defined quality metrics such as the Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS®) or unique metrics defined by the particular regulator. Our regulators may also use our encounter data, as well as data submitted by other health plans, to set reimbursement rates, assign membership, assess the quality of care being provided to members and evaluate contractual and regulatory compliance. For example, New York uses encounter data to measure and rate the quality of services health plans offer. Plans that score well on the quality measures as well as certain other performance standards are rewarded with additional premiums and auto-assigned members. Plans that fail to meet the standards for this additional premium and auto-assigned members, including established quality measures, for three consecutive years could be excluded from participation in the New York Medicaid program. Further, Florida has indicated a desire to implement a quality-based auto-assignment program by September 2009. The formula used to determine health plan assignment may utilize, in part, encounter data submissions. Failure by our providers to submit key data elements or to conform their submissions to required formats results in deficiencies in our encounter data. We are currently working closely with several states to ascertain or improve the accuracy or completeness of our encounter data. Where we have inaccurate or incomplete encounter data, we are required to expend additional effort to collect or correct this data and we are exposed to regulatory risk for noncompliance. We expect states to increase their reliance on encounter 24 Table of Contents data. Our inability to obtain, or submit in a timely manner, complete and accurate encounter data could significantly affect the premium rates we receive and how membership is assigned to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and ability to bid for, and continue to participate in, certain programs. Our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable are subject to greater variability when there is more limited claims payment experience or information available to us, which could cause our reported results of operations to be materially different than expected. The factors and assumptions that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited claims payment experience or information available to us. For example, from 2004 to 2008, we grew at a rapid pace, through the expansion of existing products and introduction of new products, such as Part D and PFFS, and entry into new geographic areas, such as Georgia. The ultimate claims payment amounts, patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas can not be precisely predicted at their onset, since we, the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas. Standard accepted actuarial methodologies require the use of key assumptions consisting of trend and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions that would allow for this inherent variability. This can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid. Medical cost trends can be volatile and management is required to use considerable judgment in the selection of medical benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs. Actual conditions, however, could differ from those assumed in the estimation process. Due to the uncertainties associated with the factors used in the assumptions discussed above, the actual amount of medical benefits expense that we incur may be materially different than the amount of medical benefits payable originally estimated. If our estimates of medical benefits payable are inaccurate in the future, our reported results of operations could be favorably or unfavorably impacted. Further, our inability to estimate medical benefits payable accurately may also materially adversely affect our ability to take timely corrective actions, further exacerbating the extent of any material adverse effect on our results of operations. Factors that may cause medical benefits expense to exceed our estimates include, among others:  lack of experience estimating medical benefits expense for new products and/or in new geographic areas;  an increase in the cost of health care services and supplies, including pharmaceuticals, whether as a result of inflation or otherwise;  higher than expected utilization of health care services;  periodic renegotiation of hospital, physician and other provider contracts;  the occurrence of catastrophes, major epidemics, terrorism or bio-terrorism;  changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them;  new mandated benefits or other changes in health care laws, regulations and/or practices; and  unanticipated adverse selection by high cost members. We manage our medical benefits expense through a variety of techniques, including various payment methods to primary care physicians and other providers, advance approval for hospital services and referral requirements, medical management and quality management programs, upgraded information systems and reinsurance arrangements. However, we may not be able to manage these expenses effectively in the future. For example, a hypothetical 1.0% increase in our medical benefits ratio (MBR), the ratio of our medical expenses to the premiums we receive and a measure of our profitability, would have reduced our earnings before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008 by approximately $53.0 million and $64.8 million, respectively. If our medical benefits expense increases, our profitability and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We derive a large portion of our Medicaid revenues and profits from operations in Florida and Georgia, and legislative or regulatory actions, economic conditions or other factors that materially adversely affect those operations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our Florida and Georgia Medicaid health plans accounted for approximately 32.7% and 41.0% of our total Medicaid segment premium revenues, respectively. If we are unable to continue to operate in Florida and Georgia, 25 Table of Contents if our current operations in Florida and Georgia are significantly curtailed, or either Florida or Georgia are unable or unwilling to pay current rates for Medicaid health plans, our revenues and profits will decrease materially. Our reliance on our Medicaid operations in Florida and Georgia could cause our revenues and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly, depending on legislative or regulatory actions, economic conditions and similar factors. For example, in 2009, Florida implemented Medicaid rates that made it economically unfeasible for us to continue to provide services in the Medicaid reform programs. As a result, we notified the State of Florida that we were withdrawing from these programs effective July 1, 2009, which will result in a loss of approximately 80,000 members. These recent and possible future rate reductions will require us to evaluate our medical benefits and administrative expenses. In Georgia, managed care legislation enacted on July 1, 2008 has resulted in program changes designed to address issues raised by health care providers during program implementation. These changes related to payment of claims, eligibility determination and provider contracting, and may negatively impact revenues and profits for the plan. Further, continued economic slowdowns in Florida and Georgia have negatively impacted state revenues. Consequently, in order to meet state budgetary requirements, Florida or Georgia or both may develop future Medicaid capitation rates that are insufficient to keep pace with our medical trends or inflation, therefore reducing our profitability in those markets and materially adversely affecting our results of operations. Similarly, although the U.S. Congress approved the childrens health bill which, among things, increases federal funding to the S-CHIP and President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that provides funding for, among other things, state Medicaid programs and aid to states to help defray budget cuts, because of the unsettled nature of these initiatives, the numerous steps required to implement them and the substantial amount of state flexibility for determining how Medicaid and S-CHIP funds will be used, we are currently unable to assess the ultimate impact that they will have on our business. It is possible that the ultimate impact of these initiatives could be negative. Negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The managed care industry historically has been subject to negative publicity. This publicity may result in increased legislation, regulation and review of industry practices and, in some cases, litigation. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and services, require us to change our products and services and increase regulatory or legal burdens under which we operate, further increasing the costs of doing business and materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The government agencies that regulate us can impose restrictions on our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, results of operations and cash flows. The government agencies that regulate us may limit or impose restrictions on us, or suspend our right to market to or add new members if it finds deficiencies in our provider network or operations, compliance violations or for other reasons. For example, during 2008, we were subject to a 60-day Medicaid marketing freeze in three counties in Florida resulting from the states allegation of wrongful marketing practices. Further, in February 2009, we were notified by CMS that, effective March 7, 2009, we have been sanctioned through a suspension of marketing to Medicare beneficiaries and enrollments into all lines of our Medicare business. This suspension will remain in effect until CMS has determined that it should be lifted. At this time, we cannot provide any assurances regarding the duration of the suspension and we are evaluating the impact that it could have on our results of operations and our business. Nonetheless, we anticipate that our inability to perform marketing activities to, or enroll new Medicare members, as well as any actions that we take in response to the sanction, will have a material negative affect on our results of operations and business in 2009 and potentially beyond. Further, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to take appropriate corrective action or that, despite any corrective measures taken on our part, that we will not incur additional penalties, fines or other operating restrictions which could have an additional material adverse affect on our results of operations. In response to the CMS suspension in March 2009, we made certain changes to our Medicare marketing sales force and are continuing to assess the impact of suspending marketing activities and the resulting loss of membership to determine what effect, if any, this action will have on our staffing needs and other operational capabilities to effectively and efficiently meet the needs of the members we serve. In addition, a governmental entity may take unilateral action to limit or suspend our ability to enter into additional contracts with that entity in the future, which could constrain our ability to expand our business. For example, in 2009 we terminated our contract with CMS to offer PPO plans in Georgia and, as a consequence, under the terms of our contract with CMS, we are not allowed to re-enter Georgia to offer PPO plans for a period of two years. When we enter new markets, regulators may place certain limitations on our license or may impose restrictions or additional requirements on our operations. For example, the North Carolina Department of Insurance imposed a limitation on the number of PFFS members we can enroll until we have operated in the state for a certain amount of time. Further, when we commenced operations in Ohio, the Ohio Department of Insurance required us to maintain 300% RBC, which is higher than would be required of a plan that had been operating in the state for a longer period of time. These limitations and additional requirements can restrict our ability to grow our membership in new markets and may require us to make additional capital contributions to new plans which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, cash flows and results of operations. 26 Table of Contents Because our premiums, which generate most of our revenues, are fixed by contract, we are unable to increase our premiums during the contract term if our corresponding medical benefits expense exceeds our estimates, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Most of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member. These payments are fixed by contract, and we are obligated during the contract period, which is generally one to four years, to provide or arrange for the provision of health care services as established by state and federal governments. We have less control over costs related to the provision of health care services than we do over our selling, general and administrative expense. Historically, our medical benefits expense as a percentage of premium revenue has fluctuated within a relatively narrow band. For example, our medical benefits expense was 81.1%, 79.4% and 85.3% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Further, our regulators set premiums using actuarial methods based on historical data. Actual experience, however, could differ from those assumed in the premium-setting process, which could result in premiums being insufficient to cover our medical benefits expense. If our medical benefits expense exceeds our estimates or our regulators actuarial pricing assumptions, we will be unable to adjust the premiums we receive under our current contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in our member mix may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, profitability and results of operations. Our revenues, costs and margins vary based on changes to our membership mix, product mix and the demographics of our membership. Our revenues are generally comprised of fixed payments that are determined by the type of member in our plans. The payments are generally set based on an estimation of the medical costs required to serve members with various demographic and health risk profiles. As such, there are sometimes wide variations in the established rates per member in both our Medicaid and Medicare lines of business. For instance, the rates we receive for a Medicaid ABD member are generally significantly higher than for a non-ABD member who is otherwise similarly situated. As the result of the previously described CMS suspension of marketing of, enrollments into, all lines of our Medicare business, we may encounter membership mix changes within our Medicare membership which could negatively impact our results of operations. As the composition of our membership base changes as the result of programmatic, competitive, regulatory, benefit design, economic or other changes, there is a corresponding change to our premium revenue, costs and margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, profitability and results of operations. Our failure to make acquisitions or divestitures on terms favorable to us, or at all, or to successfully integrate the businesses and product lines we acquire, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition to organic growth, acquisitions of other health plans remains an element of our growth strategy. However, the ongoing turmoil in the credit markets has made obtaining financing very challenging, and we may not have sufficient available cash to finance an acquisition. Therefore, we may be unable to identify, finance and complete appropriate acquisitions. Similarly, our ability to dispose of our assets may be hindered by our inability to find a suitable purchaser as the result of these market conditions, the pendency of the investigations and related matters or other factors. In addition to general market and financing risks, we are generally required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state or federal agencies when acquiring or disposing of a health plan, which may require a public hearing. We may be unable to comply with the regulatory requirements for an acquisition or disposition in a timely manner, or at all. Even if we identify suitable acquisition targets or purchasers for our assets, we may be unable to complete these types of transactions on terms favorable to us, or at all. Further, if we complete acquisitions, we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions because of operational factors or difficulties in integrating the acquisitions with our existing businesses. To the extent that we complete acquisitions, we are likely to incur additional costs or administrative challenges associated with entering into geographic areas in which we do not currently operate or expand into new lines of business. Our rate of expansion into other geographic areas or other product lines may also be inhibited by:  the time and costs associated with obtaining the necessary license to operate in the new geographic area or new line of business, if necessary;  our inability to develop a network of physicians, hospitals and other health care providers that meets our requirements and those of government regulators;  competition, which can increase the costs of recruiting members;  the cost of providing health care services in those geographic areas or lines of business; 27 Table of Contents  increased administrative and operational efforts and costs consequential to our establishing new operations for, or our inexperience with, a new line of business or geographic area; and  demographics and population density. Accordingly, we may be unsuccessful in entering other geographic areas, counties, states or lines of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The inability or failure to maintain effective and secure management information systems and applications, successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs could result in operational disruptions and other materially adverse consequences. Our business depends on effective and secure information systems, applications and operations. The information gathered, processed and stored by our management information systems assists us in, among other things, marketing and sales and membership tracking, underwriting, billing, claims processing, medical management, medical care cost and utilization trending, financial and management accounting, reporting, planning and analysis and e-commerce. These systems also support our customer services functions, provider and member administrative functions and support tracking and extensive analysis of medical expenses and outcome data. These systems remain subject to unexpected interruptions resulting from occurrences such as hardware failures or increased demand. There can be no assurance that such interruptions will not occur in the future, and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, operating and other issues can lead to data problems that affect the performance of important functions, including, but not limited to, claims payment, customer service and accurate financial reporting and customer service. There can also be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support our operations and improving service levels will not be delayed or that system issues will not arise in the future. Our information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs. If we are unable to maintain or expand our systems, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, such as the inability to pay claims or to make claims payments on a timely basis, loss of members, difficulty in attracting new members, regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses. Additionally, events outside our control, including acts of nature such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires or terrorism, could significantly impair our information systems and applications. To help ensure continued operations in the event that our primary data center operations are rendered inoperable, we have a disaster recovery plan that addresses how we recover to an acceptable level of business functionality within stated timelines. Due to ongoing document retention requirements, our ability to recover all business functionality in a timely manner may be impaired. Therefore, our disaster plan may not operate effectively during an actual disaster and our operations could be disrupted, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and client data stored in our information systems. Anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in services or operations. The Internet is a public network, and data is sent over this network from many sources. In the past, computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the Internet. Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems, or those of our providers or regulators, which could disrupt our operations, or make our systems inaccessible to our providers or regulators. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. Because of the confidential health information we store and transmit, security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation, fines and penalties, possible liability and loss. Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by cancellation of contracts and loss of members if such breaches are not prevented. We rely on a number of vendors, and failure of any one of the key vendors to perform in accordance with our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have contracted with a number of vendors to provide significant assistance in our operational support including, but not limited to, certain enrollment, billing, call center, benefit administration, claims processing functions, sales and marketing and certain aspects of utilization management. Our dependence on these vendors makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under our contracts with them. Significant failure by a vendor to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, due to our growth, business changes or legal proceedings, our ability to manage these vendors may be impacted. In addition, due to these factors, our vendors may request changes 28 Table of Contents in pricing, payment terms or other contractual obligations between the parties which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We encounter significant competition for program participation, network providers and members, and our failure to compete successfully may limit our ability to increase or maintain membership in the markets we serve, which may have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes due to business consolidations, changes in regulation that could affect competitors differently, new strategic alliances and aggressive marketing practices by other managed care organizations. We compete principally on the basis of premiums and cost-sharing terms, provider network composition, benefits and medical services provided, effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints, and other factors. For a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate, see Part I  Item 1  Business  Competition. A number of these competitive elements are partially dependent on, and can be positively affected, by financial resources available to a health plan. Many other organizations with which we compete have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Competitors with greater financial resources than us may be better positioned than us to withstand rate compression. Further, we operate in or may attempt to acquire business in programs or markets in which premiums are determined on the basis of a competitive bidding process. In these programs or markets, funding levels established by bidders with significantly different cost structures, target profitability margins or aggressive bidding strategies could negatively impact our ability to maintain or acquire profitable business which could hurt our results of operations. In addition, regulatory reform or other initiatives may bring additional competitors into our markets. Failure to compete successfully in the markets we serve may have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and results of operations. We may not be able to retain or effectively replace our executive officers, other members of management or associates, and the loss of any one or more members of management and their managed care expertise, or large numbers of associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although some of our officers have entered into employment agreements with us, these agreements may not provide sufficient incentives for those officers to continue their employment with us. The loss of the leadership, knowledge and experience of our management teams could have a material adverse effect on our business. Replacing one or more of the members of our management team might be difficult or take an extended period of time. We may not be able to retain our executive officers, other members of management or associates due to some limitations in our compensation arrangements. Historically, the focus of our compensation program has been on equity awards in the form of restricted stock and stock options. Following the commencement of the governmental investigations in October 2007 and the subsequent decline in our stock price, our ability to attract and retain our associates, including our executive officers, whether through equity awards or more generally, became more challenging. To address our retention issues, among other things, we implemented a retention program that expired at the end of 2008, and a severance program that will terminate at the end of 2009. The remaining severance program may not provide sufficient incentives to retain our officers and other associates and we have not established a new severance program to follow after the current program expires in 2009. Additionally, we have not established a similar retention program to replace the prior program that expired at the end of 2008 although we have implemented other programs that are designed to have a retentive affect. Our success is also dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified management, and technical and medical personnel. The pendency of the ongoing governmental investigations, litigation and related matters and any ongoing restrictions under which we must operate, such as a corporate integrity agreement or third party monitor, could hinder our ability to attract and retain qualified associates. Accordingly, all of these factors may impair our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not expect to sustain the rapid rate of growth we have achieved during the past five years, which could be viewed unfavorably by investors. Over the past five years we have experienced a rapid rate of growth in our business. We do not foresee growth at the same level of prior years primarily because (i) we believe that our historic rates of growth are unsustainable; (ii) at this time we do not foresee large, one-time opportunities to expand our business, such as the launch of PDPs and the privatization of Georgia Medicaid; and (iii) we intend to divert some resources to strengthen our compliance and operating capabilities. Furthermore, pressure on premium rates or margins could lead us to selectively exit some markets or products. For example, in 2008 we withdrew from the Ohio ABD program and in early 2009 we withdrew from the Florida Medicaid reform counties, in both cases because the premiums we received were insufficient to cover our medical expenses. Finally, recent regulatory changes designed to limit the use of direct and other marketing techniques could cause our rate of membership growth to decline. Accordingly, our business may experience a period of slower growth or contraction in 2009 and beyond, which may be viewed unfavorably by investors. Ineffective or unsuccessful management of our growth, either generally or with respect to specific products or geographic areas, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 29 Table of Contents We had total revenue of approximately $1.4 billion and $6.5 billion in 2004 and 2008, respectively. Management of our past and future potential growth, either generally or with respect to specific products or geographic areas, could place a significant strain on our management team and other resources. Our ability to manage our growth may depend on our ability to retain and strengthen our management team and attract, train and retain skilled associates, and our ability to implement and improve operational, financial and management information systems on a timely basis. We may need to enhance and augment our current systems and operating environment to ensure system and operational reliability as well as compliance with our current and future contracts. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the initial substantial costs related to growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with our providers, we may be precluded from operating in some markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to enter into cost-effective contracts with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers in appropriate numbers and at locations convenient for our members in each of the markets in which we operate. In any particular market, however, providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical benefits expense. In some markets, certain providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions. If such a provider or any of our other providers refused to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate contracts that might not be cost-effective or otherwise place us at a competitive disadvantage, those activities could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in that market. Also, in some rural areas, it is difficult to maintain a provider network sufficient to meet regulatory requirements. In the long term, our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will affect the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in that market. If we are unsuccessful in negotiating satisfactory contracts with our network providers, it could preclude us from renewing our Medicaid or Medicare contracts in those markets, from being able to enroll new members or from entering into new markets. Also, in situations where we have a deficiency in our provider network, regulators require us to allow members to obtain care from out-of-network providers at no additional cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage expenses. Our provider contracts with network primary care physicians and specialists generally have terms of one to four years, with automatic renewal for successive one-year terms. We may be unable to continue to renew such contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to serve our members profitably. We are also required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets. Further, under MIPPA, we are required to have a network of providers for all of our PFFS plans that operate in markets with two or more networked-based plans. Currently, we do not have provider networks in the majority of the markets where we offer PFFS plans. We are currently evaluating alternative solutions to establishing a network in targeted areas to meet these requirements, including building a contracted network, contracting with a third party network or withdrawing from certain counties where it is not economically or otherwise feasible to establish networks for this line of business. However, if we are unable to establish adequate networks, we will be required to cease offering PFFS plans in these areas. Finally, we may be unable to maintain our relationships with our network providers or enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or on favorable terms. If we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms, our results of operations and profitability could be materially adversely affected. Our inability to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property rights in our brand names for our health plans or enforce such rights may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to market our health plans under our brand names, including WellCare, HealthEase, Staywell, and Harmony. We hold a federal trademark registration for the WellCare trademark, and we are pursuing applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to register HealthEase and Harmony. We use the Staywell trademark only in the State of Florida, and, pursuant to an agreement in August 2008 with The Staywell Company, a health education company based in St. Paul, Minnesota, we will co-exist with their use of that term for very different kinds of services and will not pursue a federal registration of that trademark. It is possible that other businesses may have actual or purported rights in the same names or similar names to those under which we market our health plans, which could limit or prevent our ability to use these names, or our ability to prevent others from using these names. If we are unable to prevent others from using our brand names, if others prohibit us from using such names or if we incur significant costs to protect our intellectual property rights in such brand names, our business, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. Several members of our management team have been recently appointed to their positions, and a lack of familiarity with our Company or our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business. During the past year, our management team has undergone a number of changes, including the appointment of several members of senior management, some of whom have limited prior experience with our Company or our industry. Our operations are highly 30 Table of Contents dependent on the experience and skills of our management team. Our new managements team overall lack of familiarity and experience with the Company or our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure of our state regulators to approve payments of dividends and/or distributions from certain of our regulated subsidiaries to us or our non-regulated subsidiaries may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, business and financial condition. On December 31, 2008, three of our Florida regulated subsidiaries declared dividends to one of our non-regulated subsidiaries in the aggregate amount of $105.1 million, two of which were paid on December 31, 2008 and one of which was paid on January 2, 2009. In addition, we currently intend to cause certain of our other regulated subsidiaries to declare dividends and/or distributions to us or certain of our non-regulated subsidiaries in an effort to increase our unregulated cash balances. In most states, we are required to seek the prior approval of state regulatory authorities to transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries in excess of specified amounts or, in some states, any amount. The discretion of the state regulators, if any, in approving or disapproving a dividend or intercompany transaction is often not clearly defined. Health plans that declare non-extraordinary dividends usually must provide notice to the regulators in advance of the intended distribution date of such dividend. If our state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and/or distributions by certain of our regulated subsidiaries to us or our non-regulated subsidiaries, our liquidity, cash flows, business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Claims relating to medical malpractice and other litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. Our providers involved in medical care decisions and associates involved in coverage decisions may be exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims. Some states have passed or are considering legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations, or eliminates the requirement that providers carry a minimum amount of professional liability insurance. This kind of legislation has the effect of shifting the liability for medical decisions or adverse outcomes to the managed care organization. This could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or could cause us to pay additional premiums to increase our insurance coverage. Therefore, successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us, our providers or our associates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. From time to time, we are party to various other litigation matters (including the matters discussed in Part I  Item 3  Legal Proceedings), some of which seek monetary damages. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any pending litigation or potential future litigation, and we may incur substantial expense in defending these lawsuits or indemnifying third parties with respect to the results of such litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. We maintain errors and omissions policies as well as other insurance coverage. However, potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, our insurers may dispute coverage or may be unable to meet their obligations, or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future or that insurance will continue to be available to us on a cost-effective basis. Moreover, even if claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit, we would have to defend ourselves against such claims. The defense of any such actions may be time-consuming and costly and may distract our managements attention. As a result, we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business. Risks Related to Our Financial Condition Our senior secured credit facility, which is currently in default and subject to acceleration by the lenders, will become due and payable on May 13, 2009, and we cannot provide any assurances that adverse developments will not arise that would impede our ability to pay the outstanding balance of approximately $152.8 million when it becomes due. Our senior secured credit facility with Wachovia Bank, as Administrative Agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which has a term loan facility with an outstanding balance of approximately $152.8 million as of December 31, 2008, is currently in default and subject to acceleration by the lenders and, absent acceleration by the lenders, will become due and payable on May 13, 2009. Our senior secured credit facility also included a revolving credit facility that expired in May 2008. Although we are not in payment default, we are in default of a number of covenants contained in the credit agreement (including our failure to provide the lenders with audited financial statements, our budgets and other requested reports and information, and our inability to maintain certain leverage ratios), some of which cannot be cured prior to maturity of the senior secured credit facility (such as our entry into intercompany loan transactions, which are described in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, that were not effected in compliance with the credit agreement). As of the date hereof, our payment obligations under the credit agreement have not been accelerated and the rate of interest has not been increased. However, we cannot provide any assurance that such obligations will not be accelerated or the rate of interest increased in the future or that the lenders will not exercise other remedies for default. 31 Table of Contents We cannot provide any assurances that adverse developments will not arise that impede our ability to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility when it becomes due. In particular, the timing and amount of any potential resolution of pending investigations by the USAO, the Civil Division, the OIG and the State of Florida are uncertain and could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our near-term obligations, including repayment of the outstanding balance under the credit facility. Also, our ability to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility could be materially and adversely affected if, among other things, Florida regulators were to require certain of our intercompany loan arrangements which total approximately $50 million to be terminated. In addition, there may be other potential adverse developments that could impede our ability to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility. Based on third-party information, we believe that Fairholme Capital Management, L.L.C. (Fairholme), who also is our largest shareholder, has purchased approximately 67% of the outstanding balance under our term loan facility. As a holder of a majority of the outstanding balance under our term loan facility, Fairholme has the ability to require the exercise of remedies for default, including accelerating our payment obligations and/or increasing the rate of interest. If we are unsuccessful in our initiative to raise additional unregulated cash, our unregulated cash balances could deteriorate, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. We are pursuing financing alternatives to, among other things, increase our unregulated cash balances. Financing alternatives that we are pursuing include, but are not limited to, seeking dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to access available excess capital and pursuing external financing sources. One or more factors may cause us to be unable to raise additional unregulated cash, including, among others:  continued turmoil in the financial markets and general adverse economic conditions make it unlikely that we will be able to obtain financing and also may make it more difficult or prohibitively costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of debt or common stock;  the uncertainty created by the ongoing state and federal investigations is adversely affecting our ability to obtain financing;  required capital contributions to our regulated subsidiaries are greater than anticipated, resulting from, among other things, lower than expected profitability in our regulated subsidiaries or the imposition of greater capital requirements by state insurance regulators such as the recent request by one of our regulators to contribute a total of approximately $30.0 million in additional statutory capital into two of our HMOs;  we are unable to obtain the approval of state regulatory authorities to cause certain of our regulated subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends to us or our non-regulated subsidiaries;  management fees received by our non-regulated third-party administrator subsidiary are less than anticipated as a result of lower than expected premium revenues in our regulated subsidiaries;  the lenders under our senior secured credit facility accelerate repayment of the outstanding indebtedness thereunder;  Florida regulators require the regulated subsidiaries to terminate certain intercompany loan arrangements in the amount of $50.0 million, as discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, necessitating the borrowing subsidiary to repay in full the amount owed to the Florida regulated subsidiaries, or other restrictions are placed on the use of proceeds from such loans; and/or  we are required to pay significant fines or penalties in the near term to resolve one or more of the federal or state investigations or we do not prevail in one or more of the actions described under Part I  Item 3  Legal Proceedings. If we are unsuccessful in our initiative to raise additional unregulated cash, our unregulated cash balances could deteriorate, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business, financial condition and results of operations. Recent disruptions in the financial markets and the general economic slowdown could cause us to be unable to obtain financing and expose us to risks related to the overall macro-economic environment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 32 Table of Contents The United States equity and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many equities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing, even for companies who are otherwise qualified to obtain financing. These events make it unlikely that we will be able to obtain financing and also may make it more difficult or prohibitively costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of debt or common stock. In addition, due to the general economic slowdown, we may be exposed to risks related to the overall macro-economic environment, including a lower rate of return than we have historically experienced on our invested assets, being limited in our ability to sell or liquidate our invested assets, such as our auction rate securities, and receiving inadequate premium payments from our government payors due to state budget constraints. Such risks, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our significant debt obligations, the restrictions under which we operate as set forth in our senior secured credit facility, and our default status under our senior secured credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business strategy, liquidity and cash flow position. We have outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2008 of approximately $152.8 million under our senior secured credit facility. As noted above, our senior secured credit facility is currently in default and the lenders have the right to exercise remedies for default, including, among others, accelerating the amounts due under the credit facility, increasing the rate of interest and preventing us from accessing funds held by certain of our regulated subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, the lenders have not exercised any such remedies for default, but we cannot provide any assurance that they will not do so in the future. In the absence of the exercise of remedies by the lenders, our senior secured credit facility becomes due and payable on May 13, 2009. The required repayment of the outstanding balance will materially reduce our outstanding cash balances unless we are able to refinance this debt. Our current default status and near term obligation to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility also may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business strategy resulting from, among others, the following:  increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions, and placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors;  limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and  limiting our ability to fund capital expenditures, capital reserve requirements, acquisitions, and general, corporate and other operating purposes. In addition, restrictions and covenants in the documents governing our senior secured credit facility  including prescribed fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios and limitations on capital expenditures and acquisitions  may cause our financial and operating flexibility to be limited by, among other things, restricting our ability to (i) engage in certain transactions, (ii) incur liens, (iii) declare dividends to shareholders without lender approval, (iv) fund capital expenditures, capital reserve requirements, acquisitions, and general, corporate and other operating purposes, and (v) incurring indebtedness. Our failure to comply with covenants in our debt instruments could result in our indebtedness being immediately due and payable and the loss of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows. Our credit facility is secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of our non-regulated entities, which includes the stock of our regulated subsidiaries directly held by our non-regulated entities. If we fail to pay any of our indebtedness when due, or if we breach any of the other covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness, such as the obligation to provide the lenders audited financial statements, it may result in one or more events of default. As a result of the on-going investigations discussed in Note 11, the Company has been unable to satisfy a number of its obligations under the Credit Agreement, including providing audited financial statements, annual financial plans and other information sought by the lenders under the Credit Agreement. Consequently, since November 2007 the Company has been in technical default under the terms of this Credit Agreement. In addition, since September 30, 2008, the Company was in default of certain covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement requiring the Company to maintain certain leverage ratios. The Company continues to make payments as required, and consequently, there has been no payment default under the terms of the Credit Agreement. To date, the lenders have not accelerated any amounts outstanding under the credit facility, proceeded against the collateral securing the indebtedness or exercised other remedies, but we cannot assure you that they will not do 33 Table of Contents so in the future. If the lenders accelerate the amounts outstanding under the credit facility, proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness or exercise other remedies, our business, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Downgrades in our debt ratings may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, access to capital markets, and our ability to obtain alternative financing options. Claims paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of managed-care insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout our industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in promoting our services to certain of our constituents. Our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. Our ratings reflect each rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to providers. Downgrades in our ratings, should they occur, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, access to capital markets, and our ability to obtain alternative financing options. Our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. As of December, 31, 2008, all of our long-term investments were comprised of municipal note investments with an auction reset feature (auction rate securities). These notes are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans, public projects and other activities, which carry investment grade credit ratings. Liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually anywhere from seven to 35 days. Recently, auctions for some of these auction rate securities have failed and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven, 14, 28 or 35 days, as the case may be, until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, or they mature. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non-existent. We may be required to wait until market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to 31 years) to realize our investments recorded value. If the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments. Risks Related to Being a Regulated Entity CMSs risk adjustment payment system makes our revenue and profitability difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. CMS has implemented a risk adjustment payment system for Medicare health plans to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for Medicare plans to enroll and treat less healthy Medicare beneficiaries. CMSs risk adjustment model bases a portion of the total CMS reimbursement payments on various clinical and demographic factors including hospital inpatient diagnoses, diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings, including hospital outpatient facilities and physician visits, gender, age, and Medicaid eligibility. CMS requires all managed care companies to capture, collect, and report the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS. Because 100% of Medicare Advantage premiums are now risk-based, it is more difficult to predict with certainty our future revenue or profitability. In addition, CMS establishes premium payments to Medicare plans generally at the beginning of the calendar year and then adjusts premium levels on two separate occasions during the year on a retroactive basis. The first such adjustments update the risk scores for the current year based on prior years dates of service. The second such adjustment is a final retroactive risk premium settlement for the prior year. As a result of the variability of factors, including plan risk scores, that determine such estimates, the actual amount of CMSs retroactive payment could be materially more or less than our estimates. Consequently, our estimate of our plans risk scores for any period and our accrual of premiums related thereto may result in adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. On February 22, 2008, CMS published preliminary results of a study designed to assess the degree of coding pattern differences between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage and the extent to which any such differences could be appropriately addressed by an adjustment to risk scores. CMSs study of risk scores for Medicare populations from 2004 through 2006 found that 34 Table of Contents Medicare Advantage member risk scores increased substantially more than the risk scores for the general Medicare fee-for-service population. CMS found that the overall risk scores of stayers (a CMS term referring to those persons who were enrolled either in the same Medicare Advantage plan or in Original Medicare during the study periods) in Medicare Advantage increased more than those of Original Medicare stayers. Accordingly, in the 2009 Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year 2009 for Medicare Advantage Capitation Rates and Part D Payment Policies, CMS summarized findings from its analysis of risk scores over the 2004-2006 time period and proposed to apply a coding difference adjustment to contracts whose disease scores for stayers exceeded fee-for-service by twice the industry average. The agency proposed to apply an adjustment that was calculated based on those contracts that fell above the threshold. In response to the Advance Notice, CMS received a significant number of comments on the proposed adjustment for Medicare Advantage coding differences, most of which disagreed with the view that CMS had identified differences in coding patterns between Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service Medicare. CMS then decided not to make a coding intensity adjustment for 2009. On February 20, 2009, CMS published the 45-day advance notice for the 2010 preliminary rating methodology. For calendar year 2010, a negative coding intensity adjustment factor will apply to all managed care plans. Plans will receive final rates for 2010 in April 2009. If the coding intensity adjustment factor is implemented as proposed, this would result in a significant decrease in our Medicare revenues. Reductions in funding for government health care programs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. All of the health care services we offer are through government-sponsored programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare. As a result, our profitability is dependent, in large part, on continued funding for government health care programs at or above current levels. For example, the premium rates paid by each state to health plans like ours differ depending on a combination of factors such as upper payment limits established by the state and federal governments, a members health status, age, gender, county or region, benefit mix and member eligibility categories. Future Medicaid premium rate levels may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs or state and federal budgetary constraints. Some of the states in which we operate have experienced fiscal challenges leading to significant budget deficits. According to the National Association of State Budget Officers, Medicaid spending consumes approximately one-quarter of the average states budget, representing the second largest expenditure. Health care spending increases appear to be more limited than in the past, states continue to look at Medicaid programs as opportunities for budget savings and some states may find it difficult to continue paying current rates to Medicaid health plans. Changes in Medicaid funding may lead to reductions in the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for Medicaid, reductions in the amount of reimbursement or elimination of coverage for certain benefits such as pharmacy, behavioral health or other benefits. In some cases, changes in funding could be made retroactive, in which case we may be required to return premiums already received or receive reduced future payments. In the recent past, all of the states in which we operate have implemented or considered legislation or regulations that would reduce reimbursement rates, payment levels, benefits covered or the number of persons eligible for Medicaid. Reductions in Medicaid payments could reduce our profitability if we are unable to reduce our expenses at the same rate. Further, continued economic slowdowns in our markets have negatively impacted state revenues. The number of persons eligible to receive Medicaid benefits may grow more slowly or even decline more rapidly or in tandem with declining economic conditions. For example, the governments that oversee the Medicaid programs could choose to limit program eligibility in an effort to reduce the portion of their respective state budgets attributable to Medicaid, which would cause our membership and revenues to decrease. Therefore, declining general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease even further, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The states may also develop future Medicaid capitation rates that, while actuarially sound, are insufficient to keep pace with medical trends or inflation, therefore reducing our profitability in those markets and materially adversely affecting our results of operations. We are experiencing pressure on rates in Florida and Georgia, two states from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenue. In 2009, Florida implemented Medicaid rates that made it economically unfeasible for us to continue to participate in the Medicaid reform programs. As a result, we notified the State of Florida that we were withdrawing from these programs effective July 1, 2009, which will result in a loss of approximately 80,000 members. New legislation in Georgia related to payment of claims, eligibility determination and provider contracting, may negatively impact revenues and profits for the plan in 2009 and beyond. Further, continued economic slowdowns in Florida and Georgia, as well as other states, could result in additional state actions that could adversely affect our revenues. Similar to Medicaid, reductions in payments under Medicare or the other programs under which we offer health plans could likewise reduce our profitability. The MMA permits premium levels for certain Medicare plans to be established through competitive bidding, with Congress retaining the ability to limit increases in premium levels established through bidding from year to year. The federal government also has passed legislation that phases out Medicare Advantage budget neutrality payments through 2011, which impacts premium increases over that timeframe. The U.S. Congress is considering other reductions to rates or other changes to Medicare Part D which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. CMS recently announced preliminary 2010 Medicare Advantage payment rates which are between 4% and 5% below 2009 rates. Assuming the 20% physician rate cut implicit in the rates is not enacted, the following are among the events that are likely to occur: member benefits will be reduced; member 35 Table of Contents premiums will be increased; and margins will decline. These events are likely to have a negative affect on our 2010 operating results and membership. In January 2009, the new presidential administration took office. Although the new administration and recently elected U.S. Congress have expressed some support for measures intended to expand the number of citizens covered by health insurance and other changes within the health care system, the costs of implementing any of these proposals could be financed, in part, by reductions in the payments made to under Medicare and other government programs. Similarly, although the U.S. Congress approved the childrens health bill which, among things, increases federal funding to S-CHIP and President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that provides funding for, among other things, state Medicaid programs and aid to states to help defray budget cuts, because of the unsettled nature of these initiatives, the numerous steps required to implement them and the substantial amount of state flexibility for determining how Medicaid and S-CHIP funds will be used, we are currently unable to assess the ultimate impact that they will have on our business. We are subject to extensive government regulation, and any violation by us of applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is extensively regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate. The laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect health plan members and providers rather than stockholders. The government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude to enforce them. These laws and regulations, along with the terms of our government contracts, regulate how we do business, what services we offer, and how we interact with our members, providers and the public. Any violation by us of applicable laws and regulations could reduce our revenues and profitability, thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are subject to periodic reviews and audits under our contracts with state government agencies, and these audits could have adverse findings which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We contract with various governmental agencies to provide managed health care services. Pursuant to these contracts, we are subject to various reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse review, audit or investigation could result in:  forfeiture or recoupment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts;  imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, fines or other sanctions on us and/or our key associates;  loss of our right to participate in government-sponsored programs, including Medicaid and Medicare;  damage to our reputation in various markets;  increased difficulty in marketing our products and services;  inability to obtain approval for future service or geographic expansion; and  suspension or loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer, HMO or third party administrator or to otherwise provide a service. We are currently undergoing standard periodic audits by several Departments of Insurance and CMS to verify compliance with our contracts and applicable laws and regulations. In 2008, CMS completed its routine comprehensive audit of all of our Medicare operations. CMSs audit report indicates that we are deficient in a number of areas. We implemented corrective action plans to address CMSs findings, but in February 2009, CMS notified us that, effective March 7, 2009, we have been sanctioned through a suspension of marketing to Medicare beneficiaries and enrollments into all lines of our Medicare business. This suspension will remain in effect until CMS determines that the suspension should be lifted. Among other areas, CMSs decision was based on findings of deficiencies in our enrollment and disenrollment operations; appeals and grievances; timely and proper responses to beneficiary complaints and requests for assistance; and marketing and agent/broker oversight activities. We are working closely with CMS to address their concerns. At this time, we cannot provide any assurances regarding the duration of the suspension or the ultimate impact it will have on our results of operations and our business. Nonetheless, we anticipate that our inability to perform marketing activities to Medicare beneficiaries, or enroll new Medicare members into our plans, as well as any actions that we take in response to the sanctions, will have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and business in 2009 and potentially beyond. We are subject to laws and government regulations that may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of our Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into transactions favorable to shareholders. 36 Table of Contents We are subject to state laws regarding insurers and HMOs that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies that require prior regulatory approval for any change of control of an HMO or insurance subsidiary. For purposes of these laws, in most states control is presumed to exist when a person, group of persons or entity acquires the power to vote 10% or more of the voting securities of another entity, subject to certain exceptions. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of our Company, including through transactions, and in particular through unsolicited transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into transactions that some or all of our shareholders find favorable. We are subject to extensive fraud and abuse laws which may give rise to lawsuits and claims against us, the outcome of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Because we receive payments from federal and state governmental agencies, we are subject to various laws commonly referred to as fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which permit agencies and enforcement authorities to institute suit against us for violations and, in some cases, to seek treble damages, penalties and assessments. Liability under such federal and state statutes and regulations may arise if we know or it is found that we should have known that information we provide to form the basis for a claim for government payment is false or fraudulent, and some courts have permitted False Claims Act suits to proceed if the claimant was out of compliance with program requirements. Qui tam actions under federal and state law can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of health care companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid or other state or federal health care programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action. Many states, including states where we currently operate, have enacted parallel legislation. In a letter dated October 15, 2008, the Civil Division informed counsel to the Special Committee that as part of the pending civil inquiry, the Civil Division is investigating a number of qui tam complaints filed by relators against us under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. sections 3729-3733. The seal in those cases has been partially lifted for the purpose of authorizing the Civil Division to disclose to us the existence of the qui tam complaints. The complaints otherwise remain under seal as required by 31 U.S.C. section 3730(b)(3). We and the Special Committee are undertaking to discuss with the Civil Division, and address, allegations by the qui tam relators. We also learned from a docket search that a former employee filed a qui tam action on October 25, 2007 in state court for Leon County, Florida against several defendants, including us and one of our subsidiaries. Because qui tam actions brought under federal and state false claims acts are sealed by the court at the time of filing, we are unable to determine the nature of the allegations and, therefore, we do not know at this time whether this action relates to the subject matter of the federal investigations. It is possible that additional qui tam actions have been filed against us and are under seal. Thus, it is possible that we are subject to liability exposure under the False Claims Act, or similar state statutes, based on qui tam actions other than those discussed in this 2008 Form 10-K. We can give no assurances that we will not be subject to civil actions and enforcement proceedings under these federal and state statutes and regulations in the future. Any such claims, proceedings or violations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If state regulatory agencies require a higher statutory capital level for our existing operations or if we become subject to additional capital requirements, we may be required to make additional capital contributions to our regulated subsidiaries, which would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity. Our operations are conducted through licensed HMO and insurance subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital and maintenance of certain financial ratios, as defined by each state. One or more of these states may raise the statutory capital level from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity. For example, New York adopted regulations that increase the capital reserve requirement by 150% over an eight-year period. The phased-in increase in reserve requirements to which our New York plan is subject will, over time, materially increase our reserve requirements in New York. Other states may elect to adopt risk-based capital requirements based on guidelines adopted by the NAIC. As of December 31, 2008, our operations in Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri and Ohio, and our PDP and PFFS operations, were subject to such guidelines. Our subsidiaries also may be required to maintain higher levels of statutory net worth due to the adoption of risk-based capital requirements by other states in which we operate. Our subsidiaries are subject to their state regulators general oversight powers. Regardless of whether a state adopts the risk-based capital requirements, the states regulators can require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of amounts required under the applicable state laws if they determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interests of our members. In addition, as we continue to expand our plan offerings in new states or pursue new business opportunities, we may be required to make additional statutory capital contributions. In either case, any additional capital contribution made to one or more of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our 37 Table of Contents liquidity, cash flows and growth potential, which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy by, for example, hindering our ability to make debt service payments on amounts drawn from our credit facilities. In addition, increases of statutory capital requirements could cause us to withdraw from certain programs or markets where it becomes economically difficult to continue to be profitable. For example, we recently evaluated the capitalization requirement for our PFFS plans and determined that it was economically prudent to withdraw from participation in these plans in Texas, Florida and Wisconsin since the capital requirements for these states applied to the subsidiary as a whole, effectively increasing the capital requirements for several other states operating under the same license. If we restructure our insurance licenses for Florida, Texas and Wisconsin such that the capital requirements apply only to the business in those states, we may re-consider our interest in offering products in those states. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2009 we exited the PFFS business in these three states in which we provided services to approximately 10,000 members. Additionally, one or more of our regulators could require one or more of our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators were to determine that such a requirement were in the interest of our members. For example, a state regulator recently notified us that in its view, notwithstanding a parental guarantee that has been in place since 2006, two of our HMOs should contribute a total of approximately $30.0 million in additional statutory capital. We are currently discussing this request with the regulator. We derive a substantial portion of our Medicare revenues from our PDP operations, and legislative or regulatory actions, economic conditions, bidding results or other factors that adversely affect those PDP operations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. We derive a substantial portion of our Medicare revenues from our PDP operations. Our ability to operate our PDP plans profitably depends on our ability to attract members, to price our plans appropriately, to continue to develop core systems and processes, to manage our medical expenses related to these plans and other factors. We do not know whether we will be able to sustain our PDP operations profitability over the long-term, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. There are numerous factors that could have a materially adverse effect on our PDP operations, as well our Medicare Part D and other plans in general. Those that are particularly applicable to our PDP operations include:  Risk corridors: The MMA provides for risk corridors that are designed to limit to some extent the losses PDP plans would incur if the medical expenses exceed the reimbursement to be received from CMS. These risk corridors are designed to widen over time. The risk corridors for 2006 and 2007 provided more protection against excess losses than are available for 2008 and future years as the thresholds increase and the reimbursement percentages decrease. Reimbursement or other reconciliations from CMS could be delayed, which could cause us to incur more up-front costs for operating the program.  Annual Bidding: Along with other Part D plans, including PDPs and MA-PDs, we bid on Part D benefits in June each year. Based on the bids submitted, CMS establishes a national benchmark. Plans that bid below the benchmark are eligible to have members automatically assigned to them. Consequently, our ability to bid below the benchmark impacts our ability to receive automatically assigned members. As previously described, we bid above the CMS benchmark in 22 of the 34 CMS regions for plan year 2009 and are ineligible to receive auto-assigned members in these regions. As a result, 252,000 auto-assigned dual-eligible members were assigned away from our plans and approximately 28,000 low-income subsidized members disenrolled from our plans in January 2009.  Competition: We have encountered competition from other PDP plans, some of which may have significantly greater resources and brand recognition than we do, and new PDP plans are entering the business. During the annual bidding process described above, we compete with other plans to bid below the CMS benchmark for auto-assigned members. During the annual open-enrollment period, we compete with other PDP plans to obtain members who can select their PDP plan. We cannot predict whether we will be able to continue to compete effectively in this market. Those factors that apply to all of our Medicare plans, including PDP and Part D, include:  Membership: Medicare beneficiaries who are dual-eligibles generally are able to disenroll and choose another PDP plan at any time, and certain other Medicare beneficiaries also may have a limited ability to disenroll from the plan they initially select and choose a different PDP plan. All Medicare beneficiaries are able to change PDP plans during the annual open enrollment period. We may not be able to retain the auto-assigned members or those members who affirmatively choose our PDP plans, and we may not be able to attract new PDP members.  Benefits expense: We may experience higher benefits expense as a result of an increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals, possible changes in our pharmacy rebate program with drug manufacturers, higher than expected utilization and new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase our costs. 38 Table of Contents  Regulatory and administration: CMS may alter the Medicare Part D program in a manner that could be detrimental to us.  Utilization of benefits: We make actuarial assumptions about the utilization of benefits in our PDP plans. Because our membership mix changes in this program from year to year, our assumptions are based on data that may not be applicable to our current PDP membership base and we cannot assure you that these assumptions will prove to be correct or that premiums will be sufficient to cover the benefits provided. Several changes to the Medicare program resulting from the MIPPA legislation that became effective in 2008 could increase competition for our existing and prospective members and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. On July 15, 2008, MIPPA became law and in September 2008 CMS promulgated enabling regulations. MIPPA impacts a broad range of Medicare activities and impacts all types of Medicare managed care plans. All of the changes imposed on us by MIPPA, including those discussed below, have the potential to cause us to incur additional administrative expense, lose membership and ultimately reduce our Medicare revenues, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations: PFFS plans: MIPPA revises requirements for Medicare Advantage PFFS plans, which may have the effect of ending some of these plans in plan year 2011 where such plans are not able to comply with these new requirements. In particular, MIPPA requires all PFFS plans that operate in markets with two or more networked-based plans must be offered on a networked basis. Currently, we do not have provider networks in the majority of the markets where we offer PFFS plans. We are currently evaluating alternative solutions to establishing a network in targeted areas to meet these requirements, including building a contracted network, contracting with a third party network or withdrawing from certain counties where it is not economically or otherwise feasible to establish networks for this line of business. Sales and Marketing: MIPPA places prohibitions and limitations on specified sales and marketing activities under Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans. Among other things, Medicare plans are no longer permitted to make unsolicited contact with potential members by way of outbound telemarketing and community marketing, offer other types of Medicare products to existing members, provide meals to potential enrollees or approach potential members in common or public areas. These changes are likely to increase our administrative costs of enrolling an individual, and could increase the risk of compliance violations and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enroll new Medicare members particularly because we have historically relied to a large extent on outbound telemarketing and community marketing to sell our products. Although we utilized alternative marketing methods during the most recent Medicare enrollment period, we are continuing to evaluate and assess how these MIPPA changes will affect our ability to obtain Medicare Advantage members and how we will use the most effective alternative marketing methods allowed under MIPPA to educate potential members regarding our products and services. Special Needs Plans: A significant portion of our coordinated care plan membership is enrolled in our D-SNPs. Under MIPPA, D-SNPs such as ours are required to contract with state Medicaid agencies to coordinate benefits. The scope of the D-SNP contract with the state Medicaid agency will depend greatly on what eligibility categories, cost-sharing responsibilities and payment limitations each state has included in its state plan. The contracting process under MIPPA provides an opportunity for D-SNPs and states to improve the coordination of benefits, including defining the overlap between Medicaid and Medicare benefits, eligibility verification processes, payment and coverage responsibilities, marketing and enrollment standards, appeals and grievances procedures and other important operational considerations. Collaboration between states and D-SNPs is expected to create administrative efficiencies and improve beneficiary health outcomes. However, the requirement to contract with state Medicaid agencies imposes potential risk for D-SNP providers such as us because MIPPA does not allow expansion in 2010 or continued operation of a D-SNP after 2010 if a state and the D-SNP provider cannot come to agreement on terms. Compensation: MIPPA also establishes limits on agent and broker compensation. The CMS implementing regulations require that plans that pay commissions do so by paying for an initial year commission and residual commissions for each of the five subsequent renewal years, thereby creating a six year commission cycle for members moving from Original Medicare and a five year commission cycle for members moving from another Medicare Advantage plan. Reductions or delays in federal and state funding for health care programs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. The federal government and many states from time to time consider reducing the level of funding for government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. For example, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, signed into law on February 8, 2006, includes reductions in federal Medicaid spending by approximately $4.8 billion and reductions to Medicare spending by approximately $6.4 billion over a period of five years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Act reduces spending by cutting Medicaid payments for prescription drugs and 39 Table of Contents gives states new power to reduce or reconfigure benefits. This law may also lead to lower Medicaid reimbursements in some states. States also periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for Medicaid and other programs. In recent years, the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict Medicaid and other health care programs costs and eligibility. Changes to Medicaid and other health care programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our administrative or health care costs under those programs, all of which could have a negative impact on our business. We believe that reductions in Medicaid and other health care program payments could substantially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds; such cancellations could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations. Premiums are contractually payable to us before or during the month for services that we are obligated to provide to our members. Our cash flow would be negatively impacted if premium payments are delayed or not made according to contract terms. Our contracts with the states in which we operate are subject to cancellation by the state in the event of inadequate program funding contained within such states budget, and are also subject to decreases or limited increases in premiums, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and free cash available for operations and capital reserve requirements. If a state in which we operate approves a budget that includes inadequate program funding, our contracts with that state are subject to cancellation by the state. In some jurisdictions, such cancellation may be immediate and in other jurisdictions a notice period is required. State governments generally are experiencing tight budgetary conditions within their Medicaid programs. Budget problems in the states in which we operate could result in decreases or limited increases in the premiums paid to us by the states. In some instances, it may result in the postponement of payment until additional funding sources are available. For example and as described above, in February 2009, we determined that it was economically unfeasible for us to continue participating in the Medicaid reform program after Florida notified us that it was reducing our reimbursement rates. Consequently, we notified the State of Florida that we were withdrawing from the Medicaid Reform program effective July 1, 2009, which will result in a loss of approximately 80,000 members. If any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us, or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends, it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and free cash available for operations and capital reserve requirements. We are required to comply with laws governing the transmission, security and privacy of health information, and we have not yet determined what our total compliance costs will be; however, such costs, when determined, could be more than anticipated, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Regulations under HIPAA require us to comply with standards regarding the exchange of health information within our company and with third parties, such as health care providers, business associates and our members. These regulations include standards for common health care transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, and payment information; unique identifiers for providers and employers; security; privacy; and enforcement. HIPAA also provides that to the extent that state laws impose stricter privacy standards than HIPAA privacy regulations, a state seeks and receives an exception from the Department of Health and Human Services regarding certain state laws, or state laws concern certain specified areas, such state standards and laws will not be preempted. We have implemented and are continuing to implement security policies and procedures to strive to achieve and maintain compliance with the security standards. Given HIPAAs complexity and the possibility that the regulations may change and may be subject to changing and perhaps conflicting interpretation, our ongoing ability to comply with any of the HIPAA requirements is uncertain. Furthermore, a states ability to promulgate stricter laws, and uncertainty regarding many aspects of such state requirements, make compliance with applicable health information laws more difficult. Normal health plan operations require that we transmit protected health information via electronic or other means, often at the direction of and based on information provided by third parties, such as our providers, that could result in inadvertent violations of HIPAA privacy or security rules. In March 2008, management learned that, in accordance with a contractual requirement, a Company web developer had transmitted a document folder containing reports for the Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH) to two production ports, one of which, unbeknownst to the web developer, was not secure. Consequently, data, including protected information, unintentionally was made accessible through the Internet. We incurred considerable remediation expenses in this matter and, on June 11, 2008, we paid $725,000 in response to a Notification of Breach and Assessment of Liquidated Damages issued by DCH. Our efforts to comply with HIPAA and to remediate any violations of HIPAA, including any fines and penalties, could cause us to incur substantial costs which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations. 40 Table of Contents Future changes in health care law may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Health care laws and regulations, and their interpretations, are subject to frequent change. Changes in existing laws or regulations, or their interpretations, or the enactment of new laws or the issuance of new regulations could materially reduce our profitability, among other things, by:  imposing additional license, registration and/or capital requirements;  increasing our administrative and other costs;  requiring us to undergo a corporate restructuring;  increasing mandated benefits;  limiting our ability to engage in intra-company transactions with our affiliates and subsidiaries;  requiring us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of our providers;  restricting our revenue and enrollment growth;  requiring us to restructure our relationships with providers; or  requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems. Changes in state law, regulations and rules also may materially adversely affect our profitability. Requirements relating to managed care consumer protection standards, including increased plan information disclosure, limits to premium increases, expedited appeals and grievance procedures, third party review of certain medical decisions, health plan liability, access to specialists, clean claim payment timing, physician collective bargaining rights and confidentiality of medical records either have been enacted or continue to be under discussion. New health care reform legislation may require us to change the way we operate our business, which may be costly. Further, although we strive to exercise care in structuring our operations to attempt to comply in all material respects with the laws and regulations applicable to us, government officials charged with responsibility for enforcing such laws and/or regulations have in the past asserted and may in the future assert that we or transactions in which we are involved are in violation of these laws, or courts may ultimately interpret such laws in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation. Therefore, it is possible that future legislation and regulation and the interpretation of laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate under the Medicaid, Medicare and S-CHIP programs and to continue to serve our members and attract new members, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. State regulatory restrictions on our marketing activities may constrain our membership growth and our ability to increase our revenues, which could have a material adverse effect in our results of operations. Although we enroll some of our new members through automatic enrollment programs and voluntary member enrollment, we rely on our marketing and sales efforts for a significant portion of our membership growth. All of the states in which we currently operate permit advertising and, in most cases, direct sales but impose strict requirements and limitations as to the types of marketing activities that are permitted. For example, in Florida, we were recently subject to a 60-day marketing freeze in three counties resulting from the states allegation of wrongful marketing practices. In addition, the State of Georgia does not permit direct sales by Medicaid health plans. In Georgia, we advertise our plans, but we rely on member selection and auto-assignment of Medicaid members into our plans. Effective January 1, 2009, all plans participating in the Florida Medicaid program are prohibited from directly selling their plans to Medicaid recipients. In circumstances where our marketing efforts are prohibited or curtailed, we may incur additional administrative expense in trying to obtain members and our ability to increase or sustain membership could be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If a state fails to renew its federal waiver application for mandated Medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied, our membership in that state will likely decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A significant percentage of our Medicaid plan enrollment results from mandatory Medicaid enrollment in managed care plans. States may mandate Medicaid enrollment into managed care through CMS-approved plan amendments or, for certain groups, through federal waivers or demonstrations. Waivers and programs under demonstrations are generally approved for two- to five-year periods, and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies and the waiver request is approved or renewed by CMS. We have no control over this renewal process. If a state in which we operate does not mandate managed care enrollment in its state 41 Table of Contents plan or does not renew an existing managed care waiver, our membership would likely decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by the government to collect premiums, and any inaccuracies in those lists cause states to recoup premium payments from us, which could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. Premium payments that we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by the government. From time to time, states require us to reimburse them for premiums that we received from the states based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who were not eligible for any government-sponsored program or have been enrolled twice in the same program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program. For example, in July 2008, we continued to receive premiums from the State of Florida for members that had become eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Once a recipient becomes dually eligible, their premium is primarily remitted by CMS rather than the State. In this case, the State of Florida had not properly reduced the amount of premium they paid to us to reflect that CMS was now the primary payor. Our review of all remittance files to identify potential duplicate members, members that should be terminated and members for which we have been paid an incorrect rate may not identify all such members. In addition to recoupment of premiums previously paid, we also face the risk that a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment. Our profitability would be reduced as a result of the states failure to pay us for related payments to providers we made and we were unable to recoup such payments from the providers. We have established a reserve in anticipation of recoupment by the states of previously paid premiums, but ultimately our reserve may not be sufficient to cover the amount, if any, of recoupments. If the amount of any recoupments exceeds our reserves, our revenues and profits could be materially reduced and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our failure to maintain accreditations could disqualify us from participation in the certain state Medicaid programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Several of our Medicaid contracts require that our plans or subcontracted providers be accredited by independent accrediting organizations that are focused on improving the quality of health care services. Accreditation by AAAHC or comparable accreditation is a requirement for participation in the Florida Medicaid program. Further, Florida Medicaid plans can only subcontract behavioral health services to a URAC-accredited organization. Accreditation by NCQA is a requirement for participation in the Georgia Medicaid managed care program and the Hawaii Medicaid program requires that participating plans be either NCQA or URAC accredited. Our Florida health plans are accredited by the AAAHC and our behavioral health subsidiary to which we subcontract behavioral health services is accredited by URAC. In July 2008, as required by the terms of our Medicaid contract, our Georgia health plan was awarded accredited status by NCQA. Under the terms of our Medicaid contract, we have until January 1, 2012 to obtain NCQA accreditation in Hawaii. Failure to maintain our AAAHC or URAC accreditations in Florida or NCQA accreditation in Georgia could disqualify us from participation in the Florida and Georgia Medicaid businesses, respectively. Similarly, failure to obtain NCQA accreditation in Hawaii by January 1, 2012 could disqualify us from participation in the Hawaii Medicaid program. There can be no assurance that we will maintain, or obtain, our NCQA, URAC or AAAHC accreditations, and the loss of, or failure to obtain, these accreditations could adversely our ability to participate in certain Medicaid programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Future sales, or the availability for sale, of our common stock may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect the market price of our common stock and could materially impair our future ability to raise capital through offerings of our common stock. As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding options to purchase 4,278,118 shares of our common stock, of which 1,463,630 were exercisable, at a weighted average exercise price of $39.26 per share. From time to time, we may issue additional options to associates, non-employee directors, consultants and others pursuant to our equity incentive plans. 42 Table of Contents The provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and make it more difficult for a stockholder to elect directors of its choosing. The provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and provisions of applicable Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests, make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions that stockholders may consider unfavorable. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. By letter dated October 25, 2007, the SECs Division of Corporation Finance provided us with comments relating to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 filed by us on February 17, 2007. The SECs comments relate principally to our disclosures regarding our Medicare Part D business. We believe that our disclosures were appropriate, although we agreed to provide additional disclosure in future filings. We responded to this letter on November 16, 2007. To date, we have not received a response to our November 16, 2007 letter.
