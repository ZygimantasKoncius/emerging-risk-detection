D. Trend Information Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that caused the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions. E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. In addition, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. Furthermore, we do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. Authoritative pronouncement regarding consolidation of variable-interest entities requires a variable-interest entity to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of such entity. An entity is considered to be a variable-interest entity if certain conditions are present, including where the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. As a result of our various agreements with Hongcheng Education and its respective shareholders, we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of Hongcheng Education and all its subsidiaries. The financial statements of Hongcheng Education and all its subsidiaries have been consolidated into our financial statements. All significant transactions and balances between us, our subsidiaries, Hongcheng Education and all its subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation. F. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2013.

Compensation Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers For the year ended December 31, 2013, we paid aggregate cash compensation of approximately RMB8.4 million ($1.4 million) to our executive officers as a group.

We paid aggregate cash compensation of approximately RMB0.2 million in 2013to our three independent directors for their services as directors. We did not provide any non-cash compensation to our non-executive or independent directors in 2013. Stock-Based Compensation Plans We amended our Equity Incentive Plan, or Amended Equity Incentive Plan, by a written resolution adopted by our compensation committee on August 18, 2010. Our Amended Equity Incentive Plan changed the annual increase in number of shares available for issuance under the equity incentive plan from 2% of our outstanding shares as of December 31st of the preceding year to 2.5% of the same. The other terms of the Amended Equity Incentive plan remain unchanged. The Amended Equity Incentive Plan provides for the grant of options as well as restricted shares and RSUs, referred to as awards. The purpose of the plan is to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, provide additional incentive to employees, directors and consultants, and promote the success of our business. Administration. The compensation committee of our board of directors will administer the plan. Subject to the provisions of the Amended Equity Incentive Plan, the compensation committee has the authority, in its sole discretion to, among other things, amend or modify outstanding awards under the plan, only in ways that will not be adverse to the award/option holder, including, without limitation, the re-pricing of options with an exercise price that is higher than the current trading price of our shares, or underwater options, or the replacement of an option with cash or other award type that would be treated as a re-pricing under the rules of the stock exchange on which the shares are listed. In addition, our shareholders also approved an amendment to the plan that eliminated the requirement that subsequent amendments to the Amended Equity Incentive Plan be submitted for shareholder approval (to the extent such shareholder approval would have been required under the stock exchange on which our securities are listed). Option Terms. Share options granted under our Amended Equity Incentive Plan may be incentive share options, or ISOs, which are intended to qualify for favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment under the provisions of Section 422 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or non-qualified share options, or NSOs, which do not so qualify. Under our Amended Equity Incentive Plan, the exercise price of ISOs cannot be less than the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the date of grant. However, in the case of an ISO granted to a grantee who at the time of grant owned shares possessing more than 10.0% of the combined voting power of all classes of our share capital (including any equity of any of our PRC subsidiaries), the option price may not be less than 110.0% of the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the date of grant of such ISO and the option period may not be greater than five years from the date of grant. The exercise price for NSOs is determined by the board of directors but may not be less than the fair market value of ordinary shares on the date of grant. 90 Table of Contents Eligibility. Under our Amended Equity Incentive Plan, awards may be issued to employees, non-employee directors or consultants of our company or our PRC subsidiaries, although ISOs may only be issued to our employees or the employees of our PRC subsidiaries. Option Exercise and Termination of Awards. Share options granted under the plan may be exercised within the option period specified by our board of directors or the compensation committee (after it is established), which shall not be more than ten years from the date of option grant. If an option holders service terminates due to the option holders death or disability, the unvested portion of a share option is forfeited and the vested portion is still exercisable for a period of one year following the option holders death or disability or until the expiration of the option period (if sooner). If an option holders service ends for reasons other than death or disability, the unvested portion of a share option will be forfeited and the vested portion will be exercisable for a period of ninety days following the option holders termination or until the expiration of the option period (if sooner). Awards of restricted stock or RSUs that are unvested will be forfeited at the time of termination of service. Third-Party Acquisition. If a third party acquires us through a merger or consolidation transaction in which we are not the surviving corporation, all outstanding share options will be substituted by the surviving or resulting corporation. We are authorized to cancel any outstanding options upon the effective date of any such transaction, provided that we notify each option holder of our intention to do so at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the transaction and permit the optionees to exercise their options in full during this period. We are also authorized to cancel any outstanding awards and pay or deliver to the holder an amount in cash or securities having a value equal to the formula or fixed price per share paid to shareholders in the case of restricted stock or RSUs. In the case of options, the holder will receive an amount equal to the product of the number of shares subject to the option multiplied by the amount, if any, by which the formula or fixed price per share paid to shareholders in the transaction exceeds the option exercise price applicable to such award. Amendment and Termination of Plan. Our board of directors may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the Amended Equity Incentive Plan without shareholder approval. However, any amendment, suspension or termination of the plan may not adversely affect awards already granted without consent of the recipient of such awards. Unless terminated earlier, the Amended Equity Incentive Plan shall continue in effect for a term of ten years from the date of adoption. As of April 22, 2014, our board of directors has authorized the issuance of up to 20,277,961 ordinary shares upon exercise of awards granted under our equity incentive plan, with an increase each year equal to 2.5% of the outstanding number of shares as of the immediately preceding year ended December 31.

Under Cayman Islands law, English common law is of persuasive authority before the Cayman Islands courts and they would ordinarily be expected to follow English case law precedents which permit a minority shareholder to commence a representative action against or derivative actions in the name of the company to challenge (a) an act which is ultra vires the company or illegal; (b) an act which constitutes a fraud against the minority and the wrongdoers are themselves in control of the company;(c) an act which is an infringement of individual rights of shareholders; and (d) an irregularity in the passing of a resolution which requires a qualified (or special) majority. Subject to the provisions of our amended and restated articles of association (as amended) and the Companies Law (Law 3 of 1961, as consolidated and revised) of the Cayman Islands, hereinafter referred to as the Companies Law, the functions and powers of our board of directors include, among others: · managing the business and affairs of our company in the interest, and for the benefit, of our shareholders as a whole in order to enhance shareholder value over the long term; · exercising its business judgment to act in a manner which it reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our company and shareholders as a whole consistent with its fiduciary duties; · reviewing and, where appropriate, approving our major strategic, financial and business objectives, plans and actions; · establishing policies and principles for the selection, and possible succession planning, of directors, the chief executive officer and other senior management officers; · convening our annual general meetings and reporting its work to shareholders at such meetings; · declaring dividends and distributions; · appointing officers and determining the term of office of the officers; · exercising the borrowing powers of our company and mortgaging the property of our company; and · approving the transfer of shares in our company, including the registering of such shares in our share register. Interested Transactions Following a declaration being made pursuant to our fifth amended and restated articles of association (as amended), subject to any separate requirement for any audit committee approval under applicable law or the listing rules of the National Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., and unless disqualified by the chairman of the relevant board meeting, a director may vote in respect of any contract or proposed contract or arrangement in which such director is interested and may be counted in the quorum at such meeting. 94 Table of Contents Remuneration and Borrowing The directors shall receive remuneration as the board may from time to time determine. Each director shall be entitled to be repaid or prepaid all traveling, hotel and incidental expenses reasonably incurred or expected to incurred by him in attending meetings of the board or committees of the board or general meetings or separate meetings of any class of shares or of debenture of our company or otherwise in connection with the discharge of his duties as a director. The ordinary remuneration of the directors shall from time to time be determined by our company in general meeting and shall (unless otherwise directed by the resolutions by which it is voted) be divided amongst the board in such proportions and in such manner as the board of directors may agree or, failing agreement, equally, except that any director who shall hold office for part only of the period in respect of which such remuneration is payable shall be entitled only to rank in such division for a proportion of remuneration related to the period during which has held office. The compensation committee will assist the directors in reviewing and approving the compensation structure for the directors. Subject to our fifth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (as amended), the directors may exercise all the powers of our company to raise or borrow money and to mortgage or charge all or any part of our undertaking, property and assets (present and future) and uncalled capital of our company and, subject to the Companies Law, to issue debentures, bonds and other securities whether outright or as security for any debt, liability or obligation of our company or of any third party. Qualification A director is not required to hold any shares in our company in order to serve as a director. Terms of Directors and Executive Officers At each annual general meeting of our company, one-fourth of our directors for the time being (or if their number is not a multiple of four, the number nearest to but not greater than one-fourth) shall retire from office by rotation provided that the chairman of the board and/or the managing director of our company shall not, whilst holding such office, be subject to retirement by rotation or be taken into account in determining the number of directors to retire in each year. Notwithstanding the above and the provision under article 86(5) of our amended and restated articles of association (as amended), during any period from the date of an annual general meeting (including such date) to the date of the next annual general meeting (excluding such date), the total number of directors who retire by rotation or are removed from office pursuant to article 86(5) shall not be greater than one-third of the number of directors (or if their number is not a multiple of three, the number nearest to but not greater than one-third). A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election. The service agreements for each of the directors do not provide for any special termination or severance benefits beyond what is required under the relevant laws of the PRC, nor do we have other arrangements with our directors regarding such matters.
