ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves various risks. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we deem currently to be material, and do not represent all of the risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider material may in the future become material and impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be materially harmed, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes, and in our other periodic filings with the SEC. Our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the following: 14 Table of Contents Risks Related to our Business We have a history of losses and may not be profitable in the future. Prior to November 9, 2010, our historical combined financial data was carved-out from the financial information of GGP. This data shows that had we been a stand-alone company, we would have had a history of losses. We cannot assure you that we will achieve sustained profitability going forward. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we incurred losses from continuing operations of $702.9 million and $17.9 million, respectively. Further, we have incurred losses from continuing operations subsequent to our spin-off from GGP due to significant impairment losses (due to revised operating strategies for certain of our assets) and warrant liability expenses related to the plan to emerge from bankruptcy and our new management team. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, net cash used in operating activities was $67.9 million, $17.9 million and $50.7 million, respectively. If we cannot improve our profitability or generate positive cash from our operating activities, the trading value of our common stock may decline. We have minimal operating history as an independent company upon which investors can evaluate our performance, and accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks that any newly independent public company encounters. We completed our spin-off from GGP on November 9, 2010, and have minimal experience operating as an independent public company and performing various corporate functions, including human resources, tax administration, legal (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and with the periodic reporting obligations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the Exchange Act), treasury administration, investor relations, internal audit, insurance, information technology and telecommunications services, as well as the accounting for items such as equity compensation and income taxes. Our business is subject to the substantial risks inherent in the commencement of a new business enterprise in an intensely competitive industry. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in the early stages of independent business operations, particularly companies that are heavily affected by economic conditions and operate in highly competitive environments. We may face potential difficulties in obtaining operating and development capital. The successful execution of our business strategy will require us to obtain substantial amounts of operating and development capital. Sources of such capital could include bank borrowings, public and private offerings of debt or equity, sale of certain assets and joint ventures with one or more third parties. In recent years, it has been difficult for companies with substantial profitable operating histories to source capital for real estate development and acquisition projects, as well as basic working capital needs. We may find it difficult or impossible to acquire cost-effective capital to implement our business strategy because of our limited operating history as a stand-alone company and poor economic conditions. Our ability to operate our business effectively may suffer if we do not establish our own financial, administrative and other support functions to operate as a stand-alone company. Prior to our spin-off from GGP, we relied on the financial, administrative and other support functions of GGP to operate our business and we continue to rely on GGP for these and other vital services on a transitional basis pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement that we entered into with GGP in connection with the spin-off. We also needed to rapidly establish our own accounting policies and internal controls over financial accounting. As a result of our spin-off, we became subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP for filing with the SEC. In addition, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we, among other things, 15 Table of Contents establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and disclosure purposes. We may not be successful in identifying and establishing the requisite controls and procedures. In addition, establishing and monitoring these controls could result in significant costs to us and require us to divert substantial resources, including management time, from other activities. Any failure in our own financial or administrative policies and systems could impact our financial performance and could materially harm our business and financial performance. We may be unable to develop and expand our properties in our Strategic Developments segment. Our business objective in our Strategic Developments segment is to develop and redevelop our properties, which we may be unable to do if we do not have or cannot obtain sufficient capital to proceed with planned development, redevelopment or expansion activities. In addition, the construction costs of a project, including labor and materials may exceed original estimates or available financings. We may be unable to obtain zoning, governmental permits and authorizations or anchor store, mortgage lender and property partner approvals that are required for any such development, redevelopment or expansion. We may abandon redevelopment or expansion activities already under way which we are unable to complete, which may result in additional cost recognition. In addition, if redevelopment, expansion or reinvestment projects are unsuccessful, the investment in such project may not be fully recoverable from future operations or sale. In connection with the spin-off we entered into several agreements with GGP with respect to certain of our assets and we may have conflicts with GGP which could adversely affect our business. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into several agreements with GGP that govern our respective rights and obligations with respect to several of our assets. We may have economic or business interests that are divergent from GGPs in relation to a particular asset, and we may have disagreements with GGP with respect to how these assets are managed and developed in the future. A prolonged recession in the national economy, or a further downturn in national or regional economic conditions, could adversely impact our business. The collapse of the housing market, together with the recent crisis in the credit markets, have resulted in a recession in the national economy with high unemployment, a lower gross domestic product and reduced consumer spending. During such times, potential customers often defer or avoid real estate purchases due to the substantial costs involved, causing land and other real estate prices to significantly decline. Significantly tighter lending standards for borrowers are also having a significant negative effect on demand. A record number of homes in foreclosure and forced sales by homeowners under distressed economic conditions are significantly contributing to the high levels of inventories of lots available for sale in some of our master planned communities. The housing market and the demand from builders for lots is local and can be very volatile, and projected lot sales used in our feasibility analysis may not be met. In addition, the success of our master planned communities business is heavily dependent on local housing markets in Las Vegas, Nevada, Houston, Texas and Baltimore, Maryland/Washington, D.C., which in turn are dependent on the health and growth of the economies and availability of credit in these regions. We do not know how long the downturn in the residential and commercial real estate markets will last or when real estate markets will return to more normal conditions. High unemployment, lack of consumer confidence and other adverse conditions in the current economic recession could significantly delay a recovery in real estate markets. Our business will suffer until market conditions improve. If market conditions were to worsen, the demand for our real estate products could further decline, negatively impacting our earnings, cash flow and liquidity. A prolonged recession could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 16 Table of Contents Some of our directors are involved in other businesses including real estate activities and public and/or private investments and, therefore, may have competing or conflicting interests with us. Certain of our directors have and may in the future have interests in other real estate business activities, including in GGP, and may have control or influence over these activities or may serve as investment advisors, directors or officers. These interests and activities, and any duties to third parties arising from such interests and activities, could divert the attention of such directors from our operations. Additionally, certain of our directors are engaged in investment and other activities in which they may learn of real estate and other related opportunities in their non-director capacities. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to our directors expressly provides, as permitted by Section 122(17) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL), that our non-employee directors are not obligated to limit their interests or activities in their non-director capacities or to notify us of any opportunities that may arise in connection therewith, even if the opportunities are complementary to or in competition with our businesses. Accordingly, we have, and investors in our common stock should have, no expectation that we will be able to learn of or participate in such opportunities. If any potential business opportunity is expressly presented to a director exclusively in his or her director capacity, the director will not be permitted to pursue the opportunity, directly or indirectly through a controlled affiliate in which the director has an ownership interest, without the approval of the independent members of our board of directors. We may face potential successor liability. We may be subject to successor liability based on previous actions of our predecessors. Such liability may arise in a number of circumstances, such as: (1) if a creditor of our predecessors did not receive proper notice of the pendency of the GGP bankruptcy proceedings or the deadline for filing claims; (2) the injury giving rise to, or source of, a creditors claim did not manifest itself in time for the creditor to file the creditors claim; (3) a creditor did not timely file the creditors claim in such bankruptcy case due to excusable neglect; (4) we are found liable for our predecessors tax liabilities under a federal and/or state theory of successor liability; or (5) the order of confirmation for the GGP bankruptcy plan is found to be procured by fraud. If we should become subject to such successor liability, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant competition could have an adverse effect on our business. The nature and extent of the competition we face depends on the type of property involved. With respect to our master planned communities, we compete with other landholders and residential and commercial property developers in the development of properties within the Las Vegas, Nevada, Houston, Texas and Baltimore/Washington, D.C. markets. A number of residential and commercial developers, some with greater financial and other resources, compete with us in seeking resources for development and prospective purchasers and tenants. Competition from other real estate developers may adversely affect our ability to attract purchasers and sell residential and commercial real estate; sell undeveloped rural land, attract and retain experienced real estate development personnel or obtain construction materials and labor. These competitive conditions can make it difficult to sell land at desirable prices and can adversely affect operations, financial condition or results of operations. There are numerous shopping facilities that compete with our operating retail properties in attracting retailers to lease space. In addition, retailers at these properties face continued competition from other retailers, including retailers at other regional shopping centers, whether owned by GGP or otherwise, outlet malls and other discount shopping centers, discount shopping clubs, catalog companies, internet sales and telemarketing. Competition of this type could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 17 Table of Contents In addition, we will compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment and development opportunities. These competitors include REITs, such as GGP, investment banking firms and private institutional investors. Our results of operations in our Operating Assets and Strategic Developments segments are subject to significant fluctuation by various factors that are beyond our control. Our results of operations in our Operating Assets and Strategic Developments segments are subject to significant fluctuations by various factors that are beyond our control. Fluctuations in these factors may decrease or eliminate the income generated by a property, and include: · the regional and local economy, which may be negatively impacted by plant closings, industry slowdowns, increased unemployment, lack of availability of consumer credit, levels of consumer debt, housing market conditions, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors; · local real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants; · perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the retail property; · the convenience and quality of competing retail properties and other retailing options such as the internet; · our ability to lease space, collect rent and attract new tenants; and · tenant rent prices, which may decline for a variety of reasons, including the impact of co-tenancy provisions in lease agreements with certain tenants. A decline in our results of operations in our Operating Assets and Strategic Developments segments could have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. If the recoverable values of our remaining inventory of real estate assets were to drop below the book value of those properties, we would be required to write-down the book value of those properties, which would have an adverse affect on our balance sheet and our earnings. Some of our projects have expensive amenities, such as pools, golf courses and clubs, or feature elaborate commercial areas requiring significant capital expenditures. Many of these costs are capitalized as part of the book value of the project. Adverse market conditions, in certain circumstances, may require the book value of real estate assets to be decreased, often referred to as a write-down or impairment. A write-down of an asset would decrease the value of the asset on our balance sheet and would reduce our earnings for the period in which the write-down is recorded. We recorded impairment charges of $503.4 million, $680.3 million and $52.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. If market conditions were to continue to deteriorate, and the recoverable values for our real estate inventory and other project land were to fall below the book value of these assets, we could be required to take additional write-downs of the book value of those assets and such write-downs could be material. We are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for cash. We are a holding company, with no operations of our own. In general, we depend on our subsidiaries for cash and our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. Our ability to generate cash to pay our 18 Table of Contents operating expenses is dependent on the earnings of and the receipt of funds from subsidiaries through dividends, distributions or intercompany loans. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay any dividends or distributions is limited by their responsibilities to satisfy their own obligations, if any, to their creditors and preferred stockholders before making any dividends or distributions to their parent holding companies. In addition, Delaware law imposes requirements that may restrict the ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. Our business model includes entering into joint venture arrangements with strategic partners. This model may not be successful and our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to successfully attract desirable strategic partners or complete agreements with strategic partners. We currently have and intend to enter into further joint venture partnerships. These joint venture partners may bring development experience, industry expertise, financial resources, financing capabilities, brand recognition and credibility or other competitive assets. We cannot assure you, however, that we will have sufficient resources, experience and/or skills to locate desirable partners. We also may not be able to attract partners who want to conduct business in the locations where our properties are, and who have the assets, reputation or other characteristics that would optimize our development opportunities. While we generally participate in making decisions for our jointly owned properties and assets, we might not always have the same objectives as the partner in relation to a particular asset, and we might not be able to formally resolve any issues that arise. For example, the Woodlands master planned community is jointly owned and we make decisions with our joint venture partner. We cannot control the ultimate outcome of any decision made, which may be to the detriment to holders of our common stock. Some of our interests, such as the Summerlin Medical Hospital Center, are controlled entirely by our partners. The bankruptcy of one of the other investors in any of our properties could materially and adversely affect the relevant property or properties. If this occurred, we would be precluded from taking some actions affecting the estate of the other investor without prior court approval which would, in most cases, entail prior notice to other parties and a hearing. At a minimum, the requirement to obtain court approval may delay the actions we would or might want to take. If the relevant joint venture through which we have invested in a property has incurred recourse obligations, the discharge in bankruptcy of one of the other investors might result in our ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations than would otherwise be required. Possible terrorist activity or other acts of violence could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future terrorist attacks in the United States or other acts of violence may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. Such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult to renew or re-lease properties at lease rates equal to or above historical rates. Terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss, and the availability of insurance for such acts, or of insurance generally, might be lower or cost more, which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that tenants are affected by future attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases. These acts might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies. Any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of new or redeveloped properties, and limit access to capital or increase the cost of capital. 19 Table of Contents Some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. A number of our properties are located in areas which are subject to natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes and oil spills. Some of our properties are located in coastal regions, and would therefore be affected by increases in sea levels, the frequency or severity of hurricanes and tropical storms, or environmental disasters such as the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, whether such events are caused by global climate changes or other factors. Some potential losses are not insured. We carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, terrorism, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. There are some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims, which generally are not insured. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. If this happens, we might remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We may be subject to potential costs to comply with environmental laws. Under various federal, state or local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of demolition or certain renovations or remodeling, the cost of which may be substantial for certain redevelopments, and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Federal and state laws also regulate the operation and removal of underground storage tanks. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of certain properties, we could be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to these regulated substances or tanks or related claims. Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Should inflation increase in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: · tenant sales may be impacted; · difficulty replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher base and/or overage rent; · an inability to receive reimbursement from tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance; and · difficulty marketing and selling land for development of residential real estate properties. Inflation also poses a potential risk due to the probability of future increases in interest rates. Such increases would adversely impact outstanding variable-rate debt as well as result in higher interest rates on new debt. Indebtedness could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2010, our consolidated debt was approximately $318.7 million of which approximately $7.0 million is recourse. Approximately $7.0 million of our consolidated debt is expected to require repayment in 2011. 20 Table of Contents In addition, as of December 31, 2010, our share of the debt of our Real Estate Affiliates was approximately $158.2 million and such debt was scheduled to mature in 2011. In March 2011, the Woodlands Partnerships refinanced their debt by entering into a $270 million facility which expires in 2014 and a $36.1 million facility which expires in 2012. After the refinancings, our share of the debt of our Real Estate Affiliates is approximately $141.0 million. Our indebtedness, particularly if increased over time, could have important consequences on the value of our common stock including: · limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of business strategy or other purposes; · limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of the business or to pay dividends; · increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given that certain indebtedness bears interest at variable rates; · limiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities, reinvest in and develop their properties, and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation; · limiting our ability, or increasing the costs, to refinance indebtedness; and · giving secured lenders the ability to foreclose on assets. Risks Related to Spin-off. We may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes related to certain prior sales of assets in our Master Planned Communities segment. In connection with the spin-off, GGP has agreed to indemnify us from and against 93.75% of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and reasonable expenses to which we become subject, in each case solely to the extent attributable to certain taxes related to sales of certain assets in our Master Planned Communities segment prior to March 31, 2010, in an amount equal to a maximum of $303.8 million, plus applicable interest. We will be responsible for the remainder of any such taxes. GGP may not have sufficient cash to reimburse us for its share of these taxes described above. We have ongoing IRS audits related to the foregoing taxes that, whether resolved by litigation or otherwise, could impact the timing of the items subject to indemnification by GGP. In addition, if the IRS were successful in litigation with respect to such audits, we may be required to change our method of tax accounting for certain transactions, which could affect the timing of our future tax payments, increasing our tax payments in the short term relative to our current tax cost projections. If the spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, then GGP and its subsidiaries may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes, and we may be obligated to indemnify GGP and its subsidiaries for such taxes. In connection with our spin-off, GGP received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that the spin-off transactions qualified as tax-free to GGP and its subsidiaries for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS. Such IRS ruling does not establish that the spin-off satisfied every requirement for a tax-free spinoff, and the parties have relied solely on the advice of counsel for comfort that such additional requirements are satisfied. 21 Table of Contents The IRS ruling is based on, among other things, certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by GGP. The failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the IRS ruling at the time of and subsequent to the spin-off. In addition, the IRS ruling is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect. If the spin-off were to be treated as taxable, GGP and holders of GGP common stock may be faced with significant tax liability with respect to the spin-off. We entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with GGP, pursuant to which GGP may be held liable for the cost of the failure of the spin-off to qualify as a tax-free distribution if GGP caused such failure, whether by an action taken before or after the spin-off. If we caused such failure, whether by an action taken before or after the spin-off, we could be liable for such costs. If the cause for the failure cannot be determined or was not caused by a single party, then we and GGP will share such liability based on relative market capitalization. Moreover, although we have agreed to share certain tax liabilities with GGP, we may be liable at law to a taxing authority for some of these tax liabilities and, if GGP were to default on their obligations to us, we would be responsible for the entire amount of these liabilities. There is a risk of investor influence over our company that may be adverse to our best interests and those of our other stockholders. M.B. Capital Partners and certain of its affiliates (collectively, M.B. Capital), Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. (Pershing Square) and Brookfield Retail Holdings LLC (Brookfield) beneficially own 17.4%, 9.5% and 6.4%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock (excluding shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants). Under the terms of our stockholder agreements, Pershing Square currently has the ability to designate three members of our board of directors, and Brookfield currently has the ability to designate one member. Although Pershing Square has entered into a standstill agreement to limit its influence over us, the concentration of ownership of our outstanding common stock held by M.B. Capital, Pershing Square, Brookfield and other substantial stockholders may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders, or more likely with the support of these stockholders. The interests of our substantial stockholders could conflict with or differ from the interests of our other stockholders. For example, the concentration of ownership held by M.B. Capital, Pershing Square and Brookfield, even if these stockholders are not acting in a coordinated manner, could allow M.B. Capital, Pershing Square and Brookfield to influence our policies and strategy and could delay, defer or prevent a change of control or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination that may otherwise be favorable to us and our other stockholders. Certain of our directors have interests in GGP that may be adverse to our interests, limiting how we conduct business with GGP. Brookfield and Pershing Square, both of whom have representatives on our board, hold material economic interests in GGP. Accordingly, we expect that a number of our directors may have, or appear to have, conflicting interests relating to us and GGP. It may be important for us to do business with GGP in the future or to supplement or amend the initial agreements between us and reorganized GGP as circumstances change. Actual or perceived conflicts of interest may decrease the effectiveness of our board of directors in dealing with GGP. For example, directors with helpful expertise may be required or decide to recuse themselves from deliberation or voting on matters involving GGP, and certain transactions in our best interests may not be pursued at all because of the risk of an appearance of a conflict or other considerations. 22 Table of Contents We will be exposed to risks relating to evaluations of our internal control over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We are in the process of evaluating our internal control systems to allow management to report on, and our independent auditors to assess, our internal control over financial reporting. We will be performing the system and process evaluation and testing (and any necessary remediation) required to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are required to comply with Section 404 by no later than December 31, 2011. We cannot be certain as to the timing of the completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. Furthermore, upon completion of this process, we may identify control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity under applicable SEC and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board rules and regulations that remain unremediated. As a public company, we are required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness or changes in internal control that materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. If we fail to implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory agencies such as the SEC. In addition, failure to comply with Section 404 or the report by us of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the trading price of our common stock may decline. If we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, our access to the capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including: · our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other comparable companies; · actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and other factors related to our business; · announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; · the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock; · changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates; · the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; · our ability to implement our business strategy; · our tax payments; · our ability to raise capital; · overall market fluctuations; and · general economic conditions. 23 Table of Contents Further, M.B. Capital, Pershing Square and Brookfield currently beneficially own 17.4%, 9.5%, and 6.4%, respectively, of our common stock (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants). The principal holders of our common stock may hold their investments for an extended period of time, thereby decreasing the number of shares available in the market and creating artificially low supply for, and trading prices of our common stock. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, Delaware law and certain of the agreements we entered into as part of our spin-off may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain the following limitations: · the inability of our stockholders to act by written consent; · restrictions on the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting without 15% of more of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of our directors; · rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; and · the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. Additionally, our certificate of incorporation imposes certain restrictions on the direct or indirect transferability of our securities to assist in the preservation of our valuable tax attributes (generally consisting of (1) approximately $400 million of suspended federal income tax deductions and (2) a relatively high federal income tax basis in our assets), including, subject to certain exceptions, that until such time as our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to impose such restrictions (i) no person or entity may acquire or accumulate the Threshold Percentage (as defined below) or more (as determined under tax law principles governing the application of section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code) of our securities, and (ii) no person owning directly or indirectly (as determined under such tax law principles) on the date of our spin-off, after giving effect to the spin-off plan, the Threshold Percentage or more of our securities may acquire additional securities of ours. Notwithstanding the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation, no assurance can be given regarding our ability to preserve our tax attributes. Threshold Percentage means, in the case of (i) our common stock, 4.99% of the number of outstanding shares of our common stock and (ii) any other class of our equity, 4.99% of each such class. There may be dilution of our common stock from the exercise of outstanding warrants, which may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and negatively impact a holders investments. The exercise of some or all of the outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our common stock would materially dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. Likewise, any additional issuances of common stock, through The Howard Hughes Corporation 2010 Equity Incentive Plan or otherwise, will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of such additional common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, the existence of our outstanding warrants may encourage short selling or arbitrage trading activity by market participants because the exercise of our warrants could depress the price of our common stock. 24 Table of Contents Additional issuances and sales of our capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, may cause prevailing market prices for our common stock to decline and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at a favorable time and price. Brookfield is subject to restrictions on its ability to sell our common stock and its warrants to acquire our common stock. After these restrictions expire, shares held by Brookfield may be sold in the public markets. The price of our common stock may drop significantly when such restrictions expire.
