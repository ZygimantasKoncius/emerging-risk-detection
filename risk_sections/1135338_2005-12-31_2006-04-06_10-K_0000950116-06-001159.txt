ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS This report contains certain forward looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) and information relating to Pegasus Communications Corporation that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to our management. These statements may differ materially from actual future events or results. When used in this report, the words “estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “hope,” “intend,” “expect,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements, although not all forward looking statements contain these identifying words. Any statement that is not a historical fact, including estimates, projections, future trends and the outcome of events that have not yet occurred, are forward looking statements. Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward looking statements. Such factors include the risks described in this section below and elsewhere in this report and, although it is not possible to create a comprehensive list of all factors that may cause actual results to differ from our forward looking statements, such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions, including nationally, internationally, and in the regions in which we operate; catastrophic events, including acts of terrorism; relationships with and events affecting third parties; patent infringement litigation related to our license with Personalized Media; demographic changes; existing government regulations, and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; competition, including the loss of any significant numbers of subscribers; changes in business strategy or development plans; the cost of pursuing new business initiatives; an expansion of land based communications systems; technological developments and difficulties; an inability to obtain intellectual property licenses and to avoid committing intellectual property infringement; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the availability and terms of capital to fund the expansion of our businesses; litigation and governmental proceedings; and other factors mentioned in this report. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 14 Back to Contents General: We currently generate limited revenues and we expect to incur losses as we develop our wireless high speed Internet business. Our operations currently generate limited revenues and we expect to incur operating losses as we continue to develop our wireless high-speed Internet business. We are unable to predict whether or when we may achieve profitability. Revenues and profits, if any, will depend upon many factors, including our ability to execute on our business strategy, market acceptance of our wireless high-speed Internet services, Federal and state regulations, and general economic conditions. We may not be able to secure additional financing to fund our wireless high-speed Internet business, or may only be able to obtain funding upon terms considered unattractive. Our current resources are unlikely to be sufficient to fund the continued development of our wireless high-speed Internet business to profitability. We intend to seek additional debt and equity financing to fund its operations within the next twelve months. There is no assurance that we will be successful in securing such additional financing or, if funding is obtained, that such funding will be sufficient to maintain those operations. Furthermore, such financing may be at Pegasus Communications or at a subsidiary level, may contain terms considered unattractive (such as, but not limited to, interest rates, restrictive covenants including on uses of cash, and price at which equity is sold), and if in the form of equity, there is no assurance that such funding will be available on terms that are not significantly dilutive to the ownership of existing shareholders. We are not currently eligible to register our securities on a short form registration statement on Form S-3. We will not be eligible to use Form S-3 until we have made timely filings of periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for at least twelve calendar months and have paid all dividends in arrears on our Series C convertible preferred stock. We may not realize value from our intangible assets. If we must reassess the fair value of our intangible assets, we may be required to record impairment charges to earnings. We are required, under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, to review a long-lived asset for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. At December 31, 2005, we had intangible assets with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $130 million, primarily consisting of our 700 MHz Licenses (carrying value of $60.9 million) and our license of the Personalized Media intellectual property rights (carrying value of $67.4 million). See discussions related to these intangible assets in Item 1 700 MHz Licenses and Intellectual Property Rights Licensed. The values of the 700 MHz Licenses could be affected by a number of factors which are further discussed below under Risk Factors  700 MHz Licenses. The value of our license with Personalized Media could be adversely affected in the future by significant ongoing patent infringement litigation as well as a reexamination of the underlying patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (see Item 3  Patent Infringement Litigation). There can be no assurance that we will not experience impairment losses in the future. Any such impairment loss could result in a substantial charge to our earnings. 15 Back to Contents If we are unable to retain and attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to operate successfully. Our future success will depend on our ability to retain current key personnel, and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel. The loss of key personnel or our inability to hire or retain qualified personnel, or our failure to assimilate effectively such personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Compliance with public company reporting requirements is costly, and such costs are material to our results of operations. Our Class A common stock is currently registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”), which requires that we comply with public reporting and proxy statement requirements established by the SEC. Compliance with these requirements is costly and time-consuming, and these costs are material to our results of operations. Voting control of our stock is held by one person. We have three classes of common stock that differ only in voting rights. The Class A common stock has one vote per share, the Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and the Non-Voting common stock has no voting rights. The Class B common stock is convertible into Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis. All of the Class B common stock is controlled by Marshall W. Pagon, our Chief Executive Officer, and our certificate of incorporation limits transfers of Class B common stock to Mr. Pagon and his family members and controlled entities. The Class A and Class B classes vote together as if they were a single class on nearly all matters, including the election of directors and fundamental events that require stockholder approval. See the next risk factor for some of the limited exceptions to this rule. Because of this voting difference, Mr. Pagon controls the outcome of nearly all matters on which the stockholders vote. Mr. Pagon currently has approximately 63.0% of the votes. One consequence of Mr. Pagon’s voting control is that no one can acquire us or gain control of us without his approval. A single shareholder other than Mr. Pagon has accumulated a significant amount of our Class A common stock and may therefore be able to determine the vote on any matter that requires approval of the holders of Class A common stock voting as a separate class. In statements filed with the SEC, Peninsula Capital Advisors, LLC and Peninsula Investment Partners, L.P. (together, “Peninsula”) reported that they had acquired beneficial ownership of 6,880,500 shares of our Class A common stock. They may therefore be in a position to determine the outcome of any vote requiring the approval of the Class A common stockholders regardless of the wishes of other Class A common stockholders. Under our certificate of incorporation, some but not all matters that require stockholder approval require the approval of the holders of Class A common stock voting as a separate class. Although a class vote is not required for a merger, consolidation, sale of assets, or tender offer, there are a number of matters affecting our common stock that do require a class vote. They include (i) the issuance of additional shares of Class B common stock (except in instances in which parallel action is being taken on the Class A common stock such as with stock dividends, stock splits, etc.), (ii) any decrease in the voting rights per share of the Class A common stock or any increase in the voting rights of the Class B common stock, (iii) any increase in the number of shares of Class A common stock into which shares of Class B common stock are convertible, (iv) any relaxation on the restrictions on transfer of the Class B common stock, and (v) any changes in the powers, preferences, or special rights of the Class A common stock or the Class B common stock which may adversely affect holders of the Class A common stock. 16 Back to Contents We have significant accumulated dividends on our Series C convertible preferred stock that are in arrears. This limits our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. As permitted by the certificate of designation for our Series C convertible preferred stock, our board of directors has the discretion to declare or not to declare any scheduled quarterly dividends for Series C convertible preferred stock. Since January 31, 2002, our board of directors has only declared a dividend of $100 thousand on the series, which was paid with shares of our Class A common stock. The total amount of dividends in arrears on Series C convertible preferred stock at December 31, 2005 was $48.4 million. In addition, the dividend of $3.2 million subject to declaration on January 31, 2006 was not declared. Dividends not declared accumulate in arrears until paid. Payments of cash dividends on our common stock cannot be made until all accumulated dividends on the Series C convertible preferred stock have been paid. To the extent that dividends continue to accumulate in arrears, the book value of common stockholders’ equity will continue to erode. Governmental investigations may adversely affect us. On August 11, 2004, Pegasus Communications received an investigative subpoena from the SEC to produce documents related to it and its subsidiaries’ practices in reporting the number of subscribers of its direct broadcast satellite business. While we are cooperating fully with the SEC in its investigation, we cannot predict the outcome of the SEC's investigation or when the investigation will be resolved. An adverse outcome of this investigation could have a material adverse effect on us and could result in the institution of administrative or civil proceedings, sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties, stockholder lawsuits and increased review and scrutiny of our business by our customers, regulatory authorities, the media and others. We may be subject to claims in connection with or following the bankruptcy proceedings involving our subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the liquidating trustee appointed under the Plan of Reorganization (the “Liquidating Trustee”) is responsible for investigating and prosecuting or settling any claims or causes of action of the Debtors existing on the date the Plan of Reorganization became effective (the “Liquidating Trust Claims”). Liquidating Trust Claims include any claims of the Debtors against Pegasus Communications Corporation and its non-Debtor subsidiaries, as well as any claims against the officers and directors of the non-Debtors and the Debtors, that may have arisen during the bankruptcy proceedings and were not released by the Global Settlement Agreement (the “Global Settlement Agreement”) entered into on July 30, 2004 by Pegasus Satellite Communications, Pegasus Communications, DIRECTV Inc., the National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative, and the creditors committee representing the unsecured creditors of the Debtors. Under the Global Settlement Agreement, the Debtors released any and all claims against the non-Debtors and the officers and directors of the Debtors and the non-Debtors arising on or prior to August 27, 2004, excluding claims, if any, arising under the Support Services Agreement. Although we do not believe that any Liquidating Trust Claims have arisen that are likely to result in any material liability to us, we may be required to incur costs in connection with the Liquidating Trustee’s investigation or assertion of any such claims and, if the Liquidating Trustee were to successfully assert any such claims, we could be subject to payment of damages in connection therewith. Further, to the extent any such claims are asserted against our officers and directors, we may incur indemnification obligations in connection therewith. Neither the Global Settlement Agreement nor the Plan of Reorganization released any claims against Pegasus Communications and its non-Debtor subsidiaries that may be held by third parties in their individual capacity and not derivatively. Although we are not aware of any such claims that are likely to result in any material liability to us, if any such claims were to be asserted against us or our officers and directors, we may be required to incur costs in connection therewith, including pursuant to indemnification obligations to our officers and directors. 17 Back to Contents Wireless High Speed Internet Services: There may be limited demand for the wireless high-speed internet services we plan to offer. The market for wireless high speed Internet services is in the early stages of development. Critical issues concerning wireless communications and data access, including security, reliability, cost, regulatory issues, ease of use and quality of service, have not yet been fully determined and their further evolution is likely to affect the market for our high-speed wireless Internet services. We cannot reliably project potential demand for our wireless high-speed Internet service, particularly whether there will be sufficient demand at the volume and prices we need to be profitable. Moreover, if the customer base for our high-speed service does not expand at the rate required to support the planned deployment of our network, our business may suffer, and we may be unable to complete our planned deployment. In addition, competition to provide wireless high speed Internet services of the type we offer could result in a high turnover rate among our users, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We may not be able to effectively compete in providing wireless high-speed Internet services. In providing wireless high-speed Internet services, we will be competing with many well-established and well-financed competitors including cable operators, local exchange carriers, cellular/PCS operators and other wireless broadband operators. Many of these competitors have substantially greater access to capital than our company, substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources than we have and significantly more experience in providing the types of services that we offer. Many of these competitors are national or regional in nature and therefore enjoy operational scale economies that are not currently available to us. Other competitors could also emerge that could support a network similar in performance to ours, or as a result of the FCC auctions of additional spectrum in the future. In addition, although we are currently evaluating our ability to offer commercial grade digital telephone services using VoIP technology, IP-video based services and other emerging IP-based technologies, we are currently only able to offer our customers wireless high-speed Internet access. Many of our competitors are currently able to offer customers such voice, video and other applications in addition to high-speed Internet access, which may make the services offered by our competitors more attractive to potential customers. If we are unable to effectively compete in providing high-speed wireless services, it will adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our success will depend on our ability to develop new products and services that keep pace with technological advances. The market for data access and communications services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards in both the wireless and wire line industries. Our success will depend to a substantial degree on our ability to develop and introduce, in a timely and cost-effective manner, enhancements to our wireless high-speed Internet service and new products and services that meet changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards. For example, increased data rates provided by wired data access technologies, such as digital subscriber lines, may affect customer perceptions as to the adequacy of our service and may also result in the widespread development and acceptance of applications that require a higher data transfer rate than our high-speed service provides. Our technology or systems may become obsolete upon the introduction of alternative technologies. If we do not develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner, we may lose users to competing service providers, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. 18 Back to Contents Our Xanadoo(SM)wireless high-speed network utilizes leased frequency bands for which renewals of our existing leases are not guaranteed and for which the costs of acquiring leases in the future may increase. Although our existing 2.5 GHz leases are diversified among numerous markets and license holders, we are nonetheless buying leaseholds to licensed assets that we do not own. No assurance can be given that we will be able to renew our existing leases in perpetuity or upon favorable renewal terms. Furthermore, as noted above in Legislation and Regulation, the FCC is examining whether to establish a maximum term for EBS leases. The FCC’s resolution of that issue will affect our ability to renew our existing EBS leases and to lease additional EBS spectrum, as well as affect our ability to recover our investment in our wireless high-speed network. Certain of our 2.5 GHz rights are subject to conditions that may not occur. As previously noted, our 2.5 GHz rights include rights as March 1, 2006 to EBS and BRS channels covering 3.9 million people and 189.6 million MHz Pop under asset purchase agreements or letters of intent which are subject to conditions precedent that had not yet been satisfied. There can be no assurance as to the extent that these conditions will be met. We depend on a physical infrastructure maintained by third parties and subject to disruption by events outside our control. The success of our wireless high speed Internet service offerings will depend upon the capacity, reliability and security of the infrastructure used to carry data between our users and the Internet. There are certain portions of our network that rely on segments owned, operated and maintained by third parties. A bandwidth carrier that provides poor service and has frequent network outages could greatly limit our ability to provide quality service to our customers. Our financial and business results may be negatively affected by leasing poorly maintained infrastructure from various third parties. Our Xanadoo(SM) business utilizes a proprietary technology purchased from a third party, and could be subject to increased costs or disruptions if we need to implement alternative technologies. Our Xanadoo(SM) service currently uses technology proprietary to a single vendor. This vendor is a small company with venture capital backing. Our ability to successfully deliver our Xanadoo service will in part be affected by the vendor’s ability to keep pace with technological advances, execute upon its operating plan, and maintain adequate access to capital. While this company has committed itself to making its technology compatible with the WiMAX global standard as soon as WiMAX certification is commercially available, there can be no assurance that this company can achieve WiMAX certification for its technology. In the event that this company does not achieve WiMAX certification and its technology remains proprietary, there is a risk that this proprietary technology may become obsolete or unavailable. In such event, our Xanadoo(SM) service could be subject to disruption and/or increased costs as we implement replacement technologies. 19 Back to Contents If we are unable to negotiate leases for the installation of our equipment, the deployment of our network will be impaired. The majority of our current and planned tower sites are leased from professional tower management companies, cellular carriers or owners of existing structures such as municipal water towers and radio towers. We expect that this will continue to be the case as we build out our wireless high-speed network. There is competition for tower sites, and many of the best tower sites are already leased to other wireless communications companies. If we are not able to negotiate leases, or we are not able to negotiate leases on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us, the deployment of our network may be delayed, and our market coverage may be negatively affected. 700 MHz Licenses: If we are unable to provide substantial service to an area covered by a 700 MHz License by January 1, 2015, we could lose the license. The terms of our 700 MHz Licenses require that we must provide substantial service to the service areas covered by the 700 MHz Licenses by January 1, 2015. If such service is not provided by the deadline, the FCC could revoke the license for a particular service area, or take other adverse regulatory action. The FCC’s rules provide for a presumption of substantial service if the licensee either leases a predominant amount of the licensed spectrum in at least 50.1% of the geographic area covered by the license or provides coverage to at least 50.1% of the service area’s population. We cannot assure that we will be able to provide substantial service according to the FCC’s requirements. Pending and future FCC rule-makings may directly or indirectly affect the commercial development of the 700 MHz frequency band. The 700 MHz frequency band is regulated by the FCC, and the regulations governing this band are subject to change. The FCC has recently issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) that seeks comment on proposals to facilitate the provision of broadband communications within the 700 MHz frequency band allocated to public safety that is adjacent to our 700 MHz Licenses. Changes in the regulations governing the 700 MHz public safety spectrum that may result from this NPRM may affect the use of our 700 MHz Licenses. In addition, the FCC has indicated that it is likely to issue one or more additional NPRM’s seeking comment on other aspects of the 700 MHz frequency band in 2006 or 2007. Such NPRM’s, if issued, may affect both the regulations governing and the commercial development of the 700 MHz frequency band, including our 700 MHz Licenses. We can provide no assurance that current and future NPRM’s will not adversely affect the commercial development of our 700 MHz Licenses. ITEM 1B.
