D. Risk factors  We are a holding company and depend on payments from our subsidiaries and affiliates to meet our payment obligations in this annual report. In addition to available cash and the undrawn amount of revolving credit facilities mentioned above, as of this report, currently we can draw up to $270 million from unused lines of credit granted by Chilean banks, and Endesa Chile can draw up to another $255 million from similar sources. Our level of consolidated indebtedness increased by 20%, from $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2006, to $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2007. This increase is primarily due to the appreciation during the year of most of the South American exchange rates against the dollar. We do not currently anticipate liquidity shortfalls affecting our ability to satisfy the obligations described in this report. We expect to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due, fund our purchase obligations outlined previously with internally generated cash, and fund capital expenditures with a mixture of internally generated cash and borrowings. Transactions that most significantly affected Enersis foreign subsidiaries liquidity in 2007 included:  Edegel: loan agreements for $50 million for the short and the long term. Edegel also made bond issuances in the Peruvian market for approximately $71 million, with maturities ranging from 4 to 15 years, which were used to refinance and prepay debt, improving contractual conditions and debt maturity.  Edelnor: local bonds for approximately $53 million equivalent in local currency with maturities between 5 years and 8 years, which were used to refinance debt. Also, Edelnor signed short-term loans for $195 million, including renovations and new debt, taking advantage of low interest rates.  Endesa Costanera: debt refinancing for $70 million with bank loans with medium-term maturity and supplier financing with maturity of 5 years.  Edesur: debt prepayment for $65 million with a local bond issuance for approximately $50 million with maturity of 5 years and a medium-term bilateral loan for $15 million. Edesur extended its debt duration and improved interest rate terms. Likewise, in November the company signed an interest rate swap for $15 million to fix the rate of the medium-term bilateral loan.  Ampla: 3-year bank loans for $135 million and debt refinancing for $40 million, extending debt maturity from 2 to 5 years and lowering interest rate by 15 basis points. In December, Ampla signed bank loans to refinance bonds due in March 2008, for $163 million with maturities of 5 and 6 years. 110 Table of Contents  Endesa Fortaleza: cross currency swap for $25 million, redenominating part of its debt from dollars to reais, reducing currency mismatch between debt and revenues generation.  Coelce: bank loans for a total of approximately $71 million and swaps to hedge the interest and exchange rate risks of these debts for approximately $60 million.  Emgesa: bank loans for $57 million with short-term maturity and debt refinancings in February 2007 with local bond issuances for $77 million with a maturity of 10 years.  Codensa: bank loans for $511 million with short-term maturity and short term debt refinancings with local bond issuances for approximately $323 million with maturities of 3 and 10 years. Transactions that most significantly affected Enersis foreign subsidiaries liquidity during 2006 included:  Edegel: loan agreement for $20 million for a 3-year term entered into in July. Two bond issuances on the Peruvian market in October 2006 for $25 million soles each ($16 million) for 7 years. Bank note refinancing for $50 million soles for a 2-year term. Finally, new loan with a foreign bank for $24 million for 3 years to refinance short-term loans.  Edelnor: local bonds for approximately $53 million equivalent in local currency with maturities between 3 years and 10 years.  Edesur: bank loan refinancings for Ar$150 million with a 3-year syndicated loan.  CIEN: $280 million debt refinancing with a syndicated loan of R$600 million on a 6-year term (with a grace period of three years).  Ampla: local debentures in Brazil for R$370 million (approximately $173 million) on a 6-year term loan to prepay bank loans. Also, a 5-year loan with BNDES for R$300 million ($140 million) to finance Amplas investment plan.  Endesa Fortaleza: syndicated loan led by IFC for $130 million with an average maturity of approximately 7 years to refinance short-term debt.  Coelce: two loans for a total of approximately $90 million equivalent in local currency to finance investments.  El Chocón: bank loan for $100 million for a 5-year term and its proceeds were used to prepay commercial papers maturing in 2007.  Betania: bond in the Colombian market for $100 billion CPs ($44 million), 7-year maturity.

There is a tendency toward greater competition in some countries in the Region where we operate, combined with a liberalization of regulated markets, and the introduction of trading companies that will market energy to final clients. This would give us access to a broader customer base, allowing us to compete for higher margin clients. The tendency toward the interconnection of electricity systems, including cross-border systems, is changing due to difficulties in the electricity supply from Argentina to Brazil, and the gas supply from Argentina to Chile, for instance. This has led to the use of local sources of energy, or internationally traded fuels that eliminate the dependency on a single supplier. There is a sustained growth in demand, combined with delays in the start-up of new capacity, to which is added the important increase in the cost of fossil fuels. This results in a generalized increase in production costs and marginal costs in almost all the countries. This situation is most serious in Chile, Argentina and Brazil, but attenuated in Peru and Colombia. This sustained increase in the value of electricity generation represents an opportunity for predominantly hydroelectric generators due to the revaluation of this type of energy. This trend also offers important opportunities for growth and expansion in generating capacity. Regarding supplies of energy to the term market, an upward trend is also noted in prices, as well as the need to design contractual tariffs and schemes with customers having the necessary flexibility for handling price volatility. The gap between supply and demand for gas is widening due to the stagnation in gas production in Argentina and the lack of gas extraction infrastructure in Bolivia, for export to Brazil and Argentina, which has led Chile, Argentina and Brazil to look at the possibility of LNG projects for meeting their needs. Chile and Brazil have ongoing LNG projects. Altogether, the situation offers important opportunities for improving generating margins and the challenge of relationships with customers subject to higher prices and regulators whose essential concern is the safety and adequacy of supplies.

The current Board of Directors was elected at the Ordinary Shareholders meeting dated April 1, 2008, for a period of three years. For the period during which each director has served, please see   A. Directors and Senior Management above. Corporate Governance Enersis is managed by its Executive Officers under the direction of its Board of Directors which, in accordance with the estatutos, or articles of incorporation, or bylaws, consists of seven directors who are elected at an annual regular shareholders meeting. Each director serves for a three-year term and the term of each of the seven directors expires on the same day. Staggered terms are not permitted under Chilean law. If a vacancy occurs on the board during the three-year term, the Board of Directors may appoint a temporary director to fill the vacancy. In addition, the vacancy will trigger an election for every seat on the Board of Directors at the next Ordinary Shareholders Meeting. The current Board of Directors was elected in April 2008 and their terms expire in April 2011. Chilean corporate law provides that a companys Board of Directors is responsible for the management, administration and representation of a company in all matters concerning its corporate purpose, subject to the provisions of the companys estatutos and the stockholders resolutions. In addition to the estatutos, the Board of Directors of Enersis has adopted regulations and policies that guide our corporate governance principles. The most important of these regulations and policies are the following: The Internal Regulations on Conduct in Securities Markets, approved by the Board on January 31, 2002, defines the rules of conduct that must be followed by members of the Board of Directors, senior management and other executives and employees who, due to the nature of their job responsibilities, may have access to sensitive or confidential information, with a view to contributing to transparency and to the protection of investors. These regulations are based on the principles of impartiality and good faith, placing the companys interests before ones own, and care and diligence in using information when acting in the securities markets. The Charter Governing Executives (Estatuto del Directivo), approved by the Board on May 28, 2003, and the Employees Code of Conduct, provide the rules governing dealings with customers and suppliers, and establish the principles that should be followed by employees, including ethical conduct, professionalism and confidentiality. They also impose limitations on the activities that our senior executives and other employees may undertake outside the scope of their employment with us. 118 Table of Contents The regulations and rules mentioned above reflect our core principles of transparency, respect for stockholders rights, and the duty of care and loyalty of the directors imposed by Chilean law. On January 15, 2008, the SVS enacted its Norma de Carácter General N° 211, which instructed Chilean issuers to adopt internal policies and regulations related to the information they have to provide to the market and to the systems implemented in order to guarantee a timely communication of such information. To such effect, each Chilean issuer shall dispose to the market a document denominated Manual de Manejo de Información de Interés para el Mercado, which among others, must address the following issues: applicable standards to the information of transactions of the Companys securities or those of its affiliates by directors, principal executives and other related parties; existence of blackout periods for such transactions by directors, principal executives and other related parties; existence of mechanisms for the continuous revelation of information that is of interest to the market; mechanisms that provide protection for confidential information, etc. Such Manual must be enacted and informed to the market by June 1, 2008. Compliance with NYSE Listing Standards on Corporate Governance The following is a summary of the significant differences between our corporate governance practices and those applicable to domestic issuers under the corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Because we are a controlled company under NYSE rules (a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company), we would not, were we to be a U.S. company, be subject to the requirement that we have a majority of independent directors, or nomination and compensation committees. Independence and Functions of the Audit Committee Under the NYSE corporate governance rules, all members of the Audit Committee must be independent. We are subject to this requirement as of July 31, 2005. Under the NYSE corporate governance rules, the audit committee of a U.S. company must perform the functions detailed in, and otherwise comply with the requirements of NYSE Listed Company Manual Rules 303A.06 and 303A.07. Non-U.S. companies have been required to comply with Rule 303A.06 beginning July 31, 2005, but are not required to comply with Rule 303A.07. We do not currently comply with Rule 303A.07, but as of July 31, 2005, we did comply with the independence and the functional requirements of Rule 303A.06. As required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the NYSE corporate governance rules, on June 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Enersis created an Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is currently composed of three directors meeting the applicable independence requirements of the NYSE: Messrs. Juan Eduardo Errázuriz, Patricio Claro and Hernán Somerville. As required by Chilean Law, Enersis also has a Directors Committee composed of three directors. Although Chilean Law requires that the majority of the Directors Committee (two out of three members) be composed of directors who were not nominated by the votes of the controlling shareholder or, if excluding the votes from the controlling shareholders would have been elected nevertheless (a non-control director), it permits the Directors Committee to be composed of a majority or even a unanimity of control directors, if there are not sufficient non-control directors on the Board to serve on the committee. Currently, our Directors Committee is composed of one non-control director and two directors appointed by the controlling shareholder. 119 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Guidelines The NYSEs corporate governance rules require U.S.-listed companies to adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines. Although Chilean law does not contemplate this practice (except for the Manual de Manejo de Información de Interés para el Mercado, which must be adopted by June 1, 2008), the Company has adopted the codes of conduct described above, and its Special Shareholders Meeting held on March 2006, approved the inclusion of articles in its bylaws that govern the creation, composition, attributions, functions and retribution of the Directors Committee and the Audit Committee. Committees and Other Advisory Bodies Directors Committee (Comité de Directores) The Directors Committee is composed of three members who are simultaneously directors of the Company. It performs the following functions:  examination of Annual Report, Financial Statements and the Reports of the External Auditors and Inspectors of the Accounts;  formulation of the proposal to the Board of Directors for the selection of external auditors and private rating agencies;  examination of information related to operations by the Company with related parties and/or related to operations in which the Company board members or relevant executive officers may have personal interest;  examination of the compensation framework and plans for managers and executive officers; and  any other function mandated to the committee by the estatutos, the Board of Directors or the shareholders of the Company. Pablo Yrarrázaval, Chairman of the Board, has also served as chairman of this committee since July 31, 2002. The other members are Hernán Somerville and Patricio Claro. The Audit Committee (Comité de Auditoría) The Audit Committee is composed of three independent members who also serve as directors of the Company.

Article 89 of the Chilean Companies Act requires that our transactions with our parent company, subsidiaries and/or their related parties be on equitable conditions, similar to those customarily prevailing in the market. Directors and executive officers of companies who violate Article 89 are liable for losses resulting from such violation. In addition, Article 44 of the Chilean Companies Act, as amended, provides that a corporation may only execute transactions in which one or more directors have a personal interest or an interest as a representative of another person, when such transactions are previously examined and reported to the Board of Directors by the Directors Committee and then approved by the Board of Directors prior to execution by the Company, and the terms of such transactions are adjusted to equitable conditions similar to those customarily prevailing in the market. Resolutions approving transactions under Article 44 must be reported to our stockholders in the next stockholders meeting. If the transactions involve a material amount, the Board of Directors must determine in advance if the transactions are adjusted to equitable conditions similar to those customarily prevailing in the market or not. If the board decides that it is not possible to ascertain such conditions, the Board of Directors, with the exclusion of interested directors, may approve or reject the transaction, or appoint two independent appraisers. The appraisers report will be available to the shareholders and the Board of Directors for a period of 20 business days. Once such term has expired, the Board of Directors with the abstention of interested directors may approve or reject the transaction. If shareholders representing 5% or more of the voting shares consider that the terms and conditions of the transactions are not favorable to the interests of the Company, or that the appraisers reports are substantially different, they may request that the board convene a Special Shareholders meeting to approve or reject the transaction with a majority of two-thirds of the voting shares. Violation of Article 44 may result in administrative and criminal sanctions and civil liability to us, our shareholders or interested third parties who suffer losses as a result of such violation. We, our shareholders and interested third parties, however, may ask the interested director to reimburse the Company in an amount equivalent to the benefits that the transaction in violation of Article 44 represented to the interested director, relatives and/or representatives. It is a common practice in Chile to transfer surplus funds from one company to another affiliate that has a cash deficit. These transactions are carried out through either short-term inter-company loans or through structured inter-company loans. Under Chilean law and regulation, such transactions must be carried out on an arms-length basis. It is our policy to manage all cash inflows and outflows of our wholly-owned Chilean subsidiaries, Endesa Chile and Endesa Chiles Chilean subsidiaries by way of a centralized cash management policy. Such centralized cash management is more efficient for both financial and tax reasons. All of these operations are subject to the supervision of our Directors Committee. In other countries in which we do business, these inter-company transactions are permitted but they have adverse tax consequences. Accordingly, we do not similarly manage the cash flows of our non-Chilean subsidiaries.

The largest net amount outstanding during 2007and 2006 for such loans was $27, and $89 million, respectively.

The interest rate on the intercompany loans to Enersis foreign subsidiaries ranges from Libor plus 5% to Libor plus 6%, with a nominal weighted average interest rate of Libor plus 5.9%. 123 Table of Contents Endesa Chile has also made structured loans to its subsidiaries in Chile, primarily to finance projects and refinance existing indebtedness.

Dividends As determined by Enersis Board of Directors, the dividend policy for fiscal year 2007 was to pay a provisional dividend to stockholders equivalent to 15% of net income accumulated up to September 30, 2007 before negative goodwill amortization, which would be paid on December 2007, and a definitive dividend payment equal to 70% of the annual net income of fiscal year 2007 before negative goodwill amortization. The Board generally proposes a definitive dividend payable each year, and attributable to the prior year, which cannot be less than the legal minimum of 30% of annual net income before negative goodwill amortization. At a meeting held on March 28, 2008, the Board of Directors agreed to propose at the general shareholders meeting held on April 1, 2008, the payment of a definitive dividend of Ch$3.94375 per share for fiscal year 2007, which is equal to 70% of the annual net income before negative goodwill amortization. The provisional dividend of Ch $0.53119 per share paid on December 2007 was deducted from the definitive dividend to be paid on April 30, 2008, as agreed by the general shareholders meeting. The Board of Directors also approved a dividend policy for fiscal year 2008 according to which a provisional dividend would be paid to stockholders equal to 15% of the net income accumulated up to September 30, 2008, before negative goodwill amortization, and to propose to the general shareholders meeting to be held during the first four months of 2009, a definitive dividend payment equal to 70% of the annual net income of fiscal year 2008, before negative goodwill amortization. Actual dividend payments will be subject to net profits obtained in each period, as well as to expectations of future profit levels and other conditions that may exist at the time of such dividend declaration. 124 Table of Contents Enersis, as a holding company, is primarily dependent upon cash inflows from its operating subsidiaries in the form of dividend payments, interest payments, management fees and capital reductions to service its debt obligations.
