ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The investment in our company has a high degree of risk. Before you invest you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this filing. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be harmed and the value of our stock could go down. This means you could lose all or a part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Our home sales and operating revenues could decline due to macro-economic and other factors outside of our control, such as changes in consumer confidence and declines in employment levels. Changes in national and regional economic conditions, as well as local economic conditions where the Company conducts its operations and where prospective purchasers of our homes live, may result in more caution on the part of home buyers and consequently may make fewer home purchases. These economic uncertainties involve, among other things, conditions of supply and demand in local markets and changes in consumer confidence and income, employment levels, and government regulations. These risks and uncertainties could periodically have an adverse effect on consumer demand for and the pricing of our homes, which could cause our operating revenues to decline. In addition, builders are subject to various risks, many of them outside the control of the homebuilder including competitive overbuilding, availability and cost of building lots, materials and labor, adverse weather conditions which can cause delays in construction schedules, cost overruns, changes in government regulations, and increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees. A reduction in our revenues could, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our securities. An increase in mortgage interest rates or unavailability of mortgage financing may reduce consumer demand for the Company’s homes. Virtually all purchasers of our homes finance their acquisitions through lenders providing mortgage financing. A substantial increase in mortgage interest rates or unavailability of mortgage financing would adversely affect the ability of prospective home buyers to obtain the financing they would need in order to purchase our homes, as well as adversely affect the ability of prospective move-up home buyers to sell their current homes. For example, if mortgage financing became less available, demand for our homes could decline. A reduction in demand could also have an adverse effect on the pricing of our homes because we and our competitors may reduce prices in an effort to better compete for home buyers. A reduction in pricing could result in a decline in revenues and in our margins. We could experience a reduction in home sales and revenues or reduced cash flows if we are unable to obtain reasonably priced financing to support our home building and land development activities. The real estate development industry is capital intensive, and development requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land and begin development. Accordingly, we incur substantial indebtedness to finance our home building and land development activities. Although we believe that internally generated funds and current borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our capital and other expenditures (including land acquisition, development, and construction activities), the amounts available from such sources may not be adequate to meet our needs. If such sources are not sufficient, we would seek additional capital in the form of debt or equity financing from a variety of potential sources, including bank financing and or securities offerings. The availability of borrowed funds, to be used for land acquisition, development, and construction, may be greatly reduced, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with new loans. The failure to obtain sufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to extensive government regulation which could cause the Company to incur significant liabilities or restrict its business activities. Regulatory requirements also could cause us to incur significant liabilities and operating expenses and could restrict our business activities. We are subject to statutes and rules regulating, among other things, certain developmental matters, building and site design, and matters concerning the protection of health and the environment. Our operating expenses may be increased by governmental regulations such as building permit allocation ordinances and other fees and taxes, which may be imposed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements. Any delay or refusal from government agencies to grant us necessary licenses, permits, and approvals could have an adverse effect on our operations. 18 We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including industry and market conditions, our ability to successfully implement our new branding and marketing initiative, and expansion of our production capabilities. We anticipate that we may need to raise additional funds in order to grow our business and implement our business strategy. We anticipate that any such additional funds would be raised through equity or debt financings. In addition, we may enter into a revolving credit facility or a term loan facility with one or more syndicates of lenders. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. Even if we are able to raise capital through equity or debt financings, as to which there can be no assurance, the interest of existing shareholders in our company may be diluted, and the securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock or may otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing shareholders. If we cannot obtain adequate capital, we may not be able to fully implement our business strategy, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.” In addition, we have and will continue to raise additional capital through private placements or registered offerings, in which broker-dealers will be engaged. The activities of such broker-dealers are highly regulated, and we cannot assure that the activities of such broker-dealers will not violate relevant regulations and generate liabilities despite our expectation otherwise. We depend on the availability of additional human resources for future growth. We are currently experiencing a period of significant growth in our sales volume. We believe that continued expansion is essential for us to remain competitive and to capitalize on the growth potential of our business. Such expansion may place a significant strain on our management and operations and financial resources. As our operations continue to grow, we will have to continually improve our management, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, and other resources infrastructure, and expand our workforce. There can be no assurance that our existing or future management, operating and financial systems, procedures, and controls will be adequate to support our operations, or that we will be able to recruit, retain, and motivate employees. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish, develop, or maintain the business relationships beneficial to our operations, or to do so or to implement any of the above activities in a timely manner. Failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations and financial condition. We may be adversely affected by the fluctuation in raw material prices and selling prices of our products. Our projects and the raw materials we use have experienced significant price fluctuations in the past. There is no assurance that they will not be subject to future price fluctuations or pricing control. The land and raw materials we use may experience price volatility caused by events such as market fluctuations or changes in governmental programs. The market price of land and raw materials may also experience significant upward adjustment, if, for instance, there is a material under-supply or over-demand in the market. These price changes may ultimately result in increases in the selling prices of our products, and may, in turn, adversely affect our sales volume, revenue, and operating profit. We could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural disasters. From time to time, our developed sites may experience strong winds, storms, floods, and earthquakes. Natural disasters could impede operations and or damage infrastructure necessary to our constructions and operations. The occurrence of natural disasters could adversely affect our business, the results of our operations, prospects, and financial condition, even though we currently have insurance against damages caused by natural disasters, including typhoons, accidents, or similar events. We are dependent on third-party subcontractors, manufacturers, and distributors for all construction services and supply construction materials, and a discontinued supply of such services and materials will adversely affect our construction projects. The Company is dependent on third-party subcontractors, manufacturers, and distributors for all construction services and supply construction materials. Construction services or products purchased from the Company’s five largest subcontractors/suppliers accounted for approximately 30% for the year ended December 31, 2009. A discontinued supply of such services and materials will adversely affect our construction projects. Intense competition from existing and new entities may adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In general, the property development industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with various companies. Many of our competitors are more established than we are and have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we presently possess. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and a larger customer base. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and customer requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to customers, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. We intend to create greater awareness for our brand name so that we can successfully compete with our competitors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively or successfully with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not harm our business. Our operating subsidiaries must comply with environmental protection laws that could adversely affect our profitability. We are required to comply with the environmental protection laws and regulations promulgated by the national and local governments of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”). Some of these regulations govern the level of fees payable to government entities providing environmental protection services and the prescribed standards relating to the constructions. Although our construction technologies allow us to efficiently control the level of pollution resulting from our construction process, due to the nature of our business, wastes are unavoidably generated in the processes. If we fail to comply with any of these environmental laws and regulations in the PRC, depending on the types and seriousness of the violation, we may be subject to, among other things, warning from relevant authorities, imposition of fines, specific performance and/or criminal liability, forfeiture of profits made, being ordered to close down our business operations, and suspension of relevant permits. 19 Our success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations. Our future success will depend in substantial part on the continued service of our senior management, including Mr. Lu Pingji, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. Feng Xiaohong, our Chief Executive Officer, and Ms. Lu Jing, our Chief Operating Officer. The loss of the services of one or more of our key people could impede implementation of our business plan and result in reduced profitability. We do not carry key person life or other insurance in respect of any of our officers or employees. Our future success will also depend on the continued ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified technical, sales and marketing, customer support, and other employees. Because of the rapid growth of the economy in the People’s Republic of China, competition for qualified people is intense. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our key people or that we will be able to attract, assimilate, or retain qualified people in the future. Risk Relating to the Residential Property Industry in China We are heavily dependent on the performance of the residential property market in China, which is at a relatively early development stage. The residential property industry in the PRC is still in a relatively early stage of development. Although demand for residential property in the PRC has been growing rapidly in recent years, such growth is often coupled with volatility in market conditions and fluctuation in property prices. It is extremely difficult to predict how much and when demand will develop, as many social, political, economic, legal, and other factors, most of which are beyond our control, may affect the development of the market. The level of uncertainty is increased by the limited availability of accurate financial and market information, as well as the overall low level of transparency in the PRC, especially in tier two cities, which have lagged in progress in these aspects when compared to tier one cities. The lack of a liquid secondary market for residential property may discourage investors from acquiring new properties. The limited amount of property mortgage financing available to PRC individuals may further inhibit demand for residential developments. We face intense competition from other real estate developers. The property industry in the PRC is highly competitive. In the tier two cities on which we focus, local and regional property developers are our major competitors, and an increasing number of large state-owned and private national property developers have started entering these markets. Many of our competitors, especially the state-owned and private national property developers, are well capitalized and have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we have. Some also have larger land banks, greater economies of scale, broader name recognition, a longer track record, and more established relationships in certain markets. In addition, the PRC government’s recent measures designed to reduce land supply further increased competition for land among property developers. Competition among property developers may result in increased costs for the acquisition of land for development, increased costs for raw materials, shortages of skilled contractors, oversupply of properties, decrease in property prices in certain parts of the PRC, a slowdown in the rate at which new property developments will be approved and or reviewed by the relevant government authorities, and an increase in administrative costs for hiring or retaining qualified personnel, any of which may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Furthermore, property developers that are better capitalized than we are may be more competitive in acquiring land through the auction process. If we cannot respond to changes in market conditions as promptly and effectively as our competitors, or effectively compete for land acquisition through the auction systems and acquire other factors of production, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. In addition, risk of property over-supply is increasing in parts of China, where property investment, trading, and speculation have become overly active. We are exposed to the risk that in the event of actual or perceived over-supply, property prices may fall drastically, and our revenue and profitability will be adversely affected. The PRC government may adopt further measures to curtail the overheating of the property sector. Along with the economic growth in China, investments in the property sectors have increased significantly in the past few years. In response to concerns over the scale of the increase in property investments, the PRC government has introduced policies to curtail property development. We believe the following regulations, among others, significantly affect the property industry in China. In May 2006, the Ministry of Construction, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), and other relevant PRC government authorities jointly issued the Opinions on Adjusting the Housing Supply Structure and Stabilizing the Property Prices, which introduced measures to limit resources allocated to the luxury residential market. For instance, the new measures require that at least 70 percent of a residential project must consist of units with a GFA of less than 90 square meters per unit, and the minimum amount of down payment was increased from 20 percent to 30 percent of the purchase price of the underlying property if it has a unit GFA of 90 square meters or more. In September 2007, PBOC and China Banking Regulatory Commission issued the Circular on Strengthening the Management of Commercial Real Estate Credit Facilities, which increased the minimum down payment for any purchase of second or subsequent residential property to 40 percent of the purchase price if the purchaser had obtained a bank loan to finance the purchase of his or her first property. In July 2006, the Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Commerce, NDRC, PBOC, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the State Administration for Foreign Exchange issued Opinions on Regulating the Entry and Administration of Foreign Investment in Real Property Market, which impose significant requirements on foreign investment in the PRC real estate sector. For instance, these opinions set forth requirements of registered capital of a foreign invested real property enterprise as well as thresholds for a foreign invested real property enterprise to borrow domestic or overseas loans. In addition, since June 2007, a foreign invested real property enterprise approved by local authorities is required to register such approvals with the Ministry of Commerce. 20 The PRC government’s restrictive regulations and measures to curtail the overheating of the property sector could increase our operating costs in adapting to these regulations and measures, limit our access to capital resources or even restrict our business operations. We cannot be certain that the PRC government will not issue additional and more stringent regulations or measures, which could further slow down property development in China and adversely affect our business and prospects. Our sales will be affected if mortgage financing becomes more costly or otherwise becomes less attractive. Substantially all purchasers of our residential properties rely on mortgages to fund their purchases. An increase in interest rates may significantly increase the cost of mortgage financing, thus affecting the affordability of residential properties. In 2009, PBOC did not change the lending rates. The benchmark lending rate for loans with a term of over five years, which affects mortgage rates, remained at 5.94 percent on December 31, 2009. The PRC government and commercial banks may also increase the down payment requirement, impose other conditions or otherwise change the regulatory framework in a manner that would make mortgage financing unavailable or unattractive to potential property purchasers. Under current PRC laws and regulations, purchasers of residential properties generally must pay at least 20 percent of the purchase price of the properties before they can finance their purchases through mortgages. In September 2007, the PRC government increased the minimum amount of down payment to 40 percent of the purchase price of the underlying property if such property is purchased as second property by any household who has not paid up previous mortgage. Moreover, the interest rate for bank loans of such purchase shall not be less than 110 percent of the PBOC benchmark rate of the same term and category. For further purchases of properties, there would be upward adjustments on the minimum down payment and interest rate for any bank loan. In addition, mortgagee banks may not lend to any individual borrower if the monthly repayment of the anticipated mortgage loan would exceed 50 percent of the individual borrower’s monthly income or if the total debt service of the individual borrower would exceed 55 percent of such individual’s monthly income. If the availability or attractiveness of mortgage financing is reduced or limited, many of our prospective customers may not be able to purchase our properties and, as a result, our business, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected. In line with industry practice, we provide guarantees to PRC banks with respect to loans procured by the purchasers of our properties for the total amount of mortgage loans. Such guarantees expire upon the completion of the registration of the mortgage with the relevant mortgage registration authorities. If there are changes in laws, regulations, policies, and practices that would prohibit property developers from providing guarantees to banks in respect of mortgages offered to property purchasers and as a result, banks would not accept any alternative guarantees by third parties, or if no third party is available or willing in the market to provide such guarantees, it may become more difficult for property purchasers to obtain mortgages from banks and other financial institutions during sales and pre-sales of our properties. Such difficulties in financing could result in a substantially lower rate of sale and pre-sale of our properties, which would adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations. We are not aware of any impending changes in laws, regulations, policies, or practices that will prohibit such practice in China. However, there can be no assurance that such changes in laws, regulations, policies, or practices will not occur in China in the future. Risks Related to China China’s economic policies could affect our business. Substantially all of our assets are located in China and substantially all of our revenue is derived from our operations in China. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects are subject, to a significant extent, to the economic, political, and legal developments in China. While China’s economy has experienced significant growth in the past 20 years, such growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall economy of China, but they may also have a negative effect on us. For example, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. The economy of China has been changing from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. In recent years the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform and the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of corporate governance in business enterprises; however, a substantial portion of productive assets in China are still owned by the Chinese government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. It also exercises significant control over China’s economic growth through the allocation of resources, the control of payment of foreign currency- denominated obligations, the setting of monetary policy, and the provision of preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Capital outflow policies in China may hamper our ability to remit income to the United States. China has adopted currency and capital transfer regulations. These regulations may require us to comply with complex regulations for the movement of capital. Although our directors believe that it is currently in compliance with these regulations, should these regulations or the interpretation of them by courts or regulatory agencies change; we may not be able to remit all income earned and proceeds received in connection with our operations or from the sale of our operating subsidiaries to our stockholders. 21 In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient foreign exchange to pay dividends or satisfy other foreign exchange requirements in the future. The fluctuation of the Renminbi may materially and adversely affect your investments. The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC’s political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation of the Renminbi may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and financial condition. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our common shares or for other business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against the Renminbi, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Renminbi we convert would be reduced. Any significant devaluation of Renminbi may reduce our operation costs in U.S. dollars but may also reduce our earnings in U.S. dollars. In addition, the depreciation of significant U.S. dollar denominated assets could result in a charge to our income statement and a reduction in the value of these assets. There can be no assurance that Renminbi will not be subject to devaluation. We may not be able to hedge effectively against Renminbi devaluation, so there can be no assurance that future movements in the exchange rate of Renminbi and other currencies will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient foreign exchange to pay dividends or satisfy other foreign exchange requirements in the future. It may be difficult to effect service of process and enforcement of legal judgments upon our company and our officers and directors because some of them reside outside the United States. As our operations are presently based in China and some of our key directors and officers reside outside the United States, service of process on our key directors and officers may be difficult to effect within the United States. Also, substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States and any judgment obtained in the United States against us may not be enforceable outside the United States. We have appointed Lu Pingji, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, as our agent to receive service of process in any action against our company in the United States. If relations between the United States and China worsen, our stock price may decrease, and we may have difficulty accessing the U.S. capital markets. At various times during recent years, the United States and China have had disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries. Any political or trade controversies between the United States and China could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to access U.S. capital markets. Cessation of the preferential rate of income tax may have an adverse impact on our net income. China passed a new PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementing rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (“EIT Law”) reduces the statutory rate of enterprise income tax from 33% to 25%, and permits companies established before March 16, 2007 to continue to enjoy their existing tax incentives, adjusted by certain transitional phase-out rules. However, our Company is not certified as a high-technology company as defined in the EIT law and administrative regulations implementing the EIT law. Therefore, our statutory rate of enterprise income tax rate is now 25%, which may adversely impact our net income and our financial condition. We may face obstacles from the communist system in China. Foreign companies conducting operations in China face significant political, economic, and legal risks. The political system in China, including a cumbersome bureaucracy, may hinder Western investment. We may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal, and financial controls in China. China historically has not adopted a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, modern banking, computer, or other control systems. We may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in China. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal, and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records, and instituting business practices that meet Western standards. It will be extremely difficult to acquire jurisdiction and enforce liabilities against our officers, directors, and assets based in China. Because the Company’s executive officers and directors, including, the chairman of its board of directors, are Chinese citizens, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to acquire jurisdiction over these persons in the event a lawsuit is initiated against us and or our officers and directors by a stockholder or group of stockholders in the United States. Also, because the majority of our assets are located in China, it would also be extremely difficult to access those assets to satisfy an award entered against it in a United States court. We may face judicial corruption in the People’s Republic of China. Another obstacle to foreign investment in the People’s Republic of China is corruption. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain recourse, if desired, through the People’s Republic of China’s poorly developed and sometimes corrupt judicial systems. Risks Related to Our Common Stock There is no assurance of an established public trading market, which would adversely affect the ability of shareholders in our company to sell their securities in the public markets. Although our common stock trades on the NASD’s automated quotation system (the “NASDAQ Stock Market”), a regular trading market for the securities may not be sustained in the future. Market prices for our common stock will be influenced by a number of factors, including: • the issuance of new equity securities; • changes in interest rates; • competitive developments, including announcements by competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; • variations in quarterly operating results; • change in financial estimates by securities analysts; • the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock; • investor perceptions of our company and the technologies industries generally; and • general economic and other national conditions. The limited prior public market and trading market may cause volatility in the market price of our common stock. Our common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “CHLN.” The quotation of our common stock on the NASDAQ does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market currently exists, and in recent years such market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many smaller companies like us. Our common stock is thus subject to volatility. In the absence of an active trading market: • investors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market quotations; • market visibility for our common stock may be limited; and • a lack of visibility for our common stock may have a depressive effect on the market for our common stock. 22 Our principal stockholders and current executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our company and will be able to exercise significant influence over our company. Our executive officers and directors and principal stockholders together will beneficially own a majority of the total voting power of our outstanding voting capital stock. These stockholders will be able to determine the composition of our Board of Directors, will retain the voting power to approve all matters requiring stockholder approval, and will continue to have significant influence over our affairs. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on the market price of the common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock. See “Principal Stockholders” for information about the ownership of common by our executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders. We do not anticipate paying dividends on the Common Stock. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Our directors intend to follow a policy of retaining all of our earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of our business. Our common stock could be considered to be a “penny stock.” Our common stock could be considered to be a “penny stock” if it meets one or more of the definitions in Rules 15g-2 through 15g-6 promulgated under Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These include but are not limited to the following: (i) the stock trades at a price less than $5.00 per share; (ii) it is NOT traded on a “recognized” national exchange; (iii) it is NOT quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market, or even if so, has a price less than $5.00 per share; or (iv) is issued by a company with net tangible assets less than $2.0 million, if in business more than a continuous three years, or with average revenues of less than $6.0 million for the past three years. The principal result or effect of being designated a “penny stock” is that securities broker-dealers cannot recommend the stock but must trade in it on an unsolicited basis. Broker-dealer requirements may affect trading and liquidity. Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 15g-2 promulgated there under by the SEC require broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor’s account. Potential investors in our common stock are urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares that are deemed to be “penny stock.” Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience, and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor’s financial situation, investment experience, and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise. Shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, as the future sale of a substantial amount of our restricted stock in the public marketplace could reduce the price of our common stock. From time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act (“Rule 144”), subject to certain limitations. The SEC has recently adopted amendments to Rule 144 which became effective on February 15, 2008. Under these amendments, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock or warrants for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale and (ii) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale. Persons who have beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock or warrants for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of either of the following: • 1% of the total number of securities of the same class then outstanding; or • the average weekly trading volume of such securities during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale; provided, in each case, that we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale. Such sales both by affiliates and by non-affiliates must also comply with the manner of sale, current public information and notice provisions of Rule 144 23
