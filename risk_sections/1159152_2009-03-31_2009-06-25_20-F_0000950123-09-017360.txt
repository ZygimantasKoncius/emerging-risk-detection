Term is automatically extended on 9th day of each February for an additional one year unless either party notifies the other, 90 days in advance of the automatic renewal date, that it does not want the term to renew. Base salary (1) $900,000 for fiscal year 2009. Salary reviewed annually by the Supervisory Board. Short-term incentive Annual short-term incentive target is 100% of annual base salary for the current year. The quantum of short-term incentive target is reviewed annually by the Supervisory Board. The Remuneration Committee recommends the Companys and Chief Executive Officers performance objectives, and the performance against these objectives, to the Supervisory Board for approval. The Chief Executive Officers short-term incentive is calculated under the Executive Incentive Plan (which includes the Individual Performance Plan). Long-term incentive Upon the approval of the shareholders, stock options or other equity incentive will be granted each year. The recommended number of options or other form of equity to be granted will be appropriate for this level of executive in the United States. Defined Contribution Plan The Chief Executive Officer may participate in the U.S. 401(k) defined contribution plan up to the annual IRS limit. The Company will match the Chief Executive Officers contributions into the plan up to the annual IRS limit. Resignation The Chief Executive Officer may cease employment with the Company by providing written notice. Termination by James Hardie The Company may terminate the Chief Executive Officers employment for cause or not for cause. If the Company terminates the employment, not for cause, or the Chief Executive Officer terminates his employment for good reason the Company will pay the following: a. amount equivalent to 1.5 times the Chief Executive Officers annual base salary at the time of termination; and b. amount equivalent to 1.5 times the Chief Executive Officers average short-term incentive actually paid in up to the previous three fiscal years as Chief Executive Officer; and c. continuation of health and medical benefits at the Companys expense for the remaining term of the agreement and consulting agreement referenced below. 91 Table of Contents Components Details Post-termination Consulting The Company will request the Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Executive Officer will agree, to consult to the Company upon termination for a minimum of two years, as long as the Chief Executive Officer maintains the Companys non-compete and confidentiality agreements and executes a release of claims following the effective date of termination. Under the consulting agreement, the Chief Executive Officer will receive the annual base salary and annual target incentive in exchange for this consulting and non-compete. Under the terms of equity incentive grants made to the Chief Executive Officer under the Managing Board Transitional Stock Option Plan and Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Chief Executive Officers outstanding options will not expire during any post-termination consulting period. This arrangement is a standard arrangement for U.S. executives and the Supervisory Board considers that it is an appropriate restraint for Mr. Gries given his intimate involvement in developing the Companys fiber cement business in the U.S. over the past 18 years.

Long-term incentive Upon the approval of the shareholders, stock options or other long-term equity with performance hurdles will be granted each year. The recommended value of equity to be granted will be equivalent to at least $350,000. If the Chief Financial Officer ceases employment with the Company then a pro-rata amount of each tranche of the Chief Financial Officers unvested options or other form of equity will expire on the date employment ceases, calculated based on the formula D=Cx(A/B), where A is the number of months from the date employment ceases to the first testing or vesting date, B is the number of months from the date of grant until the first testing or vesting date and C is the total number of options or other form of equity granted in the relevant tranche. The remaining unvested/unexercised options or other form of equity will continue as if the Chief Financial Officer remained employed by the Company until the first testing or vesting date, at which point any options or other form of equity that do not vest at that time will also lapse. Superannuation The Company will contribute 9% of gross salary to the Chief Financial Officers nominated superannuation fund. 92 Table of Contents Components Details Resignation or Termination The Company or Chief Financial Officer may cease the Chief Financial Officers employment with the Company by providing three months notice in writing.

Restricted stock units vesting is subject to performance hurdles as outlined in the plan rules. Stock-Based Compensation At March 31, 2009, we had the following equity award plans: the Executive Share Purchase Plan (which we refer to as the Plan); the 2005 Managing Board Transitional Stock Option Plan; the JHI NV 2001 Equity Incentive Plan; the 99 Table of Contents Supervisory Board Share Plan 2006 and the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006 as amended in 2008 (which we refer to as LTIP). Executive Share Purchase Plan Prior to July 1998, JHIL issued stock under the Plan. Under the terms of the Plan, eligible executives purchased JHIL shares at their market price when issued. Executives funded purchases of JHIL shares with non-recourse, interest-free loans provided by JHIL and collateralized by the shares. In such cases, the amount of indebtedness is reduced by any amounts payable by JHIL in respect of such shares, including dividends and capital returns. These loans are generally repayable within two years after termination of an executives employment. Variable plan accounting under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (which we refer to as APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, has been applied to the Executive Share Purchase Plan shares granted prior to April 1, 1995 and fair value accounting, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 123R, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, has been applied to shares granted after March 31, 1995. The Company recorded no compensation expense during the years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. No shares were issued under this plan during years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Managing Board Transitional Stock Option Plan The Managing Board Transitional Stock Option Plan provides an incentive to the members of the Managing Board. The maximum number of shares that may be issued and outstanding or subject to outstanding options under this plan without further shareholder approval is 1,320,000 shares. At March 31, 2009 and 2008, there were 1,320,000 options outstanding under this plan. On November 22, 2005, we granted options to purchase 1,320,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share equal to A$8.53 to the Managing Board directors under the Managing Board Transitional Stock Option Plan. As set out in the plan rules, the exercise price and the number of shares available on exercise may be adjusted on the occurrence of certain events, including new issues, share splits, rights issues and capital reconstructions. Fifty percent of these options become exercisable on the first business day on or after November 22, 2008 if the total shareholder returns (which we refer to as TSR) (essentially our dividend yield and common stock performance) from November 22, 2005 to that date were at least equal to the median TSR for the companies comprising our peer group, as set out in the plan. In addition, for each 1% increment that our TSR is above the median TSR, an additional 2% of the options become exercisable. If any options remain unvested on the last business day of each six month period following November 22, 2008 and November 22, 2010, we will reapply the vesting criteria to those options on that business day. Effect of Change in Control. The 2005 Managing Board Transitional Stock Option Plan provides for the automatic vesting of certain benefits under the plan under certain circumstances in the event of a change in control. A change in control will be deemed to have occurred if either (1) a person obtains at least 30% of our voting shares pursuant to a takeover bid for all or a proportion of all of our voting shares which is or becomes unconditional, (2) a scheme of arrangement or other merger proposal becomes binding on the holders of all of our voting shares and by reason of such scheme or proposal a person obtains at least 30% of our voting shares, or (3) a person becomes the beneficial owner of at least 30% of our voting shares for any other reason. JHI NV 2001 Equity Incentive Plan Under our 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, our employees, including employees of our subsidiaries and officers who are employees, but not including any member of our Managing Board or Supervisory Board, are eligible to receive awards in the form of nonqualified stock options, performance awards, restricted stock grants, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, phantom stock or other stock-based benefits such as restricted stock units. The 2001 Equity Incentive Plan is intended to promote our long-term financial interests by encouraging our management and other persons to acquire an ownership position in us, to align their interests with those of our shareholders and to encourage and reward their performance. The 2001 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by our shareholders and Joint Board subject to implementation of the consummation of our 2001 Reorganization. An aggregate of 45,077,100 shares of common stock have been made available for issuance under the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, provided that such number (and any awards granted) is subject to adjustment in the event of a stock 100 Table of Contents split, stock dividend or other changes in our common stock or capital structure or our restructuring. Our ADSs evidenced by ADRs and our common stock in the form of CUFS will be equivalent to and interchangeable with our common stock for all purposes of the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, provided that ADSs will be proportionately adjusted to account for the ratio of CUFS in relation to ADSs. The following number of options to purchase shares of our common stock issued under this plan were as follows: Options Outstanding as of Share Grant Date Number of Options Granted May 31, 2009 October 2001 (1) 5,468,829 510,342 December 2001 4,248,417 617,592 December 2002 4,037,000 838,000 December 2003 6,179,583 1,951,250 December 2004 5,391,100 2,093,625 February 2005 273,000 93,000 December 2005 5,224,100 2,550,000 March 2006 40,200 40,200 November 2006 3,499,490 1,856,885 March 2007 330,900 168,500 December 2007 5,031,310 3,238,642 Total outstanding 13,958,036 (1) Awarded to our employees on October 19, 2001 in exchange for the cancellation of JHIL shadow stock awards under the JHIL Key Management Equity Incentive Plan. The following number of restricted stock units issued under this plan were as follows: Number of Restricted Stock Restricted Stock Units Share Grant Date Units Granted vested as of May 31, 2009 June 2008 698,440  December 2008 992,271 24,052 Total 1,690,711 24,052 Our Remuneration Committee administers the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. Subject to the provisions of the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, our Remuneration Committee is authorized to determine who may participate in the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, the number and types of awards made to each participant and the terms, conditions and limitations applicable to each award. In addition, our Remuneration Committee will have the exclusive power to interpret the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan and to adopt such rules and regulations as it deems necessary or appropriate for purposes of administering the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. Subject to certain limitations, our Remuneration Committee will be authorized to amend, modify or terminate the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan to meet any changes in legal requirements or for any other purpose permitted by law. The purchase or exercise price of any award granted under the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan may be paid in cash or other consideration at the discretion of our Remuneration Committee. Our Remuneration Committee, in its discretion and as allowed by applicable laws, may allow cashless exercises of awards or may permit us to assist in the exercise of options. Stock Options. Under the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, our Remuneration Committee is authorized to award nonqualified options to purchase shares of common stock as additional employment compensation. The 2001 Equity Incentive Plan does not allow us to grant options qualified as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code. Options are exercisable over such periods as may be determined by our Remuneration Committee, but no stock option may be exercised after 10 years from the date of grant. Options may be exercisable in installments and upon such other terms as determined by our Remuneration Committee. Options are evidenced by notices of option grants authorized by our Remuneration Committee. No option is transferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to certain domestic relations orders. 101 Table of Contents Performance Awards. Our Remuneration Committee, in its discretion, may award performance awards to an eligible person contingent on the attainment of criteria specified by our Remuneration Committee. Performance awards are paid in the form of cash, shares of common stock or a combination of both. Our Remuneration Committee determines the total number of performance shares subject to an award, and the terms and the time at which the performance shares will be issued. Restricted Stock Awards. Our Remuneration Committee may award restricted shares of common stock, which are subject to forfeiture under such conditions and for such periods of time as our Remuneration Committee may determine. Restricted shares may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered so long as such shares remain restricted. Our Remuneration Committee determines the conditions or restrictions of any restricted stock awards, which may include requirements of continued employment, individual performance or our financial performance or other criteria. Stock Appreciation Rights. Remuneration Committee also may award stock appreciation rights either in tandem with an option or alone. Stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with a stock option may be granted at the same time as the stock option or at a later time. A stock appreciation right entitles the participant to receive from us an amount payable in cash, in shares of common stock or in a combination of cash and common stock, equal to the positive difference between the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise and the grant price, or such lesser amount as our Remuneration Committee may determine. Dividend Equivalent Rights. Dividend equivalent rights, defined as a right to receive payment with respect to all or some portion of the cash dividends that are or would be payable with respect to shares of common stock, may be awarded in tandem with stock options, stock appreciation rights or other awards under the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. Our Remuneration Committee determines the terms and conditions of these rights. The rights may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or other awards. Restricted Stock Units. In fiscal year 2009, the Joint Board and Remuneration Committee approved the issue of restricted stock units. Restricted stock units are unfunded and unsecured contractual entitlements for shares to be issued in the future and may be subject to time vesting or performance hurdles prior to vesting. On vesting, restricted stock units convert into shares. We granted 1,690,711 restricted stock units under this plan in the year ended March 31, 2009. As of March 31, 2009, there were 1,440,930 restricted stock units outstanding under this plan. Other Stock-Based Benefits. Our Remuneration Committee may award other benefits that, by their terms, might involve the issuance or sale of our common stock or other securities, or involve a benefit that is measured by the value, appreciation, dividend yield or other features attributable to a specified number of shares of our common stock or other securities, including but not limited to stock payments, stock bonuses and stock sales. Effect of Change in Control. The 2001 Equity Incentive Plan provides for the automatic acceleration of certain benefits and the termination of the plan under certain circumstances in the event of a change in control. A change in control will be deemed to have occurred if either (1) any person or group acquires beneficial ownership equivalent to 30% of our voting securities, (2) individuals who are members of our Supervisory Board as of the effective date of the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, or individuals who became members of our Supervisory Board after the effective date of the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan whose election or nomination for election was approved by at least a majority of such individuals (or, in the case of directors nominated by a person, entity or group with 20% of our voting securities, by two-thirds of such individuals) cease to constitute being at least a majority of the members of our Supervisory Board, or (3) there occurs the consummation of certain mergers (other than a merger that results in existing voting securities continuing to represent more than 5% of the voting power of the merged entity or a recapitalization or reincorporation that does not result in a material change in the beneficial ownership of the voting securities of the Company), the sale of substantially all of our assets or our complete liquidation or dissolution. Supervisory Board Share Plan 2006 At the 2006 AGM, our shareholders approved the replacement of our previous Supervisory Board Share Plan with a new plan also called the Supervisory Board Share Plan, and the participation of the Supervisory Board directors 102 Table of Contents under the Supervisory Board Share Plan for a three-year period. The Supervisory Board Share Plan was last approved at the 2007 AGM for a period of three years. Participation by members of the Supervisory Board in the Supervisory Board Share Plan is not mandatory. Under the Supervisory Board Share Plan, the Supervisory Board members can elect to receive some of their annual fees in the form of shares/CUFS. This is different from the old Supervisory Board Share Plan under which Supervisory Board members were required to contribute a portion of their annual fees in shares/CUFS. As of March 31, 2009, 79,342 shares had been acquired under this plan. Shares/CUFS received under the Supervisory Board Share Plan can be either issued or acquired on the open market. Where shares/CUFS are issued, the price is the average of the market closing prices at which CUFS were quoted to the ASX during the five business days preceding the day of issue. Where shares/CUFS are acquired on the open market, the price is the purchase price. The Supervisory Board Share Plan does not include a performance condition because the amounts applied to acquire shares/CUFS under the Supervisory Board Share Plan are from the annual fees earned by the Supervisory Board directors. Long-Term Incentive Plan At our 2006 AGM, our shareholders approved the establishment of the LTIP to provide incentives to members of the Managing Board and to certain members of its management or executives. The shareholders also approved, in accordance with certain LTIP rules, the issue of certain options or other rights over, or interest in, shares, the issue and/or transfer of shares under them, and the grant of cash awards to members of our Managing Board and executives. At our 2008 AGM, our shareholders amended the LTIP to also allow restricted stock units to be granted under the LTIP. In August 2007 and November 2006, 1,016,000 options and 1,132,000 options, and in September 2008, December 2008 and May 2009, 1,023,865, 545,757 and 1,066,595 restricted stock units, respectively, were granted under the LTIP to our Managing Board and to certain members of our management, respectively. The vesting of these equity awards are subject to performance hurdles as outlined in the LTIP rules. Unexercised options expire 10 years from the date of issue and restricted stock units expire on exercise, vesting or as set out in the LTIP rules. As of May 31, 2009, there were 2,148,000 options and 2,616,726 restricted stock units outstanding under this plan. Effect of Change in Control, Takeover by Certain Organizations or Liquidation. The LTIP provides for plan participants early exercise of certain benefits or early payout under the plan in the event of a change in control, takeover by certain organizations or liquidation. For options, a change in control is deemed to have occurred if pursuant to a takeover bid or otherwise, any person together with their associates acquire shares, which when aggregated with shares already acquired by such person and their associates, comprise more than 30% of our issued shares. For restricted stock units, a change of control is deemed to occur if (1) a takeover bid is made to acquire all of the shares of the Company and it is recommended by the Supervisory Board or becomes unconditional, (2) a transaction is announced which would result in one person owning all the issued shares in the Company, (3) a person owns or controls sufficient shares to enable them to influence the composition of the Supervisory Board, or (4) a similar transaction occurs which the Supervisory Board determines to be a control event. On a change of control, the Supervisory Board can determine that all or some restricted stock units have vested on any conditions it determines. Any remaining restricted stock units lapse. Other Compensation Economic Profit Incentive Plan During fiscal year 2008, we maintained an Economic Profit and Individual Performance Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the EP/IP Plan). This plan was a variable pay plan for our executive directors, officers, key executives and other eligible employees. Employees who had limited direct influence on the Companys financial performance were only eligible for incentive payments based on his or her individual performance on certain mutually agreed upon personal objectives. Executive directors, officers and key executives incentive payments were based on the Companys financial performance in addition to his or her individual performance on certain mutually agreed upon 103 Table of Contents personal objectives. All participants were eligible to receive incentive payments based on individual performance achievements regardless of the Companys performance. Targets for the Economic Profit component of the EP/IP Plan were set in 2006. The target setting did not anticipate the negative U.S. housing market growth in fiscal year 2008. Therefore, the Company did not achieve the target growth in Economic Profit in fiscal year 2008 and no payments were made under the Economic Profit component of the EP/IP Plan. Deferred Bonus Program After carefully assessing the senior executives response to and performance in the extreme market conditions facing the entire housing industry in the United States, the Supervisory Board concluded that executives performance was of such a standard that in this instance, an exceptional discretionary bonus was justified, and implemented the one-off Deferred Bonus Program in June 2008. Payments under this plan comprised of a cash payment equal to one third of the total value (short-term incentive) and a grant of two year vesting restricted stock units equal to two thirds of the value (long-term incentive) in June 2008. The total value of cash and restricted stock units under the Deferred Bonus Program was 75% of the short-term incentive target in fiscal year 2008, which therefore included an amount equal to 75% of the bonus bank the senior executive had accumulated for the Companys good performance in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Restricted stock units are unfunded and unsecured contractual entitlements for shares to be issued in the future. The restricted stock units granted in respect of the Deferred Bonus Program vest and convert into shares on a one-for-one basis in two years if the senior executive has maintained a satisfactory level of performance during this period, subject to exceptions based on the reasons for the recipients departure and other specified corporate events. The Chief Executive Officer was also a participant in this program and received a grant of restricted stock units in September 2008. As of May 29, 2009, there were 562,161 restricted stock units outstanding under the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to this program and 201,324 restricted stock units outstanding under the Long-Term Incentive Plan issued to the Chief Executive Officer. Executive Incentive Program and Individual Performance Plan In lieu of the EP/IP Plan, the Remuneration Committee recommended to our Supervisory Board that the Company maintain two variable pay plans effective April 1, 2008:  an Individual Performance Plan (which we refer to as the IP Plan), and  an Executive Incentive Program (which we refer to as EIP). The IP Plan contains the same terms as the Individual Performance component of the Companys previous EP/IP plan and is solely for eligible employees who have limited direct influence on the Companys financial performance. The IP Plan is based on the individuals performance on certain mutually agreed upon personal objectives. The EIP contains a corporate component which will reward management based on performance against predetermined Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (which we refer to as EBIT) goals which are adopted at the start of each fiscal year, as well as individual components on the same terms as the IP Plan which will reward management based on strategic financial and individual objectives. Participating employees will have different EBIT and individual goals, depending on their function and location. The Remuneration Committee and the Chief Executive Officer have the joint authority and discretion to make payments due under this plan in a form of equity for any given fiscal year. Fiscal year 2009 bonuses under the EIP and IP plan were paid in cash as per the plan. In March 2009, the Supervisory Board amended the EIP and IP Plan to allow bonuses from fiscal year 2010 awards to be paid in stock. 104 Table of Contents 401(k) Plan We sponsor a U.S. defined contribution plan, the James Hardie Retirement and Profit Sharing Plan, for our employees in the United States and a defined benefit pension plan, the James Hardie Australia Superannuation Plan, for our employees in Australia. The U.S. defined contribution plan is a tax-qualified retirement and savings plan (which we refer to as the 401(k) Plan) covering all U.S. employees, subject to certain eligibility requirements. Participating employees may elect to reduce their current annual compensation by up to $16,500 in calendar year 2009 and have the amount of such reduction contributed to the 401(k) Plan, with a maximum eligible compensation limit of $245,000. In addition, we match employee contributions dollar for dollar up to a maximum of the first 6% of an employees eligible compensation. James Hardie Australia Superannuation Plan The James Hardie Australia Superannuation Plan is funded based on statutory requirements in Australia and is based primarily on the contributions and income derived thereon held by the plan on behalf of the member, and to a lesser degree, on the participants eligible compensation and years of credited service. Under Australian law, employees do not have to belong to their employers superannuation fund. Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions Major Shareholders As of May 31, 2009, all issued and outstanding shares of our common stock were listed on the ASX in the form of CHESS Units of Foreign Securities, or CUFS.
