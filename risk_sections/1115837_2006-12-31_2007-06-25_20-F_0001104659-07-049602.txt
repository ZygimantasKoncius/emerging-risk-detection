D. Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Overview We are the largest mobile operator in Russia, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and the second largest in Ukraine in terms of subscribers and revenues, according to AC&M-Consulting. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, were $6,384.3 million, an increase of 27.4% from the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $1,075.7 million, down 4.5% from the year ended December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had a subscriber base of 72.9 million (51.2 million in Russia, 20.0 million in Ukraine, 1.5 million in Uzbekistan and 0.2 million in Turkmenistan). Our revenues have increased through organic growth, as well as through acquisitions. During March to July 2003, we acquired 100% of UMC, a mobile operator in Ukraine, for approximately $378.3 million in cash and assumed debt of UMC in the amount of $62.0 million. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, UMC accounted for approximately 24.0% and 23.3%, respectively, of our total revenues. We acquired a 74% stake in Uzdunrobita, a mobile operator in Uzbekistan, in August 2004, and Uzdunrobitas results of operations have been included in our audited consolidated financial statements beginning July 2004. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, Uzdunrobita had total revenues of $86.5 million and $136.7 million, respectively. In two separate purchases in June and 72 November 2005, we acquired 100% of BCTI, a mobile operator in Turkmenistan, for $46.7 million in cash. BCTIs results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since June 30, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2006, BCTI had total revenues of $105.8 million. We spent $355.7 million, $178.9 million and $38.2 million in cash (net of cash acquired) in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, to acquire businesses. We require significant funds to support our subscriber growth, primarily for increasing network capacity and developing networks in new license areas. Our cash outlays for capital expenditures (consisting of purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets) in 2004, 2005 and 2006 were $1,358.9 million, $2,181.3 million and $1,722.0 million, respectively. We have financed our cash requirements through our operating cash flows and borrowings. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004, 2005 and 2006 was $1,711.6 million, $1,803.6 million and $2,389.9 million, respectively. Since 2002, we have raised a total of $1.8 billion through six U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured notes offerings in international capital markets. In April 2006, we entered into a syndicated loan facility with several international financial institutions, allowing us to borrow up to $1,330.0 million in two tranches of $630.0 million and $700.0 million, of which $860.0 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had total indebtedness of approximately $3.1 billion, including capital lease obligations, compared to approximately $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2005. Our total interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, was $132.5 million and $177.1 million, net of amounts capitalized, respectively. We hold a 49% equity investment in a mobile operator in Belarus, MTS Belarus, which had 3.2 million subscribers as of December 31, 2006. MTS Belarus is an equity investment, and its results are not consolidated in our financial statements, but instead are accounted for in our equity in net income of associates. The remaining stake in MTS Belarus is owned by a Belarus state-owned enterprise. Segments Prior to January 1, 2005, we had several operating segments corresponding to separate legal entities within our group. For reporting purposes, we grouped them as follows: (1) our company, Mobile TeleSystems OJSC, or MTS OJSC, which holds licenses for and operates in the Moscow license area and a number of areas outside of Moscow; (2) our subsidiary, Telecom XXI, which held licenses for and operates in St. Petersburg and a number of areas in northwest Russia; (3) our subsidiary, Kuban-GSM, which held licenses for and operates in the Krasnodar region of Russia (4) our subsidiary, UMC, which holds licenses for and operates in Ukraine; and (5) several other smaller subsidiaries, which hold licenses for and operate in the different regions of Russia and our subsidiary, Uzdunrobita, which holds licenses for and operates in Uzbekistan, which we call Other regions. Pursuant to a reorganization beginning in 2004, we separated our operations in Russia by geographic region, or macro-regions, rather than by legal entity as described above. To accomplish this restructuring, we merged many of our majority-owned subsidiaries in order to consolidate our administrative functions and improve management efficiency. Furthermore, in July 2005, we merged with eight of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Russia, including Telecom XXI, Kuban-GSM, Udmurtia Digital Network-900, or UDN-900, Dontelecom, MTS-Barnaul, MTS-Nizhny Novgorod, or MTS-NN, Telecom-900 and Amur Cellular Communication, or ACC. In April 2006, we merged with an additional nine of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Russia: Gorizont-RT, TAIF Telcom, MTS-RTK, Sibchallenge, Tomsk Cellular Communications, or TSS, BM Telekom, Far East Cellular Systems-900, or FECS-900, Siberian Cellular Systems-900, or SCS-900, and Uraltel. In April 2007, the Russian authorities approved the merger of our wholly-owned subsidiaries ReCom and Telesot Alania with us. 73 In August 2006, we decided to structure each of the macro-regions in Russia under one governing body entitled MTS Russia as each of the macro-regions in Russia possesses similar operational characteristics and economic environment. We review on a separate basis each of the other countries where we operate due to each countrys different geographical, economic and regulatory environment. Furthermore, each country where we operate requires its own unique marketing and investment strategies. See Note 24 to our audited consolidated financial statements for segment information. Subscriber Data The following table shows our subscribers by country as of the dates indicated: At December 31, 2004 2005 2006 (in thousands) Subscribers(1) Russia 26,540 44,219 51,222 Ukraine 7,373 13,327 20,003 Uzbekistan 311 580 1,450 Turkmenistan  68 184 Total consolidated 34,224 58,194 72,859 MTS Belarus (unconsolidated) 1,214 2,134 3,208 (1) We define a subscriber as an individual or organization whose account shows chargeable activity within 61 days (or 183 days in the case of our pre-paid tariffs) or whose account does not have a negative balance for more than this period. We had approximately 51.2 million subscribers in Russia at December 31, 2006, of which 11.2 million were in the Moscow license area that encompasses the City of Moscow and the Moscow region. According to AC&M-Consulting, approximately 18.0% of all mobile cellular subscribers in Russia reside in the Moscow license area, where penetration by active SIM card stood at approximately 156.4% as of December 31, 2006. Overall penetration in Russia was lower, at approximately 104.6%, according to AC&M-Consulting. Our subscribers in Russia outside of the Moscow license area totaled approximately 40.0 million as of December 31, 2006. According to AC&M-Consulting, as of December 31, 2006, we had a leading 33.7% market share of total mobile cellular subscribers in Russia. Our market share in the Moscow license area was approximately 42.2% as of December 31, 2006, according to AC&M-Consulting. We had approximately 20.0 million subscribers in Ukraine as of December 31, 2006, and, according to AC&M-Consulting, a 40.6% market share of total mobile cellular subscribers in Ukraine. In addition, we had approximately 1.5 million subscribers in Uzbekistan, representing a 57.9% market share, according to our estimates. We define our churn as the total number of subscribers who cease to be a subscriber during the period (whether involuntarily due to non-payment or voluntarily, at such subscribers request), expressed as a percentage of the average number of our subscribers during that period. We view the subscriber churn as a measure of market competition and customer dynamics. The following table shows our Russian and Ukrainian subscriber churn for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Subscriber Churn Russia 27.5 % 20.7 % 23.3 % Ukraine 15.8 % 21.8 % 29.9 % The churn rate is highly dependent on competition in our license areas and those subscribers who migrate as a result of such competition. The increase in our churn rate in Russia during 2006 occurred 74 mainly due to aggressive pricing policies and promotions undertaken by our competitors. The churn rate in Ukraine has increased significantly due to increased competition with Vimpelcom and Astelit during 2006. While our subscribers and revenues have been growing, our average monthly service revenue per subscriber has been decreasing. We calculate our average monthly service revenue per subscriber by dividing our service revenues for a given period, including guest roaming and interconnect fees, by the average number of our subscribers during that period and dividing by the number of months in that period. The following table shows our average monthly service revenue per Russian and Ukrainian subscriber and average monthly minutes of use per Russian and Ukrainian subscriber for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Average monthly service revenue per subscriber Russia(1) $ 12 $ 8 $ 8 Ukraine $ 13 $ 10 $ 7 Average monthly minutes of use per subscriber Russia 157 128 129 Ukraine 114 117 142 (1) As of June 30, 2006, we changed the methodology for reporting average revenue per user for our Russian subscribers, a common calculation used throughout the telecommunications industry as a measure of company effectiveness and performance. Whereas previously we had excluded interconnect fees, we now include all network revenue in our calculation. Despite the change in methodology, the average monthly service revenue per subscriber in Russia in 2004 would remain the same because of the insignificant amount of interconnect revenues generated for that year. Average monthly service revenue per subscriber in Russia decreased from $12 for the year ended December 31, 2004, to $8 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006. In 2005, average monthly service revenue per subscriber and average monthly minutes of use per subscriber in Russia decreased due to strong competition and a more diverse subscriber base. In 2006, the average monthly service revenue per subscriber and average monthly minutes of use per subscriber in Russia stabilized. In Ukraine, average monthly service revenue per subscriber decreased from $10 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $7 for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to competitive pressures on price levels. Average monthly minutes of use per subscriber in Ukraine increased from 117 minutes in 2005 to 142 minutes in 2006 due to the introduction of subscriber tariffs aimed at stimulating traffic, such as inexpensive intra-network rates. The following table shows the mix between prepaid and other subscribers, such as contract and corporate customers, for Russia and Ukraine for the periods indicated.
