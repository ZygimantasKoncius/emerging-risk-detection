ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We face risks in operating our business, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Risks relating to our business and industry include, among others: our ability to attract new customers; our ability to maintain our gross margin of petroleum products and petroleum product purchases, and competition and competitive factors in the markets in which we compete. See below for additional information on risks related to our business. Risks Related to Our Business ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING PRODUCTION LEVELS OF CRUDE OIL/PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGIN. Our ability to pay company expenses depends primarily on our gross margin. The gross margin is the difference between the sales price of our products, which include gasoline, diesel, kerosene and fuel oil, and the cost of the products that we purchase. These include handling charges, transportation and refinery costs. The ability to generate margins in the petroleum marketing and trading business is not tied to the absolute - 5 - price of crude oil, but is generated by differences between the price at which crude oil and our petroleum products are sold and the price paid, as well as other costs incurred in the purchase, refining and transportation of our petroleum products. In addition, our gross margins are affected by many factors beyond our control, including: o the performance of the Chinese economy and the global economy: o the volumes of crude oil and petroleum products produced in the areas we serve: o the demand for petroleum products by our customers: o the prices of crude oil and refined products (diesel and gasoline): o petroleum products sold by our competitors: o the competitive position of alternative energy sources and: o the availability of crude oil/petroleum products from our suppliers. IF WE CANNOT MAINTAIN OUR SUPPLY OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, IT WILL AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO PAY OUR DEBT AND COMPANY EXPENSES. Our profitability depends in part on our ability to maintain supply of our products. The amount of drilling and production will depend in large part on crude oil prices. To the extent that low crude oil/petroleum prices result in lower volumes of crude oil/petroleum products available for purchase, we may experience shortages of our product. In addition, a sustained depression in crude oil/petroleum prices could result in the bankruptcy of some of our suppliers and refineries. OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE OUR PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOW WILL DEPEND ON OUR SUCCESS IN MAKING WISE DECISIONS REGARDING SOURCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. Our skill in purchasing, handling, transporting and storing our products, and our ability to respond to changes in the market will affect our profitability and cash flow. The marketing and trading of our petroleum products requires detailed current knowledge of our petroleum products suppliers and customers, and a familiarity with a number of factors, including: o individual customer demand for specific grades of petroleum: o area market price structures for the different grades of petroleum products: o location of our customers: o availability of transportation facilities, and o timing of purchases and costs involved in delivering our products to our customers. WE DEPEND ON A FEW SUPPLIERS FOR MOST OF OUR SUPPLIES. THEREFORE, THE LOSS OF ANY SUPPLIER CAN HAVE AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS Historically, our five largest suppliers which currently constitute 10% or greater of the Company's purchasing volume are: Company 2008 2007 Yanlian Industry Group selling division 11.23% 26% Tuha Oil Exploring and Exploiting Headquarters 13.29% 20% Xian Oil Chemical Assembling Factory 4.9% 11% Alashankou Baoli Trading Company Limited 8.7% 10% Alashankou Dacheng Company Limited 1.01% 10% Tianjin Dagang Jingyu Industry Company Limited 13.29% 9% Panjin Jinjiang Oil Chemical Company Limited 22.07% 7% - 6 - The loss of any supplier could adversely affect our ability to get our petroleum products, thus affecting our sales and profitability. CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATORY COSTS COULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND PROFIT. Under its current leadership, the Chinese Government has been pursuing environmental reform policies. Changes in environmental regulation could put restrictions and limitations on some of our storage, transportation and handling activities that may impact the environment. This could include disposal of waste, handling of chemical substances, and storing of our petroleum products. Those policies that place environmental restrictions and limitations on our business would increase our operating costs for us, and for our suppliers. We will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed, and to plan accordingly in order to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. IN THE EVENT THAT WE LOSE OUR LICENCES GRANTED BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WE WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS. We have been granted a Finish Oil Wholesale license, which allows our company to sell petroleum products to other wholesales and users of gasoline, fuel oil and diesel oil. This license is granted by the Peoples Republic of China In addition, we also have a special license for Dangerous Chemical Products Businesses that allows us to handle or transport gasoline and diesel oil. There is no expiration date on the Finish Oil Wholesale license but this could be changed by the Chinese government under the condition that we no longer have adequate storage facilities or equipment to carry out our business. The Dangerous Chemical Products Businesses license is renewed every three years. The Peoples Republic of Chinas constitution states that all mineral and oil resources belong to the State. Without these licenses, we would not be allowed to sell our products and we would be unable to survive i n our present business. THE CHINA GOVERNMENT MIGHT EXPAND AND GRANT LICENSES TO BUY DIRECTLY FROM REFINERIES TO OTHER WHOLESALERS IN OUR REGION. The Chinese government recently has begun granting licenses to other wholesalers this will have a negative affect on our agency fees or a fee that is charged to other wholesalers that do not have a license to purchase directly from refineries. Our agency fees represented 6.8% of our sales in year ending June 30, 2008 and 8.3% of our sales in June 30, 2007. A decrease in our agency fees will have a negative impact on both sales and profits. OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE, WHICH MAKES OUR RESULTS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND COULD CAUSE OUR RESULTS TO FALL SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS. Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Therefore, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may be significantly different from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. THE LOSS OF OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OR ANY INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR EXPAND OUR BUSINESS. - 7 - Cai Yongjun, our Chief Executive Officer, founded Taiyuan Longwei in 1995. In China, business is often driven by personal relationships, and many of our customers and suppliers have been working with Mr. Cai for many years. For this reason, we believe our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of Mr. Cai, and we would be at a severe competitive disadvantage if we were to lose his services. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers, including Mr. Cai, and have no current plans to purchase any in the future. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel to oversee our operations and to insure that we continue to supply our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner. IF WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL RESOURCES OR OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPANSION, OUR GROWTH WILL BE LIMITED. We will require additional working capital to support our long-term business plan, which includes increasing our storage capacity by buying additional storage tanks. Our working capital requirements and the cash flow provided by future operating activities will vary from quarter to quarter, depending on the volume of business during the period and payment terms with our customers. We may not be able to obtain adequate levels of additional financing, whether through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources. Additional financings could result in significant dilution to our earnings per share or the issuance of securities with rights superior to our current outstanding securities. In addition, we may grant registration rights to investors purchasing our equity or debt securities in the future. If we are unable to raise additional financing, we may be unable to implement our long-term business plan of ad ding additional storage capacity to meet customer demand for our products, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures on a timely basis, if at all. WE SOMETIMES EXTEND CREDIT TO OUR CUSTOMERS. FAILURE TO COLLECT THE TRADE RECEIVABLES OR UNTIMELY COLLECTION COULD AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY. We extend credit to some of our customers while requiring no collateral. Generally, our customers pay within 30 days of delivery. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and usually have no difficulties in collecting our payments. However, if we encounter future problems collecting amounts due from our clients, or if we experience delays in the collection of amounts due from our clients, our liquidity could be negatively affected. OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO PRICING VOLATILITY OF THE PETROLEUM MARKETS. Many of our petroleum and fuel-oriented products are commodities which are refined and distributed by numerous sources. We purchase fuel delivered to our customers from multiple suppliers at market prices. We monitor fuel prices and trends in each of our markets on a daily basis and seek to purchase our supply at the lowest prices and under the most favorable terms. Commodity price risk is mitigated since we purchase and deliver our fuel supply daily and utilize cost-plus pricing to our customers. If we cannot pass on the cost-plus pricing to our customers, margins would decrease and a loss could be incurred. We have not engaged in derivatives or futures trading to hedge fuel price movements. In addition, diesel fuel, gasoline and propane may be subject to supply interruption due to a number of factors, including natural disasters, refinery and/or pipeline outages and labor disruptions. The reduction of available supplies could impact our ability to provide bulk-fueling services and impact our profitability. SUDDEN OIL AND GAS PRICE INCREASES DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR INABILITY TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE QUANTITIES FROM OUR USUAL SUPPLIERS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. - 8 - Our profitability in the fuel distribution business is largely dependent on the difference between our wholesale cost and retail price. Our products are a commodity, and the unit price we pay is subject to volatile changes in response to changes in supply or other market conditions over which we have no control. The supply from our usual sources may be interrupted due to reasons that are beyond our control. As a result, the cost of acquiring our fuels from other suppliers might be materially higher, at least on a short-term basis. Since we may not be able to pass on to our customers immediately, or in full, all increases in the wholesale cost of fuel, these increases could reduce our profitability. ENERGY EFFICIENCY, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES HAVE AFFECTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY OUR CUSTOMERS. The national trend toward increased conservation and technological advances, including fuel-efficient vehicles, may adversely affect the demand for our products and services by our customers which, in turn, may result in lower sales volumes to our customers. In addition, recent economic conditions may lead to additional conservation by customers to further reduce their fuel consumption. Future technological advances in conservation and fuel consumption may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. WE HAVE VERY FEW WRITTEN AGREEMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR CUSTOMERS COULD TERMINATE OUR SERVICES AT ANY TIME AND FOR ANY REASON. We do not have formal length of service written contracts with the majority of our customers. As a result, most of our customers can terminate our services at any time and for any reason, and we can similarly discontinue service to any customer. We may discontinue service to a customer if changes in the service conditions or other factors cause us not to meet our minimum level of margins and rates, and the pricing or delivery arrangements cannot be re-negotiated. As a result of this absence of written agreements, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we were to experience a high rate of customer losses. WE ARE SUBJECT TO OPERATING HAZARDS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS TO THE EXTENT NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. Our operations are subject to operating hazards and risks normally associated with handling, storing and delivering combustible liquids such as oil, gasoline and propane. As a result, we may be subject to claims related to these operating hazards arising in the ordinary course of business. We do carry business insurance but we cannot guarantee that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage, or that these levels of insurance will be available at economical prices. OUR GROWTH COULD STRAIN OUR PERSONNEL AND INFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCES, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN. We are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth, which has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, and operational and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth efficiently. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan. - 9 - WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY. We compete with other fuel providers, including several national, regional, and numerous small independent operators who provide these products. Many of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do. Our ability to compete is dependent on numerous factors, including price, delivery dependability, credit terms, service locations, and quality. OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE OVER OUR BUSINESS AND THEIR INTERESTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE INTERESTS OF OTHER SHAREHOLDERS. Our principal shareholders are Cai Yongjun, our CEO and Chairman, and Xue Yongping, our Secretary and a director, who each beneficially own 34,500,000, or a total of 69,000,000 of our common stock, or approximately 91% of our voting stock. Therefore, Mr. Cai and Mr. Xue have the ability to substantially influence the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval (including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all, or substantially all of our assets), and to control our management and affairs. Accordingly, such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. RISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL UNCERTAINTIES IN CHINA COULD HARM OUR FUTURE INTERESTS IN CHINA. All of our future business projects and plans are expected to be located in China. As a consequence, the economic, political, legal and social conditions in China could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The legislative trend in China over the past decade has been to enhance the protection afforded to foreign investment and to allow for more active control by foreign parties of foreign invested enterprises. There can be no assurance, however, that legislation directed towards promoting foreign investment will continue. More restrictive rules on foreign investment could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations in China or repatriate any profits earned there. Some of the changes that could adversely affect us include: - level of government involvement in the economy; - control of foreign exchange; - methods of allocating resources; - balance of payments position; - international trade restrictions; and - international conflicts The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, in many ways. As a result of these differences, we may not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected if the Chinese economy were similar to those of the OECD member countries. - 10 - THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT IN CHINA IS UNCERTAIN AND YOUR ABILITY TO LEGALLY PROTECT YOUR INVESTMENT COULD BE LIMITED. The Chinese legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which precedents set in earlier legal cases are not generally used. The overall effect of legislation enacted over the past 20 years has been to enhance the protections afforded to foreign-owned enterprises in China. However, these laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent and are evolving rapidly, and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties. For example, on March 16, 2007, the PRC adopted new property and corporate income tax laws, and the implications of these new laws are uncertain as of the date of this report. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to foreign investors, such as the right of foreign-invested enterprises to hold licenses and permits such as requisite business licenses. In addition, all of our executive officers and our directors are reside nts of China and not of the United States, and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to effect service of process in the United States, or to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against us or any of these persons. BECAUSE OUR PRINCIPAL ASSETS ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND ALL OF OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS RESIDE OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS BASED ON U.S. FEDERALSECURITIES LAWS AGAINST US AND OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE U.S. OR TO ENFORCE A U.S.COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST US OR THE M IN THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA. All of our directors and officers reside outside of the U.S. In addition, Taiyuan Longwei, our operating subsidiary, is located in the Peoples Republic of China and substantially all of its assets are located outside of the U.S. It may therefore be difficult or impossible for investors in the U.S. to enforce their legal rights based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us in the courts of either the U.S. or the Peoples Republic of China and, even if civil judgments are obtained in U.S. courts, to enforce such judgments in the Peoples Republic of China courts. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the U.S. and the Peoples Republic of China would permit effective enforcement against us or our officers and directors of criminal penalties, under the U.S. federal securities laws or otherwise. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT EXERTS SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE OVER THE MANNER IN WHICH WE MUST CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. China has only recently permitted provincial and local economic autonomy and private economic activities. The Chinese government has exercised, and continues to exercise, substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to renew our Dangerous Chemical Products Business license or our Finish Oil Wholesale license, licenses which allow our company to handle gasoline and oil and to engage in the wholesale business of gasoline, diesel oil and kerosene respectively, would have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, returning to a more centrally planned economy, or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures. - 11 - FUTURE INFLATION IN CHINA MAY INHIBIT OUR ACTIVITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS IN CHINA. In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and widely fluctuating rates of inflation. During the past ten years, the rate of inflation in China has been as high as 20.7% and as low as -2.2%. These factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby impact the cost of crude oil and petroleum products affecting our cost and perhaps demand for our products. RESTRICTIONS ON CURRENCY EXCHANGE MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE AND USE OUR REVENUES EFFECTIVELY. The majority of our revenues will be settled in RMB, and any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenue generated in RMB to fund any future business activities outside China or to make dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including the restriction that foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell, or remit foreign currencies after providing valid commercial documents, and only at those banks in China authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. We cannot be certain that in the future the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the Company's ability to convert RMB into the U.S. dollar. THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLARS AND RENMINBI. The value of our common stock will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB, and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for our operational needs, should the RMB appreciate against the U.S. dollar at that time, our financial position, the business of our Company, and the price of our common stock may be harmed. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of declaring dividends on our common stock or for other business purposes, should the U.S. dollar appreciate against the RMB, the U.S. dollar equivalent of our earnings from our subsidiaries in China would be reduced. ACCOUNTING LAWS IN CHINA MANDATE ACCOUNTING PRACTICES WHICH MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THEREFORE OUR FINANCIALS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION INVOLVE UNCERTAINTIES. The PRC accounting laws require an annual statutory audit to be performed in accordance with PRC accounting standards and the books of foreign invested enterprises to be maintained in accordance with Chinese accounting laws. These Chinese accounting practices may not be consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Article 14 of the PRC Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law requires a wholly foreign-owned enterprise to submit certain periodic fiscal reports and statements to designated financial and tax authorities. Noncompliance with such requirements may cause revocation of our business license. The translation of the financial statements from the requirements of the PRC to US GAAP requires interpretation and exercise of judgment. - 12 - ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
