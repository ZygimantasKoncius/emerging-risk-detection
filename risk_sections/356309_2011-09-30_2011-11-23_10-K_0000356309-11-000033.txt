ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) NJR costs of compliance with present and future environmental laws are significant and could adversely affect its cash flows and profitability.NJR's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and site remediation. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require NJR to expend significant financial resources to, among other things, conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring. If NJR fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if it is unable to do so due to factors beyond its control, it may be subject to civil liabilities or criminal penalties and may be required to incur significant expenditures to come into compliance. Additionally, any alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations may require NJR to expend significant resources in its defense against alleged violations.Furthermore, the United States Congress has for some time been considering various forms of climate change legislation. There is a possibility that, when and if enacted, the final form of such legislation could impact NJR's costs and put upward pressure on wholesale natural gas prices. Higher cost levels could impact the competitive position of natural gas and negatively affect our growth opportunities, cash flows and earnings.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None
