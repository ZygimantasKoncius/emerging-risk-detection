Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Any investment in our company will be subject to risks inherent to our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or focused on or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related To Our Business Our Financial Results Have Varied And May Continue To Vary Significantly From Quarter To Quarter And We May Fail To Meet Analysts And Investors Expectations. Our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past, and we expect our operating results to continue to vary from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Although our revenues are subject to fluctuation, significant portions of our expenses are not variable in the short term, such as our lease and purchase commitments. If we cannot reduce expenses quickly to respond to decreases in revenues, a revenue shortfall is likely to adversely and disproportionately affect our operating results. These factors have caused our operating results to be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in the past and may do so again in the future. We Have Historically Experienced Negative Cash Flows. A Failure To Maintain Profitability And Achieve Consistent Positive Cash Flows Would Have A Significant Adverse Effect On Our Business, Impair Our Ability To Support Our Operations And Adversely Affect Our Liquidity. We experienced negative cash flows during the quarter ended September 30, 2006, the quarter ended March 31, 2006 and each of the five years ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to sharp declines in our revenues and our historical inability to reduce our expenses to a level at or below the level of our revenues. A failure to maintain profitability and achieve consistent positive cash flows could impair our ability to support our operations, adversely affect our liquidity and threaten our ability to repay our debts when they come due. 8 Table of Contents Negative cash flows and the adverse market perception associated therewith may negatively affect our ability to sell our products and maintain existing customer relationships, and may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on advantageous terms. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining an adequate level of cash resources and we may be forced to act more aggressively in the future in the area of expense reduction in order to conserve cash resources. We May Require Additional Private Or Public Debt Or Equity Financing. Such Financing May Only Be Available On Disadvantageous Terms, Or May Not Be Available At All. Any New Financing Could Have A Substantial Dilutive Effect On Our Existing Stockholders. At December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of $109.4 million and a working capital balance of $17.4 million. Our cash position may decline in the future, and we may not be successful in maintaining an adequate level of cash resources. We had $86.3 million in face value of our 5% senior convertible notes outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Holders of our 5% senior convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the senior convertible notes on November 15, 2010 and may convert the senior convertible notes at any time on or after May 15, 2010. In addition, holders of the senior convertible notes may convert the senior convertible notes prior to May 15, 2010 upon the occurrence of any of the following events:  if the senior convertible notes have been called for redemption;  upon certain dividends or distributions to all holders of our common stock;  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions constituting a fundamental change (the occurrence of a change in control or a termination of trading, each as defined in the indenture governing our senior convertible notes);  if the average of the trading prices for the senior convertible notes during any five consecutive trading-day period is less than 98% of the average of the conversion values for the senior convertible notes (the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate) during that period; or  at any time after May 15, 2008 if the closing sale price of our common stock is equal to or greater than $23.21 for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. Upon conversion of the senior convertible notes, we will be required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the senior convertible notes to be converted in cash, with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock. We may be required to seek private or public debt or equity financing in order to support our operations, satisfy the conversion obligation with respect to our senior convertible notes and/or repay our senior convertible notes. The debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the indenture governing our senior convertible notes could restrict or impede our ability to incur additional debt. We may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, and any new financing could have a substantial dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. Our 5% Senior Convertible Notes Contain Covenants That Restrict The Incurrence Of Additional Indebtedness. The indenture governing our 5% senior convertible notes contains a debt incurrence covenant that places restrictions on the amount and type of additional indebtedness that we can incur. Such covenant specifies that we shall not, and that we shall not permit any of our subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, incur or guarantee or assume any indebtedness other than permitted indebtedness. Permitted indebtedness is defined in the indenture 9 Table of Contents to include, among others, the following categories of indebtedness: (i) all indebtedness outstanding on November 23, 2005; (ii) indebtedness under our 5% senior convertible notes; (iii) indebtedness under our $15.0 million letter of credit line; (iv) between $25.0 million and $50.0 million of additional senior secured indebtedness (the maximum permitted amount to be determined by application of a formula contained in the indenture); and (v) at least $100.0 million of additional subordinated indebtedness (the maximum permitted amount to be determined by application of a formula contained in the indenture). The debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the indenture governing our senior convertible notes could restrict or impede our ability to incur additional debt, which in turn could impair our ability to support our operations, adversely affect our liquidity and threaten our ability to repay our debts when they become due. If We Are Unable To Develop And Generate Additional Demand For Our Products, Serious Harm Could Result To Our Business. We have invested significant resources in developing and marketing our products and services. The demand for, and market acceptance of, our products and services is subject to a high level of uncertainty. Adoption of software solutions, particularly by those individuals and enterprises that have historically relied upon traditional means of commerce and communication, requires a broad acceptance of substantially different methods of conducting business and exchanging information. Our products and services are often considered complex and may involve a new approach to the conduct of business by our customers. As a result, intensive marketing and sales efforts may be necessary to educate prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of these products and services in order to generate additional demand. The market for our products and services may weaken, competitors may develop superior products and services or we may fail to develop acceptable solutions to address new market conditions. Any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. We May Not Be Competitive, And Increased Competition Could Seriously Harm Our Business. Relative to us, some of our competitors have one or more of the following advantages:  Longer operating history  Greater financial, technical, marketing, sales and other resources  More consistent positive cash flows  Longer history of profitable operations  Greater name recognition  A broader range of products to offer  Better product functionality and performance in certain areas  A larger installed base of customers Current and potential competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products, which may result in increased competition. In addition, we expect to experience increasing price competition as we compete for market share. We understand that some competitors are offering enterprise application software at no charge as components of product bundles. Further, traditional enterprise resource planning vendors have focused more resources on the development and marketing of enterprise application software, particularly in the product and industry segments in which we compete, and, increasingly, corporate information technology departments are undertaking internal development efforts. As a result of these and other factors, we may be unable to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors. 10 Table of Contents We Have Been And Continue To Be Subject To Product Quality And Performance Claims And Other Litigation, Which Could Seriously Harm Our Business. From time to time, customers make claims pertaining to the quality and performance of our software and services, citing a variety of issues. Whether customer claims regarding the quality and performance of our products and services are founded or unfounded, they may adversely impact customer demand and affect the market perception of our company, our products and our services. Any such damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Our software products generally are used by our customers in mission-critical applications where component failures or software errors could cause significant damages. Although we conduct testing and quality assurance through a release management process, we may not discover errors until our customers install and use a given product or until the volume of services that a product provides increases. Errors could result in loss of customers and reputation, adverse publicity, loss of revenues, delays in market acceptance, diversion of development and consulting resources and claims against us by customers. To mitigate this exposure, our license agreements typically seek to limit our exposure to product liability claims from our customers. However, these contract provisions may not preclude all potential claims. Additionally, our insurance policies may be inadequate to protect us from all liability that we may face. Product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages. As a result, any claim, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. On March 7, 2007, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our current and former officers and directors, naming the company as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment in connection with stock option grants to certain of the defendant officers and directors on three dates in 2004 and 2005. The complaint states that those stock option grants were manipulated so as to work to the recipients favor when material non-public information about the company was later disclosed to positive or negative effect. The complaint is derivative in nature and does not seek relief from the company, but does seek damages and other relief from the defendant officers and directors. We have entered into indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business with certain of the defendant officers and directors and may be obligated throughout the pendency of this action to advance payment of legal fees and costs incurred by the defendants pursuant to our obligations under the indemnification agreements and/or applicable Delaware law. We may face other claims and litigation in the future that could harm our business and impair our liquidity. Defending against existing and potential litigation and other proceedings may continue to require us to spend significant time and money and to pay significant damages. We cannot assure you that the time, effort and financial resources that could be required will not adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. The Loss Of Key Personnel Or Our Failure To Attract Additional Personnel Could Seriously Harm Our Company. We rely upon the continued service of a relatively small number of key technical, sales and senior management personnel. However, our employees can typically resign with little or no previous notice and our voluntary attrition rate is believed to be higher than the software industrys average. Our future success depends on our ability to retain our key employees and to attract, train and retain other highly qualified personnel. Our loss of any of our key employees or our inability to attract, train and retain other highly qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. 11 Table of Contents Because Our Software Products Are Intended To Work Within Complex Business Processes, Implementation Or Upgrades Of Our Products Can Be Difficult, Time-Consuming And Expensive, And Customers May Be Unable To Implement Or Upgrade Our Products Successfully Or Otherwise Achieve The Benefits Attributable To Our Products. This May Result In Customer Dissatisfaction, Harm To Our Reputation And Cause Non-Payment Issues. Our products typically must integrate with the many existing computer systems and software programs of our customers. This can be complex, time-consuming and expensive, and may cause delays in the deployment of our products. As a result, some customers may have difficulty implementing our products successfully or otherwise achieving the benefits attributable to our products. Delayed or ineffective implementation or upgrades of our software and services may limit our future sales opportunities, impact revenues, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation, or cause non-payment issues. Failure To Complete Development Projects As Planned Could Harm Our Operating Results And Create Business Distractions And Negative Publicity That Could Harm Our Business. Risks associated with our software solutions and other development projects include, but are not limited to:  Customers may withhold cash payments or cancel contracts if we fail to meet our delivery commitments, the customers have financial difficulties or change strategy, or the functionality delivered is not acceptable to the customers. We are particularly susceptible to this with respect to arrangements where payments are scheduled to occur later in the engagement.  The cancellation or scaling back of one or more of our larger software solutions or other development projects could have a material adverse impact on future software solutions revenues.  We may be unable to recognize revenue associated with software solutions and other development projects in accordance with expectations. We generally recognize revenue from software solutions and other development projects over time using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting. Failure to complete project phases in accordance with the overall project plan can create variability in our expected revenue streams if we are not able to recognize revenues related to particular projects because of delays in development.  Many of our software solutions and other development projects are fixed-price arrangements. If we fail to accurately estimate the resources required for a fixed-price project or the customer attempts to change the scope of the project, the profit, if any, realized from the project would be adversely affected to the extent that we have to add additional resources to complete the project. If We Fail To Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights Or Face A Claim Of Intellectual Property Infringement By A Third Party, We Could Lose Our Intellectual Property Rights Or Be Liable For Significant Damages. We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. However, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. This is particularly true in India, where a significant portion of our Solutions Operations are located, and other foreign countries such as China and Russia where the laws do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and may not provide us with an effective remedy against piracy. The misappropriation or duplication of our intellectual property could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. In connection with our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, on September 5, 2006 we filed a lawsuit against SAP AG and SAP Americas, Inc. alleging infringement of seven patents related to supply chain management. This and any other litigation to defend our intellectual property rights could be time-consuming and costly. 12 Table of Contents There has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software industry regarding intellectual property rights. As a result, we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement. Although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation or damages, cause product shipment delays or the loss or deferral of sales, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. If we enter into royalty or licensing agreements in settlement of any litigation or claims, these agreements may not be on terms favorable to us. Unfavorable royalty and licensing agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Serious Harm To Our Business Could Result If Our Encryption Technology Fails To Ensure The Security Of Our Customers Online Transactions. The secure exchange of confidential information over public networks is a significant concern of consumers engaging in on-line transactions and interaction. Some of our software applications use encryption technology to provide the security necessary to effect the secure exchange of valuable and confidential information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that these applications use to protect customer transaction data. If any compromise or breach were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. We Are Dependent On Third-Party Software That We Incorporate Into And Include With Our Products And Solutions, And Impaired Relations With These Third Parties, Defects In Third-Party Software Or The Inability To Enhance Their Software Over Time Could Harm Our Business. We incorporate and include third-party software into and with certain of our products and solutions. Additionally, we may incorporate and include additional third-party software into and with our products and solutions in future product offerings. The operation of our products could be impaired if errors occur in the third-party software that we utilize. It may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third-party software because the development and maintenance of the software is not within our control. Accordingly, our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software. There can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to make their software available to us on acceptable terms, to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the software capabilities, or to remain in business. Further, it may be difficult for us to replace any third-party software if a vendor seeks to terminate our license to the software or our ability to license the software to customers. Any impairment in our relationship with these third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. We Face Risks Associated With International Sales And Operations That Could Harm Our Company. International revenues accounted for approximately 43% of our total revenues during 2006, and we expect to continue to generate a significant portion of our revenues from international sales in the future. Our international operations are subject to risks inherent in international business activities, including the tendency of markets outside of the U.S. to be more volatile and difficult to forecast than the U.S. market. Any of the following factors, among other things, could adversely affect the success of our international operations:  Difficulties and costs of staffing and managing geographically disparate operations  Extended accounts receivable collection cycles in certain countries  Compliance with a variety of foreign business practices, laws and regulations  Overlap of different tax structures and regimes, including transfer pricing  Meeting import and export licensing requirements  Trade restrictions 13 Table of Contents  Changes in tariff and tax rates  Changes in general economic and political conditions in international markets In addition, we conduct a large portion of our software solutions development and services operations in India. The distributed nature of our development and consulting resources could create operational challenges and complications since we have a heightened risk exposure to changes in the economic, security and political conditions of India. Operational issues, recruiting and retention issues, ability to obtain work permits, economic and political instability, military actions and other unforeseen occurrences in India could impair our ability to develop and introduce new software applications and functionality in a timely manner, or hinder our ability to provide cost-competitive services, either of which could put our products at a competitive disadvantage and cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers. We May Make Future Acquisitions Or Enter Into Joint Ventures That Are Not Successful, Which Could Seriously Harm Our Business. Historically, we have acquired technology or businesses to supplement and expand our product offerings. In the future, we could acquire additional products, technologies or businesses, or enter into joint venture arrangements, for the purpose of complementing or expanding our business. Negotiation of potential acquisitions or joint ventures and our integration of acquired products, technologies or businesses could divert managements time and resources. Future acquisitions could cause us to issue equity securities that would dilute existing stockholders, incur debt or contingent liabilities, amortize intangible assets, or write off in-process research and development and other acquisition-related expenses that could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. We may not be able to properly integrate acquired products, technologies or businesses with our existing products and operations, train, retain and motivate personnel from the acquired businesses, or combine potentially different corporate cultures. Failure to do so could deprive us of the intended benefits of those acquisitions. In addition, we may be required to write-off acquired research and development if further development of purchased technology becomes unfeasible, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Changes In The Value Of The U.S. Dollar, As Compared To The Currencies Of Foreign Countries Where We Transact Business, Could Harm Our Operating Results. To date, our international revenues have been denominated primarily in U.S. Dollars. However, the majority of our international expenses, including the wages of approximately 62% of our employees, have been denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to these other currencies may adversely affect our operating results. We have implemented limited hedging programs to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations affecting international accounts receivable, cash balances and intercompany accounts, but we do not hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations affecting future international revenues and expenses and other commitments. For the foregoing reasons, currency exchange rate fluctuations have caused, and likely will continue to cause, variability in our foreign currency denominated revenue streams and our cost to settle foreign currency denominated liabilities. We May Not Be Able to Fully Realize The Benefits Of Our Deferred Tax Assets. Our ability to utilize our domestic net operating loss carryforwards during their remaining life is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient domestic taxable income during the carryforward periods. If we do not generate sufficient domestic taxable income, the remaining net operating loss carryforwards may expire without being fully utilized. In addition, pursuant to section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the amount of and benefit from our domestic net operating loss carryforwards, and other tax attributes, may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances. Events which cause limitations on the amount of net operating losses and other tax attributes that we may utilize in the future include, but are not limited to, a cumulative change in ownership of greater than 50% 14 Table of Contents in the value of the company (for those instruments that constitute equity for section 382 purposes), over the lesser of a three-year period ending on a specific testing date or a previous ownership change date. A testing date generally occurs upon the issuance, transfer or repurchase of the company's securities or debt that is treated as a security for purposes of determining an ownership change. A cumulative change in ownership of greater than 50% would limit our ability to fully utilize our domestic net operating loss carryforwards. Failure Or Circumvention Of Our Controls And Procedures Or Failure To Comply With Regulations Related To Controls And Procedures Could Seriously Harm Our Business. Over time, we have made significant changes in and may consider making additional changes to our internal controls, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure of our controls, policies and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Risks Related To Our Industry If Our Products Are Not Able To Deliver Fast, Demonstrable Value To Our Customers, Our Business Could Be Seriously Harmed. Enterprises are requiring their application software vendors to provide faster time to value on their technology investments. We must continue to improve the speed of our implementations and the pace at which our products deliver value or our competitors may gain important strategic advantages over us. If we cannot successfully respond to these market demands, or if our competitors do so more effectively than we do, our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Releases Of And Problems With New Products May Cause Purchasing Delays, Which Would Harm Our Revenues. Our practice and the practice in the industry is to periodically develop and release new products and enhancements. As a result, customers may delay their purchasing decisions in anticipation of our new or enhanced products, or products of competitors. Delays in customer purchasing decisions could seriously harm our business and operating results. Moreover, significant delays in the general availability of new releases, significant problems in the installation or implementation of new releases, or customer dissatisfaction with new releases could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Risks Related To Our Stock Our Stock Price Historically Has Been Volatile, Which May Make It More Difficult To Resell Common Stock At Attractive Prices. The market price of our common stock has been highly volatile in the past, and may continue to be volatile in the future. The following factors could significantly affect the market price of our common stock:  Continued quarterly variations in our results of operations and cash flows  Technological innovations by our competitors or us  Announcement of new customers, new products, product enhancements, joint ventures and other alliances by our competitors or us  Additional equity or debt financing transactions, or the absence thereof  Stock valuations or performance of our competitors  General market conditions, geopolitical events or market conditions specific to particular industries  Perceptions in the marketplace of performance problems involving our products and services 15 Table of Contents The Price Of Our Common Stock May Decline Due To Shares Eligible For Future Sale. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the appearance that a large number of our shares are available for sale, could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. In addition to the adverse effect a price decline could have on holders of common stock, that decline would likely impede our ability to raise capital by issuing additional shares of common stock or other equity securities. Our Executive Officers And Directors, In Particular Sanjiv Sidhu And An Affiliate Of Q Investments, Have Significant Influence Over Stockholder Votes. As of December 31, 2006, our current executive officers and directors together beneficially controlled approximately 22.3% of the total voting power of our company, approximately 21.6% of which was controlled by Sanjiv Sidhu, our current Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer and President, and entities that he controls. Further, an affiliate of Q Investments beneficially controls approximately 17.8% of the voting power of the company, and has the right to appoint two directors to our Board of Directors. Accordingly, Mr. Sidhu, the Q Investments affiliate and our officers and directors holding or controlling holdings of stock in our company have had and will have significant influence in determining the composition of our Board of Directors and other significant matters requiring stockholder approval or acquiescence, including amendments to our certificate of incorporation, a substantial sale of assets, a merger or similar corporate transaction or a non-negotiated takeover attempt. Such concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making an offer to buy our company that other stockholders might find favorable, which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our Charter And Bylaws Have Anti-Takeover Provisions And We Have A Stockholder Rights Plan Which, In Combination, Effectively Inhibit A Non-Negotiated Merger Or Business Combination. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, Delaware law and our stockholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders. The combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a non-negotiated merger or other business combination. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
