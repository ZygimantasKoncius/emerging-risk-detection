ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report, North American Galvanizing cautions current and potential investors that the following risk factors, among others, sometimes have affected, and in the future could affect, the Company's actual results and could cause such results during fiscal 2006, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of North American Galvanizing. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and you may lose all of your investment. GALVANIZING IS A BUSINESS SENSITIVE TO ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR REVENUES TO DECREASE. NAG is principally engaged in hot dip galvanizing of metal products and components fabricated by its customers. All of the Company's revenue is generated from the value-added galvanizing and coating of its customer's products. NAG galvanizes iron and steel products by immersing them in molten zinc. This bonding process produces an alloyed metal surface that provides an effective barrier ("cathodic protection") against oxidation and corrosion from exposure to the elements, for up to 50 years. The galvanizing process provides effective corrosion protection of fabricated steel which is used in numerous markets such as petrochemical, highway and transportation, energy, utilities, communications, irrigation, pulp and paper, waste water treatment, food processing, recreation and the manufacture of original equipment. The demand for these products and, in turn, for our galvanizing, is dependent on the general economy, the industries listed, and other factors affecting domestic goods activity. If there is a reduction in demand, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels, the quantity of galvanizing services provided by us and our revenues. THE VOLATILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIAL AND NATURAL GAS COSTS COULD REDUCE THE COMPANY'S PROFITS. Purchased zinc and natural gas, combined, represent the largest portion of cost of goods sold. NAG's costs in 2005 relating to zinc and natural gas increased dramatically over the prior year. The price and availability of zinc and natural gas that is used in the galvanizing process is highly competitive and cyclical. The following factors, most of which are beyond the Company's control, affect the price of zinc and natural gas: o supply and demand factors; o freight costs and transportation availability; o inventory levels; o trade duties and taxes; and o labor disputes. The Company seeks to maintain its profit margin by attempting to increase the price of its services in response to an increase in costs, but may not be successful in passing these price increases through to its customers. TERMS OF THE COMPANY'S EXISTING BANK TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY RESTRICT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS. These restrictions include specified minimum values for the net worth and working capital and a maximum debt to net worth ratio for the Company, and limitations on incurring additional debt or capital expenditures or engaging in acquisitions and dispositions by the Company. Among the foregoing, the most restrictive covenant is the requirement that the aggregate expenditures for capital expenditures, debt and interest not exceed the aggregate of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). While the Company has maintained continuous compliance with all of the required financial covenants of the credit facility since the first quarter of 2005, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to comply with these restrictions without disrupting its business. 6 NORTH AMERICAN GALVANIZING & COATINGS, INC. IS INVOLVED IN A LAWSUIT CONCERNING A FORMER SUBSIDIARY'S OPERATION OF A STORAGE TERMINAL IN VIOLATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. In 2004, attorneys for the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (the "Water District") filed a complaint in District Court, naming North American Galvanizing & Coatings, Inc. as an added defendant. This Complaint seeks enforcement of an August 12, 2004 default judgment in the amount of $1,810,463.34 against a former subsidiary of the Company, Lake River Corporation and Lake River Holding Company, Inc. The default judgment is in connection with the operation of a storage terminal by Lake River Corporation in violation of environmental laws. The Complaint asserts that prior to the sale of Lake River Corporation, North American Galvanizing directly operated the Lake River facility. The Water District seeks to have the Court pierce the corporate veil of Lake River Corporation and enforce the default judgment order of August 12, 2004 against the Company. In December 2004, the Water District filed another complaint in the litigation, adding two claims: (1) a common law claim for nuisance; and (2) a claim under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In this claim, the Water District argues that the Company is responsible for conditions on the plaintiff's property that present an "imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and the environment. At this time, the Company has incurred a significant amount of legal costs to defend this case and has not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter. Such a liability, if any, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. THE ADDITION OF HOT-DIP GALVANIZING CAPACITY COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR GALVANIZING SERVICES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUES. Galvanizing is a highly competitive business with relatively low barriers to entry. NAG competes with other galvanizing companies, captive galvanizing facilities operated by manufacturers and alternate forms of corrosion protection such as paint. Excessive capacity in hot-dip galvanizing could have a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of galvanized services provided by the Company. THE COMPANY MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT MANAGEMENT RESOURCES IF THERE IS TURNOVER IN KEY PERSONNEL. Providing a competitive service acceptable in quality and price requires a management team that is technically skilled in providing galvanizing services. In past years, the Company has downsized administrative and management positions as a result of cost-cutting initiatives. Lack of management resources could impact the Company's ability to operate and compete in the galvanizing industry. FAILURE TO RENEW OR REACH ACCEPTABLE NEW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS COULD RESULT IN LABOR DISRUPTIONS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND REVENUES. The Company is subject to two collective bargaining agreements. NAG's labor agreement with the United Steel Workers Union covering production workers at its Tulsa galvanizing plants expired March 31, 2003. In October 2003, the union employees ratified a new three-year labor agreement, effective November 1, 2003. The United Steel Workers Union represents the labor force at the galvanizing business purchased in Canton, Ohio in February 2005. At the time of purchase, NAGalv-Ohio, Inc. did not assume the existing labor agreement and implemented wage and benefit programs similar to those at the Company's other galvanizing facilities. The Company is currently in negotiation with the union on a new contract. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be successful in securing a new labor agreement. If a new agreement is negotiated, there can be no guarantee that the new agreement will be at satisfactory terms with regard to the efficiency and productivity of the work force. Collective bargaining agreements with our employees generally cover wages, health care benefits and retirement plans, seniority, job classes and work rules. Failure to renew these agreements upon expiration or to establish new collective bargaining agreements on terms acceptable to us could result in work stoppages or other labor disruptions which could adversely impact our customer relationships, financial condition and results of operations. 7 VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS APPLICABLE TO THE GALVANIZING BUSINESS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTIONS WHICH WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The Company's business is subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations with respect to air emissions, storm water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. Although NAG believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and the presently unpredictable ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements could affect operations. The Company may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE IMPACTED BY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR BY A LACK OF POTENTIAL ACQUISITION CANDIDATES. From time to time, the Company evaluates potential acquisition opportunities to support and strengthen its business. NAG may not be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates, acquire candidates on acceptable terms or integrate acquired businesses successfully. In addition, NAG may be required to incur additional debt and contingent liabilities, or to issue shares of its common stock in order to consummate future acquisitions. Such issuances might have a dilutive effect on current equity holders. DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. The process of integrating acquired businesses effectively involves the following risks: o assimilating operations and products may be unexpectedly difficult; o management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns; o the Company may enter markets in which it has limited or no direct experience; and o the Company may lose key employees of an acquired business. THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHOSE INTERESTS MAY NOT BE ALIGNED WITH OTHER SHAREHOLDERS, WILL BE ABLE TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF SHAREHOLDER VOTES. As of December 31, 2005, the Company's board of directors collectively owned approximately 35.2% of the Company's common stock. Accordingly, the directors, as a group, will be able to significantly influence the outcome of shareholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in NAG's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions, and their interests may not be aligned with other shareholders. The existence of these levels of ownership concentrated in a few persons makes it less likely that any other holder of common stock will be able to affect the Company's management or direction. These factors may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in management or voting control or the Company's acquisition by a third party. ITEM 1B.
