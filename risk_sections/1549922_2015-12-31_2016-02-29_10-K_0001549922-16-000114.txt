Item 1A. Risk Factors is divided into the following sections: •Risks Related to our Business•Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us•Tax RisksRisks Related to our BusinessOur principal business strategy is to increase the amount of cash distribution we make to our unitholders over time. We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including cost reimbursements of expenses incurred on our behalf by our general partner, to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly distribution ("MQD") or any distribution to holders of our common units.To pay the MQD of $0.40 per unit per quarter, or $1.60 per unit on an annualized basis, we will require available cash of $27.1 million per quarter, or $108.5 million per year (based on units outstanding, as of December 31, 2015). We may not have sufficient available cash from operating surplus each quarter to pay the MQD. The amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the volumes we gather, treat and process; •the level of production of natural gas and crude oil (and associated volumes of produced water) from wells connected to our gathering systems, which is dependent in part on the demand for, and the market prices of, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs;•damage to pipelines, facilities, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by earthquakes, floods, fires, severe weather, explosions and other natural disasters, accidents and acts of terrorism;•leaks or accidental releases of hazardous materials into the environment;•weather conditions and seasonal trends;•changes in the fees we charge for our services;•the level of competition from other midstream energy companies in our areas of operation;•changes in the level of our operating, maintenance and general and administrative expenses;•regulatory action affecting the supply of, or demand for, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, the fees we can charge, how we contract for services, our existing contracts, our operating and maintenance costs or our operating flexibility; and •prevailing economic and market conditions. In addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:•the level and timing of capital expenditures we make;•the level of our operating, maintenance and general and administrative expenses, including reimbursements of expenses incurred on our behalf by our general partner;•the cost of acquisitions, if any;Table of Contents•our debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in our working capital needs;•our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in our debt agreements;•the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner; •not receiving anticipated shortfall payments from our customers; and•other business risks affecting our cash levels. We depend on certain customers for a significant portion of our revenues. The loss of, or material nonpayment or nonperformance by, or the curtailment of production by, any one or more of these customers could materially adversely affect our revenues, cash flow and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.Certain of our customers may have material financial and liquidity issues or may, as a result of operational incidents or other events, be disproportionately affected as compared to larger, better-capitalized companies. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flows and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. We expect our exposure to concentrated risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue as long as we remain substantially dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue.If our customers curtail or reduce production in our areas of operation, it could reduce throughput on our system and, therefore, materially adversely affect our revenues, cash flow and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.We are exposed to the creditworthiness and performance of our customers, suppliers and contract counterparties, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by one or more of these parties could materially adversely affect our financial and operating results.Although we attempt to assess the creditworthiness and associated liquidity of our customers, suppliers and contract counterparties, there can be no assurance that our assessments will be accurate or that there will not be a rapid or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, which may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. In addition, there can be no assurance that our contract counterparties will perform or adhere to existing or future contractual arrangements, including making any required shortfall payments.The policies and procedures we use to manage our exposure to credit risk, such as credit analysis, credit monitoring and, if necessary, requiring credit support, cannot fully eliminate counterparty credit risks. To the extent our policies and procedures prove to be inadequate, our financial and operational results may be negatively impacted.Some of our counterparties may be highly leveraged, have limited financial resources and/or have recently experienced a rating agency downgrade and will be subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. Even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, we may experience financial losses in our dealings with such parties. In addition, volatility in commodity prices could have a negative impact on our counterparties, which, in turn, could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us.Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our counterparties or suppliers could require us to pursue substitute counterparties or suppliers for the affected operations or reduce our operations. There can be no assurance that any such efforts would be successful or would provide similar financial and operational results.Adverse developments in our areas of operation could materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and reduce our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.Our operations are focused on gathering, treating and processing services in four unconventional resource basins: (i) the Appalachian Basin, which includes the Marcellus Shale formation in northern West Virginia; (ii) the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations in northwestern North Dakota; (iii) the Fort Worth Basin, which includes the Barnett Shale formation in north-central Texas; and (iv) the Piceance Basin, which includes the Mesaverde formation and the Mancos and Niobrara shale formations in western Colorado and eastern Utah. Due to our limited industry and geographic diversity, adverse developments in the natural gas and crude oil 18Table of Contentsindustries or in our existing areas of operation could have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Significant prolonged weakness in natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices could reduce throughput on our systems and materially adversely affect our revenues and cash available to make cash distributions to our unitholders over the long term.The current level of natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices has had a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity in our areas of operation. Unchanged or lower natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices over the long term could result in a further decline in the production of natural gas and crude oil, thereby resulting in reduced throughput on our gathering systems. The price of natural gas has been at historically low levels for an extended period of time. In addition, the price of crude oil has experienced a significant decline since the fall of 2014 in response to a global supply surplus.Additionally, due to the extended period of historically low natural gas prices and decline in NGL and crude oil prices, certain of our customers in each of our areas of operations have, and others could, reduce drilling activity and capital expenditure budgets. If natural gas, NGL and/or crude oil prices remain depressed or decrease further, it could cause sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in our areas of operation and result in a further reduction in throughput on our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.Because of the natural decline in production from existing wells in our areas of operation, our success depends in part on our customers replacing declining production and also on our ability to maintain levels of throughput on our systems. Any decrease in the volumes that we gather and process could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.The customer volumes that support our business depend on the level of production from natural gas and crude oil wells connected to our systems, the production from which may be less than expected and will naturally decline over time. As a result, our cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time. To maintain or increase throughput levels on our systems, we must obtain new sources of volume throughput. The primary factors affecting our ability to obtain new sources of volume throughput include (i) the level of successful drilling activity in our areas of operation and (ii) our ability to compete for new volumes on our systems.We have no control over the level of drilling activity in our areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to our systems or the rate at which production from a well declines. In addition, we have no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions, which are affected by, among other things:•the availability and cost of capital;•prevailing and projected commodity prices, including the prices of crude oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbon products, including NGLs;•demand for crude oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbon products, including NGLs;•levels of reserves;•geological considerations;•environmental or other governmental regulations, including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing; and•the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment. Fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new crude oil and natural gas reserves. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease. In general terms, the prices of crude oil, natural gas, and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:•worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions; •weather conditions and seasonal trends; •the levels of domestic production and consumer demand; •the availability of imported liquefied natural gas ("LNG"); •the ability to export LNG; 19Table of Contents•the availability of transportation systems with adequate capacity; •the volatility and uncertainty of regional pricing differentials and premiums; •the price and availability of alternative fuels; •the effect of energy conservation measures; •the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation; and •the anticipated future prices of crude oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbon products, including NGLs. Because of these factors, even if new crude oil or natural gas reserves are known to exist in areas served by our assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. If reductions in drilling activity result in our inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on our systems, those reductions could reduce our revenue and cash flow and materially adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.In addition, it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on our gathering systems, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which we operate generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. Should we determine that the economics of our gathering, treating and processing assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, revenues associated with these assets will decline over time. In addition to capital expenditures to support growth, the steeper production decline curves associated with unconventional resource plays may require us to incur higher maintenance capital expenditures over time, which will reduce our cash available for distribution.Many of our costs are fixed and do not vary with our throughput. These costs may not decline ratably or at all should we experience a reduction in throughput, which could result in a decline in our revenue and cash flow and materially adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.If our customers do not increase the volumes they provide to our gathering systems, our growth strategy and ability to increase cash distributions to our unitholders may be materially adversely affected.If we are unsuccessful in attracting new customers and/or new gathering opportunities with existing customers, our ability to increase the throughput on our gathering systems will be dependent on receiving increased volumes from our existing customers. Our customers are not obligated to provide additional volumes to our gathering systems, and they may determine in the future that drilling activities in areas outside of our current areas of operation are strategically more attractive to them. Reductions by our customers in our areas of mutual interest could result in reductions in throughput on our systems and materially adversely impact our ability to grow our operations and increase cash distributions to our unitholders.Certain of our gathering and processing agreements contain provisions that can reduce the cash flow stability that the agreements were designed to achieve.Our gathering and processing agreements were designed to generate stable cash flows for us over the life of the MVC contract term while also minimizing direct commodity price risk. Under certain of these MVCs, our customers agree to ship a minimum volume on our gathering systems or send a minimum volume to our processing plants or, in some cases, to pay a minimum monetary amount, over certain periods during the term of the MVC. In addition, the majority of our gathering and processing agreements also include an aggregate MVC, which is a total amount that the customer must flow on our gathering system or send to our processing plants (or an equivalent monetary amount) over the MVC term. If a customer's actual throughput volumes are less than its minimum volume commitment for the contracted measurement period, it must make a shortfall payment to us at the end of that contract month, quarter or year, as applicable. The amount of the shortfall payment is based on the difference between the actual throughput volume shipped or processed for the applicable period and the MVC for the applicable period, multiplied by the applicable fee. To the extent that a customer's actual throughput volumes are above or below its MVC for the applicable contracted measurement period, many of our gathering agreements contain provisions that allow the customer to use the excess volumes or the shortfall payment to credit against future excess volumes or future shortfall payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.20Table of ContentsWe do not intend to obtain independent evaluations of the reserves connected to our gathering systems on a regular or ongoing basis; therefore, in the future, customer volumes on our systems could be less than we anticipate.We have not obtained and do not intend to obtain independent evaluations of all of the reserves connected to our systems. Moreover, even if we did obtain independent evaluations of all of the reserves connected to our systems, such evaluations may prove to be incorrect. Crude oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices, future production levels and operating and development costs.Accordingly, we may not have accurate estimates of total reserves dedicated to some or all of our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves connected to our gathering systems are less than we anticipate and we are unable to secure additional volumes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.Our industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.We compete with other midstream companies, in our areas of operations, some of which are large companies that have greater financial, managerial and other resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have assets in closer proximity to natural gas and crude oil supplies and may have available idle capacity in existing assets that would not require new capital investments for use. Our competitors may expand or construct gathering systems that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. Because our customers do not have leases that cover the entirety of our areas of mutual interest, non-customer producers that lease acreage within any of our areas of mutual interest may choose to use one of our competitors for their gathering and/or processing service needs.In addition, our customers may develop their own gathering systems outside of our areas of mutual interest. Our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.We may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis.Our gathering, treating and processing contracts have terms of various durations. As these contracts expire, we may have to negotiate extensions or renewals with existing customers or enter into new contracts with other customers. We may be unable to obtain new contracts on favorable commercial terms, if at all. We also may be unable to maintain the economic structure of a particular contract with an existing customer or the overall mix of our contract portfolio. Moreover, we may be unable to obtain areas of mutual interest from new customers in the future, and we may be unable to renew existing areas of mutual interest with current customers as and when they expire. The extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including:•the level of existing and new competition to provide gathering and/or processing services in our areas of operation;•the macroeconomic factors affecting gathering, treating and processing economics for our current and potential customers;•the balance of supply and demand, on a short-term, seasonal and long-term basis, in our markets;•the extent to which the customers in our areas of operation are willing to contract on a long-term basis; and•the effects of federal, state or local regulations on the contracting practices of our customers. To the extent we are unable to renew our existing contracts on terms that are favorable to us or successfully manage our overall contract mix over time, our revenues and cash flows could decline and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected.If third-party pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to our gathering systems become partially or fully unavailable, our revenue and cash flow and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected.Our gathering systems connect to third-party pipelines and other midstream facilities, such as processing plants, rail terminals and produced water disposal facilities. The continuing operation of such third-party pipelines and other 21Table of Contentsmidstream facilities is not within our control. These pipelines and other midstream facilities may become unavailable due to issues including, but not limited to, testing, turnarounds, line repair, reduced operating pressure, lack of operating capacity, regulatory requirements, curtailments of receipt or deliveries due to insufficient capacity or because of damage from other operational hazards. In addition, we do not have interconnect agreements with all of these pipelines and other facilities and the agreements we do have may be terminated in certain circumstances and/or on short notice. If any of these pipelines or other midstream facilities become unavailable for any reason, or, if these third parties are otherwise unwilling to receive or transport the natural gas, crude oil and produced water that we gather and/or process, our revenue, cash flow and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected.We have a limited ownership history with respect to all of our assets. There could be unknown events or conditions or increased maintenance or repair expenses and downtime associated with our pipelines that could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.We have a relatively limited history of operating our assets. There may be historical occurrences or latent issues regarding our pipeline systems of which we may be unaware and that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The steeper production decline curves associated with unconventional resource plays may require us to incur higher maintenance capital expenditures over time to connect additional wells and maintain throughput volume. Any significant increase in maintenance and repair expenditures or loss of revenue due to the condition of our pipeline systems could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.Crude oil and natural gas production in certain areas in which we operate may be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions which in turn could negatively impact the operations of our gathering, treating and processing facilities and our construction of additional facilities.Extended periods of below freezing weather and unseasonably wet weather conditions, especially in North Dakota and West Virginia, can be severe and can adversely affect crude oil and natural gas operations due to the potential shut-in of producing wells or decreased drilling activities. The result of these types of interruptions could result in a decrease in the volumes supplied to our gathering systems. Further, delays and shutdowns caused by severe weather during the winter months may have a material negative impact on the continuous operations of our gathering, treating and processing systems, including interruptions in service. These types of interruptions could negatively impact our ability to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and thereby give rise to certain termination rights and/or the release of dedicated acreage. Any resulting terminations or releases could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.Interruptions in operations at any of our facilities may adversely affect our operations and cash flows available for distribution to our unitholders.Our operations depend upon the infrastructure that we have developed and constructed. Any significant interruption at any of our gathering, treating or processing facilities, or in our ability to provide gathering, treating or processing services, could adversely affect our operations and cash flows available for distribution to our unitholders.Operations at our facilities could be partially or completely shut down, temporarily or permanently, as the result of circumstances not within our control, such as:•unscheduled turnarounds or catastrophic events at our physical plants or pipeline facilities;•restrictions imposed by governmental authorities or court proceedings;•labor difficulties that result in a work stoppage or slowdown;•a disruption in the supply of resources necessary to operate our midstream facilities;•damage to our facilities resulting from production volumes that do not comply with applicable specifications; and•inadequate transportation or market access to support production volumes, including lack of pipeline, rail terminals, produced water disposal facilities and/or third-party processing capacity. 22Table of ContentsOur business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. If a significant incident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured or if we fail to recover all anticipated insurance proceeds for significant incidents or events for which we are insured, our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected.Our operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the operation of gathering, treating and processing systems, including:•damage to pipelines, processing plants, compression assets, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism;•inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, farm and utility equipment;•leaks or losses resulting from the malfunction of equipment or facilities; •ruptures, fires and explosions; and•other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. The location of certain of our systems in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the damages resulting from these risks.These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of our operations. A natural disaster or any event such as those described above affecting the areas in which we and our customers operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers. Such circumstances, including those arising from maintenance and repair activities, could result in service interruptions on portions or all of our gathering systems. Potential customer impacts arising from service interruptions on segments of our gathering systems could include limitations on our ability to satisfy customer requirements, obligations to temporarily waive minimum volume commitments during times of constrained capacity, and solicitation of existing customers by others for potential new projects that would compete directly with our existing services. Such circumstances could materially adversely impact our ability to meet contractual obligations and retain customers, with a resulting negative impact on our business and results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.Our insurance coverage is provided by policies that cover all of our assets and those of Summit Investments and its non-SMLP subsidiaries. Therefore, it is possible that an incident, or incidents, at those subsidiaries could exhaust claim capacity and leave SMLP and its subsidiaries exposed to risk of loss should they experience a loss during the same policy cycle. In addition, although we have a range of insurance programs providing varying levels of protection for public liability, damage to property, loss of income and certain environmental hazards, we may not be insured against all causes of loss, claims or damage that may occur. If a significant incident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured, it could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates and/or claims by Summit Investments or its non-SMLP subsidiaries may increase rates on all of the insured-asset group, including those owned by SMLP and its subsidiaries. As a result of industry or market conditions, some of which are beyond our control, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Additionally, with regard to the assets we have acquired, we have limited indemnification rights to recover in the event of any potential environmental liabilities.We intend to grow our business in part by seeking strategic acquisition opportunities. If we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms from third parties, our future growth will be affected, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash generated from operations. Our ability to grow depends, in part, on our ability to make acquisitions that increase our cash generated from operations. The acquisition component of our strategy also relies, in part, on the continued divestiture of midstream assets by industry participants. A material decrease in such divestitures would limit our opportunities for future acquisitions and could materially adversely affect our ability to grow our operations and increase our cash distributions to our unitholders.If we are unable to make accretive acquisitions from third parties, whether because we are (i) unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts; (ii) unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms; (iii) outbid by competitors; or (iv) unable to obtain necessary 23Table of Contentsgovernmental or third-party consents or for any other reason, then our future growth and ability to increase cash distributions on a per-unit basis will be limited. If we are unable to acquire assets from third parties in the near or long term it may adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in the cash generated from operations. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:•mistaken assumptions about volumes, revenue and costs, including synergies and potential growth;•an inability to secure adequate customer commitments to use the acquired systems or facilities;•the risk that natural gas or crude oil reserves expected to support the acquired assets may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;•an inability to successfully integrate the assets or businesses we acquire;•coordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities;•the assumption of unknown liabilities for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;•mistaken assumptions about the overall costs of debt or equity capital;•the diversion of management's and employees' attention from other business concerns;•unforeseen difficulties operating in new geographic areas and business lines;•customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses;•production declines higher than anticipated; and •facilities being properly constructed.If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization, results of operations and future growth may change significantly and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in deciding to engage in these future acquisitions, which may reduce, rather than increase, our cash generated from operations.Following the initial closing of the 2016 Drop Down, which is expected to occur in March 2016, substantially all of the assets owned by Summit Investments will be contributed to the Partnership, and, as a result, our growth strategy will become more dependent on making acquisitions from third parties. This shift from a growth strategy focused, primarily, on acquisitions from Summit Investments, to one focused, primarily, on third-party acquisitions could materially adversely affect our ability to grow our operations and increase our cash distributions to our unitholders.We may fail to successfully integrate gathering system acquisitions into our existing business in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders, or fail to realize all of the expected benefits of the acquisitions, which could negatively impact our future results of operations.Integration of future gathering system acquisitions could be a complex, time-consuming and costly process, particularly if the acquired assets significantly increase our size and/or diversify the geographic areas in which we operate or the service offerings that we provide.The failure to successfully integrate the acquired assets with our existing business in a timely manner may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. If any of the risks described above or in the immediately preceding risk factor or unanticipated liabilities or costs were to materialize with respect to future acquisitions or if the acquired assets were to perform at levels below the forecasts we used to evaluate them, then the anticipated benefits from the acquisition may not be fully realized, if at all, and our future results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders could be negatively impacted.Our construction of new assets may not result in revenue increases and will be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.One of the ways we intend to grow our business is through organic growth projects. The construction of additions or modifications to our existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic uncertainties that are beyond our control.24Table of ContentsSuch expansion projects may also require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, and financing, traditional or otherwise, may not be available on economically acceptable terms or at all. If we undertake these projects, our revenue may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds for a particular project and they may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost, or at all. Moreover, we could construct facilities to capture anticipated future production growth in a region where such growth does not materialize or only materializes over a period materially longer than expected. To the extent we rely on estimates of future production in our decision to construct additions to our systems, such estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to the numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of future production. As a result, new facilities may not attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the construction of additions or modifications to our existing gathering, treating and processing assets and the construction of new midstream assets may require us to obtain new rights-of-way or federal and state environmental or other authorizations. The approval process for gathering, treating and processing activities has become increasingly challenging, due in part to state and local concerns related to unregulated exploration and production and gathering, treating and processing activities in new production areas. Such authorization may not be granted or, if granted, such authorization may include burdensome or expensive conditions. As a result, we may be unable to obtain such rights-of-way or other authorizations and may, therefore, be unable to connect new volumes to our systems or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive for us to obtain new rights-of-way or authorizations or to renew existing rights-of-way or authorizations. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way or authorizations increases materially, our cash flows could be materially adversely affected.We require access to significant amounts of additional capital to implement our growth strategy, as well as to meet potential future capital requirements under certain of our gathering and processing agreements. Limited access and/or availability of the debt and equity capital markets could impair our ability to grow or cause us to be unable to meet future capital requirements.To expand our asset base, whether through acquisitions or organic growth, we will need to make expansion capital expenditures. We also frequently consider and enter into discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions. In addition, the terms of certain of our gathering and processing agreements also require us to spend significant amounts of capital, over a short period of time, to construct and develop additional midstream assets to support our customers' development projects. Depending on our customers' future development plans, it is possible that the capital we would be required to spend to construct and develop such assets could exceed our ability to finance those expenditures using our cash reserves or available capacity under our amended and restated revolving credit facility.We plan to use cash from operations, incur borrowings, and/or sell additional common units or other securities to fund our future expansion capital expenditures. Using cash from operations to fund expansion capital expenditures will directly reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders. Our ability to obtain financing or to access the capital markets for future debt or equity offerings may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering as well as covenants in our debt agreements, general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. If we are unable to raise expansion capital, we may lose the opportunity to make acquisitions or to gather, treat and process new production volumes from our customers with whom we have agreed to construct and develop midstream assets in the future. Even if we are successful in obtaining funds for expansion capital expenditures through equity or debt financings, the terms thereof could limit our ability to pay distributions to our common unitholders. In addition, incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing additional units representing limited partner interests may result in significant common unitholder dilution and increase the aggregate amount of cash required to maintain the then-current distribution rate, which could materially decrease our ability to pay distributions at the then-current distribution rate.We do not have a contractual commitment from our Sponsor or Summit Investments to provide any direct or indirect financial assistance to us.Because our common units are yield-oriented securities, increases in interest rates could materially adversely impact our unit price, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.Interest rates are generally at or near historic lows and may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on our future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase. 25Table of ContentsAs with other yield-oriented securities, our unit price is impacted by the level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our common units, and a rising interest rate environment could have a material adverse impact on our unit price, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make cash distributions at our intended levels.Debt we incur in the future may limit our flexibility to obtain financing and to pursue other business opportunities.At December 31, 2015, we had $944.0 million of total indebtedness and the unused portion of our $700.0 million amended and restated revolving credit facility totaled $356.0 million. Contingent upon and concurrent with the Initial Close of the 2016 Drop Down, the borrowing capacity of our amended and restated revolving credit facility will increase to $1.25 billion and we will draw $360.0 million to fund the Initial Payment. Our future level of debt could have significant consequences, including among other things:•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes and/or obtaining such financing on favorable terms;•reducing our funds available for operations, future business opportunities and cash distributions to unitholders by that portion of our cash flow required to make interest payments on our debt;•increasing our vulnerability to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and•limiting our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. Our ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service any future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.Restrictions in our amended and restated revolving credit facility and senior notes indentures could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make cash distributions to unitholders and value of our common units.We are dependent upon the earnings and cash flow generated by our operations to meet our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our unitholders. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our amended and restated revolving credit facility, our senior notes indentures and any future financing agreements could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities, which may, in turn, limit our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. For example, our amended and restated revolving credit facility and indentures restrict our ability to, among other things:•incur or guarantee certain additional debt;•make certain cash distributions on or redeem or repurchase certain units;•make certain investments and acquisitions;•make certain capital expenditures;•incur certain liens or permit them to exist;•enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;•merge or consolidate with another company or otherwise engage in a change of control transaction; and•transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets. Our amended and restated revolving credit facility and senior notes indentures also contain covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios and meet certain tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot guarantee that we will meet those ratios and tests.The provisions of our amended and restated revolving credit facility and senior notes indentures may affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities as well as affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of 26Table of Contentsour amended and restated revolving credit facility or senior notes indentures could result in a default or an event of default that could enable our lenders or senior noteholders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay the accelerated amounts, the lenders under our amended and restated revolving credit facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such debt. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and our unitholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. The amended and restated revolving credit facility also has cross default provisions that apply to any other indebtedness we may have and the indentures have cross default provisions that apply to certain other indebtedness.A portion of our revenues are directly exposed to changes in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices, and our exposure may increase in the future.We generate a substantial majority of our revenues pursuant to primarily long-term and fee-based gathering and processing agreements under which we are paid based on the volumes that we gather and/or process rather than the value of the underlying commodity or related byproduct. Consequently, our existing operations and cash flows have limited direct exposure to commodity price risk. Although we will seek to enter into similar fee-based contracts with new customers in the future, our efforts to obtain such contractual terms may not be successful or the local market for our services may not support fee-based gathering and processing agreements. For example, we have percent-of-proceeds contracts with certain natural gas producer customers and we may, in the future, enter into additional percent-of-proceeds contracts with these customers or other customers, which would increase our exposure to commodity price risk, as the revenues generated from those contracts directly correlate with the fluctuating price of the underlying commodities. Substantially all of our remaining revenue is derived from (i) the sale of physical natural gas that we retain from our DFW Midstream customers to offset our power expense associated with our electric-drive compression, (ii) the sale of condensate volumes that we retain at Grand River, and (iii) the sale of processed natural gas and NGLs pursuant to our percent-of-proceeds contracts with certain of our customers on the Bison Midstream and Grand River systems. The revenues we earn from the sale of retained natural gas are tied to the price of natural gas. In addition, changes in the price of crude oil could directly affect the revenues we receive from the sale of condensate and other NGLs. Furthermore, we may acquire or develop additional midstream assets in the future that have a greater exposure to fluctuations in commodity price risk than our current operations. Future exposure to the volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.A change in laws and regulations applicable to our assets or services, or the interpretation or implementation of existing laws and regulations may cause our revenues to decline or our operation and maintenance expenses to increase.Various aspects of our operations are subject to regulation by the various federal, state and local departments and agencies that have jurisdiction over participants in the energy industry. The regulation of our activities and the natural gas and crude oil industries frequently change as they are reviewed by legislators and regulators. In 2014, the North Dakota Industrial Commission began to oversee the integrity and location of underground gathering pipelines that are not monitored by other state or federal agencies and is considering additional rule changes that could result in additional construction and monitoring requirements for all pipelines, including, but not limited to, those that transport produced water. In 2015, the DOT, through PHMSA, proposed changes to its hazardous liquid pipeline regulations that would extend pipeline safety regulation to previously unregulated gathering systems and increase safety requirements for other pipelines as well. Penalties for violating federal safety standards have recently increased. In addition, the adoption of proposals for more stringent legislation, regulation or taxation of drilling activity could directly curtail such activity or increase the cost of drilling, resulting in reduced levels of drilling activity and therefore reduced demand for our services. Regulatory agencies establish and, from time to time, change priorities, which may result in additional burdens on us, such as additional reporting requirements and more frequent audits of operations. Our operations and the markets in which we participate are affected by these laws, regulations and interpretations and may be affected by changes to them or their implementation, which may cause us to realize materially lower revenues or incur materially increased operation and maintenance costs or both.Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in customer production, which could materially adversely impact our revenues.Hydraulic fracturing is an important and increasingly common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations, and is primarily regulated by state agencies. However, Congress has in the past and may in the future consider legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing by federal 27Table of Contentsagencies. Many states have already adopted laws and/or regulations that require disclosure of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, and are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on crude oil and/or natural gas drilling activities. The Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is also moving forward with various related regulatory actions, including approving, on April 17, 2012, new regulations requiring, among other matters, green completions of hydraulically-fractured wells. The requirement to conduct green completions, and the corresponding notification and reporting requirements, went into effect in 2015. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to such drilling activities or to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted, this could result in a reduction in the supply of natural gas and/or crude oil, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to federal anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, potentially other federal regulatory requirements, and state and local regulation, and could be materially affected by changes in such laws and regulations, or in the way they are interpreted and enforced.We believe that our natural gas pipeline facilities qualify as gathering facilities that are exempt from the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), the Natural Gas Act ("NGA") and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the "NGPA"). As of December 31, 2015, movements of crude oil on our crude oil pipelines were not subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”); however, on February 1, 2016, Polar Midstream's FERC tariff for interstate movements of crude oil on its Little Muddy pipeline in North Dakota will become effective (the "Little Muddy Tariff"). The Little Muddy Tariff will be subject to FERC jurisdiction and oversight. We are also generally subject to the anti-market manipulation provisions in the NGA, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and to FERC's regulations thereunder, which authorize FERC to impose fines of up to $1,000,000 per day per violation of the NGA or its implementing regulations. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission holds statutory authority under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to prevent market manipulation in oil markets, and has adopted broad rules and regulations prohibiting fraud and market manipulation. The Federal Trade Commission is also authorized to seek fines of up to $1,000,000 per violation. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC") is directed under the Commodity Exchange Act, to prevent price manipulation in the commodity, futures and swaps markets, including the energy markets. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), and other authority, the CFTC has adopted additional anti-market manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity, futures and swaps markets. The CFTC also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of $1,000,000 per violation or triple the monetary gain to the violator for each violation of the anti-market manipulation provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act.The distinction between federally unregulated natural gas and crude oil pipelines and FERC-regulated natural gas and crude oil pipelines has been the subject of extensive litigation and is determined by FERC on a case-by-case basis. FERC has made no determinations as to the status of our facilities. Consequently, the classification and regulation of some of our pipelines could change based on future determinations by FERC, Congress or the courts. If our natural gas gathering operations or crude oil operations beyond the Little Muddy pipeline become subject to FERC jurisdiction under the NGA, the NGPA or the ICA, the result may materially adversely affect the rates we are able to charge and the services we currently provide, and may include the potential for a termination of our gathering agreements with our customers. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA, the NGPA or the ICA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such services in excess of the rate established by FERC.We are subject to state and local regulation regarding the construction and operation of our gathering, treating and processing systems, as well as state ratable take statutes and regulations. Regulation of the construction and operation of our facilities may affect our ability to expand our facilities or build new facilities and such regulation may cause us to incur additional operating costs or limit the quantities of natural gas and crude oil we may gather, treat and process. Ratable take statutes and regulations generally require gatherers to take natural gas and crude oil production that may be tendered for gathering without undue discrimination. These requirements restrict our right to decide whose production we gather, treat and process. Many states have adopted complaint-based regulation of gathering, treating and processing activities, which allows producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve access issues, rate grievances, and other matters. Other state and municipal regulations do not directly apply to our business, but may nonetheless affect the availability of natural gas and crude oil for gathering, treating and processing, including state regulation of production rates, maximum daily production allowable from wells, and other activities related to drilling and operating wells. While our facilities currently are subject to limited state and local regulation, there is a risk that state or local laws will be changed or reinterpreted, which may materially affect our operations, operating costs, and revenues.28Table of ContentsWe are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.Our gathering, treating and processing operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection, including, for example, the Clean Air Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Clean Water Act; the Oil Pollution Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Endangered Species Act; and the Toxic Substances Control Act.These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the incurrence of capital or operating expenditures to limit or prevent releases of materials from our pipelines and facilities, and the imposition of substantial liabilities and remedial obligations for pollution resulting from our operations or at locations currently or previously owned or operated by us. For example in October 2015, the EPA lowered the existing national ambient air quality standard ("NAAQS") for ozone, which could subject us to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emissions controls, emission offset requirements and increased permitting delays and costs. And in August 2015, the EPA proposed additional regulations to reduce emissions of methane and VOCs from the crude oil and natural gas sector. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly corrective actions or costly pollution control measures. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and requisite permits may result in the assessment of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience a delay in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits or regulatory authorizations, which may cause us to lose potential and current customers, interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.There is a risk that we may incur significant environmental costs and liabilities in connection with our operations due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices, our handling of hydrocarbons and other wastes and potential emissions and discharges related to our operations. Joint and several, strict liability may be incurred, without regard to fault, under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of hydrocarbon wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities, many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years, oftentimes by third parties not under our control. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which our gathering systems pass, and on which certain of our facilities are located, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. For example, an accidental release from one of our pipelines could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. In addition, changes in environmental laws occur frequently, and any such changes that result in additional permitting obligations or more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position. We may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance.We may incur greater than anticipated costs and liabilities as a result of pipeline safety requirements.The DOT, through PHMSA, has adopted and enforces safety standards and procedures applicable to our pipelines. In addition, many states, including the states in which we operate, have adopted regulations that are identical to or more restrictive than existing DOT regulations for intrastate pipelines. Among the regulations applicable to us, PHMSA requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for certain pipelines located in high consequence areas, which include high population areas such as the Dallas-Fort Worth greater metropolitan area where our DFW Midstream system is located. While the majority of our pipelines meet the DOT definition of gathering lines and are thus currently exempt from PHMSA's integrity management requirements, we also operate a limited number of pipelines that are subject to the integrity management requirements. The regulations require operators, including us, to:•perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;•identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;•maintain processes for data collection, integration and analysis;29Table of Contents•repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; •adopt and maintain procedures, standards and training programs for control room operations; and•implement preventive and mitigating actions. In October 2015, PHMSA proposed changes to its pipeline safety regulations that would significantly extend the integrity management requirements to previously exempt pipelines and would impose additional obligations on pipeline operators that are already subject to the integrity management requirements. PHMSA’s proposed rule would also require annual reporting of safety-related conditions and incident reports for all gathering lines and gravity lines, including pipelines that are currently exempt from PHMSA regulations. PHMSA issued a separate regulatory proposal in July 2015 that would impose pipeline incident prevention and response measures on pipeline operators. Acceptance of the PHMSA proposals could have a material adverse effect on our operations and costs of transportation services. PHMSA has also issued an Advisory Bulletin which, among other things, advises pipeline operators that if they are relying on design, construction, inspection, testing or other data to determine the pressures at which their pipelines should operate, the records of that data must be traceable, verifiable and complete. Locating such records and, in the absence of any such records, verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the demands of such pressures, could significantly increase our costs. Additionally, failure to locate such records or verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures, which would reduce available capacity of our pipelines. While we believe that we are in compliance with existing safety laws and regulations, increased penalties for safety violations and potential regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our operations, operating and maintenance expenses, and revenues.Climate change legislation, regulatory initiatives and litigation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the services we provide.In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), such as carbon dioxide and methane that may be contributing to global warming. It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other initiatives are expected to be proposed that may be relevant to GHG emissions issues. In addition, almost half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. In general, the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Depending on the scope of a particular program, we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations (e.g., at compressor stations). Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that certain components of our operations, such as our gas-fired compressors, could become subject to state-level GHG-related regulation.Independent of Congress, the EPA has begun to adopt regulations under its existing Clean Air Act authority. In 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources of GHG emissions. In addition, in September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG-emitting sources in the United States beginning in 2011 for emissions in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding the reporting requirement to include onshore and offshore crude oil and natural gas systems beginning in 2012, which was again expanded in October 2015 to include additional crude oil and natural gas systems like gathering and boosting activities and onshore natural gas transmission pipelines. These rules require that we report our GHG emissions for certain of our assets. Further, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global GHG emissions. If and to the extent the United States implements this agreement, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and that of our customers.Although it is not possible at this time to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business, either directly or indirectly, any future federal or state laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions could require us to incur increased 30Table of Contentsoperating costs and could materially adversely affect demand for our services. The potential increase in the costs of our operations resulting from any legislation or regulation to restrict emissions of GHG could include new or increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our GHG emissions, pay any taxes related to our GHG emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program. While we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates we charge, such recovery of costs is uncertain. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for our services. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations.The implementation of statutory and regulatory requirements for swap transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities.Congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation under the Dodd-Frank Act that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. This legislation requires the CFTC and the SEC and other regulatory authorities to promulgate certain rules and regulations, including rules and regulations relating to the regulation of certain swaps market participants, such as swap dealers, the clearing of certain swaps through central counterparties, the execution of certain swaps on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities, mandatory margin requirements for uncleared swaps, and the reporting and recordkeeping of swaps. While most of the regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is still ongoing. Moreover, CFTC continues to refine its initial rulemakings under the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, we cannot yet predict the ultimate effect of the rules and regulations on our business and while most of the regulations have been adopted, any new regulations or modifications to existing regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts, limit the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties.The CFTC has proposed federal position limits on certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts in the major energy and other markets, with exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions provided that various conditions are satisfied. If finalized, the position limits rule and its companion rule on aggregation among entities under common ownership or control may have an impact on our ability to hedge our exposure to certain enumerated commodities.In 2013, the CFTC implemented final rules regarding mandatory clearing of certain classes of interest rate swaps and certain classes of index credit default swaps. Mandatory trading on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities of certain interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps also began in 2014. At this time, the CFTC has not proposed any rules designating other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, for mandatory clearing. The CFTC and prudential banking regulators also recently adopted mandatory margin requirements on uncleared swaps between swap dealers and certain other counterparties. Although we may qualify for a commercial end-user exception from the mandatory clearing, trade execution and uncleared swaps margin requirements, mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements and uncleared swaps margin requirements applicable to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may affect the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC is also directed generally to prevent price manipulation and fraud in the following two markets: (a) physical commodities traded in interstate commerce, including physical energy and other commodities, as well as (b) financial instruments, such as futures, options and swaps. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has adopted additional anti-market manipulation, anti-fraud and disruptive trading practices regulations that prohibit, among other things, fraud and price manipulation in the physical commodities, futures, options and swaps markets. Should we violate these laws and regulations, we could be subject to CFTC enforcement action and material penalties, and sanctions.We currently enter into forward contracts with third parties to buy power and sell natural gas in an attempt to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas with respect to those volumes. The CFTC has finalized an interpretation clarifying whether certain forwards with volumetric optionality are regulated as forwards or qualify as options on commodities and therefore swaps. This interpretation may have an impact on our ability to enter into certain forwards or may impose additional requirements with respect to certain transactions. In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act, the European Union and other foreign regulators have adopted and are implementing local reforms generally comparable with the reforms under the Dodd-Frank Act. Implementation and enforcement of these regulatory provisions may reduce our ability to hedge our market risks with non-U.S. counterparties and may make any transactions involving cross-border swaps more expensive and burdensome. 31Table of ContentsAdditionally, the lack of regulatory equivalency across jurisdictions may increase compliance costs and make it more costly to satisfy regulatory obligations. We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could result in disruptions to our operations.We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and we are, therefore, subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if we do not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate or if our pipelines are not properly located within the boundaries of such rights-of-way. We obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. If we were to be unsuccessful in renegotiating rights-of-way, we might have to relocate our facilities. Our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to these attacks or acts of war could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity or acts of war may have significant effects on general economic conditions, fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending and market liquidity, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business. Future terrorist attacks, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the United States or its allies, or military or trade disruptions may significantly affect our operations and those of our customers. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future attacks than other targets in the United States. Disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government-imposed price controls. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our operations depend on the use of information technology ("IT") systems that could be the target of a cyber-attack.Our operations depend on the use of sophisticated IT systems. Our IT systems and networks, as well as those of our customers, vendors and counterparties, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches, which in turn could result in the unauthorized release and misuse of confidential or proprietary information as well as disrupt our operations or damage our facilities or those of third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and increase our operating and capital costs, which could reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution. We may be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance our IT systems or to prevent or remediate any such attacks.Our ability to operate our business effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key management personnel.Our ability to operate our business and implement our strategies depends on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled management personnel with midstream energy industry experience and competition for these persons in the midstream energy industry is intense. Given our size, we may be at a disadvantage, relative to our larger competitors, in the competition for these personnel. We may not be able to continue to employ our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to retain or attract our senior executives and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively operate our business.A shortage of skilled labor in the midstream energy industry could reduce employee productivity and increase costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The operation of gathering, treating and processing systems requires skilled laborers in multiple disciplines such as equipment operators, mechanics and engineers, among others. We have from time to time encountered shortages for these types of skilled labor. If we experience shortages of skilled labor in the future, our labor and overall productivity or costs could be materially adversely affected. If our labor prices increase or if we experience materially increased health and benefit costs with respect to our general partner's employees, our business and results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected.32Table of ContentsRisks Inherent in an Investment in UsSummit Investments indirectly owns and controls our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations and limited duties to us and our unitholders. Our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interest with us and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our unitholders.Summit Investments controls our general partner and has authority to appoint all of the officers and directors of our general partner, some of whom will also be officers, directors or principals of Energy Capital Partners, the entity that controls Summit Investments. Although our general partner has a duty to manage us in a manner that is in our best interests, the directors and officers of our general partner also have a duty to manage our general partner in a manner that is in the best interests of its owner. Conflicts of interest will arise between Summit Investments and its owners and our general partner, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of Summit Investments and its owners over our interests and the interests of our unitholders. These conflicts include the following situations, among others:•Neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires Summit Investments or its owners to pursue a business strategy that favors us, and the directors and officers of Summit Investments have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of the owners of Summit Investments, which may be contrary to our interests. Summit Investments may choose to shift the focus of their investment and growth to areas not served by our assets.•Summit Investments is not limited in its ability to compete with us and may offer business opportunities or sell midstream assets to third parties without first offering us the right to bid for them.•Our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as Summit Investments and its owners, in resolving conflicts of interest.•Our partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by our general partner to us and our unitholders with contractual standards governing its duties to us and our unitholders. These contractual standards limit our general partner's liabilities and the rights of our unitholders with respect to actions that, without the limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.•Except in limited circumstances, our general partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval.•Our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuance of additional partnership interests and the creation, reduction or increase of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders.•Our general partner determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditures and whether a capital expenditure is classified as a maintenance capital expenditure, which reduces operating surplus, or an expansion capital expenditure, which does not reduce operating surplus. This determination can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders and to our general partner and the ability of the subordinated units to convert to common units.•Our general partner determines which costs incurred by it are reimbursable by us.•Our general partner may cause us to borrow funds to permit the payment of cash distributions, even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make incentive distribution payments.•Our partnership agreement permits us to classify up to $50.0 million as operating surplus, even if it is generated from asset sales, non-working capital borrowings or other sources that would otherwise constitute capital surplus. This cash may be used to fund distributions on our common units or to our general partner in respect of the general partner interest or the IDRs.•Our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf.•Our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations.•Our general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase all of the common units not owned by it and its affiliates if they own more than 80% of the common units.33Table of Contents•Our general partner controls the enforcement of the obligations that it and its affiliates owe to us.•Our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us.•Our general partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to our general partner's IDRs without the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner or our unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to our other unitholders in certain situations. Our general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.If Energy Capital Partners, the private equity firm that controls Summit Investments, consummates a transaction involving a sale or other disposition of its interests in Summit Invesments, the transaction would result in a change of control of SMLP because Summit Investments indirectly owns and controls our general partner. In addition, our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of Summit Investments to transfer all or a portion of its ownership interest in our general partner to a third party. The owner of Summit Investments, or new members of our general partner, as applicable, would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with their own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by the board of directors and officers. This effectively permits a change of control without the vote or consent of the unitholders.Our general partner's IDRs may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.Our general partner may transfer the IDRs it owns to a third party at any time without the consent of our unitholders. If our general partner transfers the IDRs to a third party but retains its general partner interest, our general partner may not have the same incentive to grow our business and increase quarterly distributions to unitholders over time as it would if it had retained ownership of the IDRs. For example, a transfer of the IDRs by our general partner could reduce the likelihood of Summit Investments selling or contributing additional midstream assets to us, as Summit Investments would have less of an economic incentive to grow our business, which in turn would impact our ability to grow our asset base.Our Sponsor is not limited in its ability to compete with us and is not obligated to offer us the opportunity to acquire additional assets or businesses, which could limit our ability to grow and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.Our Sponsor has significantly greater resources than us and has experience making investments in midstream energy businesses. Although it controls Summit Investments, our Sponsor may compete with us for investment opportunities and may own interests in entities that compete with us. Energy Capital Partners is not prohibited from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. In addition, Energy Capital Partners and Summit Investments may acquire, construct or dispose of additional midstream or other assets and may be presented with new business opportunities, without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct such assets or to engage in such business opportunities. Pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to our general partner, its officers and directors or any of its affiliates, including Summit Investments and our Sponsor and its respective executive officers, directors and principals. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity will not be liable to us or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of our general partner and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our unitholders.The amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our common units depends primarily on our cash flow rather than on our profitability, which may prevent us from making distributions, even during periods in which we record net income.The amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may make cash distributions during periods 34Table of Contentswhen we report net losses for GAAP purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when we report net income for GAAP purposes.The market price of our common units may fluctuate significantly and, due to limited daily trading volumes, an investor could lose all or part of its investment in us. Of the 42,062,644 common units outstanding at December 31, 2015, Summit Investments beneficially owned 5,444,731 common units and 24,409,850 subordinated units, which converted to common units on a one-for-one basis on February 16, 2016. In connection with the Purchase Program, a subsidiary of Energy Capital Partners had acquired 2,184,186 common units as of February 16, 2016. An investor may not be able to resell its common units at or above its acquisition price. Additionally, limited liquidity may result in wide bid-ask spreads, contribute to significant fluctuations in the market price of the common units and limit the number of investors who are able to buy the common units.The market price of our common units may decline and be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including among others:•our quarterly distributions; •our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;•the loss of a large customer;•announcements by our customers or others regarding our customers or changes in our customers’ credit ratings, liquidity position, leverage profile and/or other financial or credit-related metrics;•announcements by our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;•general economic and geopolitical conditions;•the failure of securities analysts to cover our common units or changes in financial estimates by analysts;•future sales of our common units, including those held by Summit Investments and its subsidiaries; and•other factors described in these Risk Factors. If we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results timely and accurately or prevent fraud, which would likely have a negative impact on the market price of our common units.As a publicly traded partnership, we are subject to the public reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the rules thereunder that will require our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports, prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded partnership. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls may not be successful and we may be unable to maintain effective controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.Given the difficulties inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, in addition to our limited accounting personnel and management resources, we can provide no assurance as to our or our independent registered public accounting firm's future conclusions about the effectiveness of our internal controls, and we may incur significant costs in our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our business and would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common units.Our partnership agreement replaces our general partner's fiduciary duties to unitholders with contractual standards governing its duties.Our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate fiduciary duties to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law and replaces those duties with several different contractual standards. For example, our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner or otherwise, free of any duties to us and our unitholders, other than the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This entitles our general 35Table of Contentspartner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners. Examples of decisions that our general partner may make in its individual capacity include, among others:•how to allocate corporate opportunities among us and its affiliates;•whether to exercise its limited call right;•whether to seek approval of the resolution of a conflict of interest by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner;•how to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it owns;•whether to exercise its registration rights;•whether to elect to reset target distribution levels;•whether to transfer the IDRs or any units it owns to a third party; and•whether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement. By purchasing a common unit, a common unitholder agrees to become bound by the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.Our partnership agreement limits the liabilities of our general partner and the rights of our unitholders with respect to actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.Our partnership agreement contains provisions that limit the liability of our general partner and the rights of our unitholders with respect to actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement provides that:•whenever our general partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our general partner, our general partner is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, meaning that it subjectively believed that the decision was in our best interests, and will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;•our general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as such decisions are made in good faith;•our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners or their assignees resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or its officers and directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal; and•our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its duties to us or our unitholders if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:i.approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner, although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval; ii.approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates;iii.on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties; oriv.fair and reasonable to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships among the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us. In connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, any determination by our general partner or the conflicts committee must be made in good faith. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee and the board of directors of our general partner determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to the affiliate transaction or conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in the final two subclauses above, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, the board of directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding 36Table of Contentsbrought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.Our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our obligations.Our general partner intends to limit its liability under contractual arrangements so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our general partner or its assets. Our general partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our general partner. Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our general partner's fiduciary duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions.We expect that we will distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders and will rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As a result, to the extent we are unable to finance growth externally, our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow.In addition, because we intend to distribute all of our available cash, we may not grow as quickly as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per-unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement, our amended and restated revolving credit facility or senior notes indentures on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may impact the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders.While our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all of our available cash, our partnership agreement, including provisions requiring us to make cash distributions contained therein, may be amended.While our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all of our available cash, our partnership agreement, including provisions requiring us to make cash distributions contained therein, may be amended. Our partnership agreement can be amended with the consent of our general partner and the approval of a majority of the outstanding common units (including common units held by affiliates of our general partner.) As of December 31, 2015, Summit Investments beneficially owned 5,444,731 common units out of 42,062,644 outstanding common units and all of our 24,409,850 subordinated units which converted to common units on a one-for-one basis on February 16, 2016. Additionally, in connection with the Purchase Program, a subsidiary of Energy Capital Partners had acquired 2,184,186 common units as of February 16, 2016.Reimbursements due to our general partner and its affiliates for expenses incurred on our behalf will reduce cash available for distribution to our common unitholders. The amount and timing of such reimbursements will be determined by our general partner.Prior to making any distribution on our common units, we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates, including Summit Investments, for expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf. Under our partnership agreement, we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for certain expenses incurred on our behalf, including, without limitation, salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to our general partner's employees and executive officers who provide services necessary to run our business. Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will determine in good faith the expenses that are allocable to us. The reimbursement of expenses to our general partner and its affiliates will reduce the amount of available cash to pay cash distributions to our unitholders.37Table of ContentsOur general partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the MQD and the target distribution levels related to our general partner's IDRs without the approval of the conflicts committee of our general partner's board or our unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to our unitholders in certain situations.Our general partner has the right, at any time when it has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled (48.0%) for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters (and the amount of each such distribution did not exceed adjusted operating surplus for such quarter), to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our cash distribution at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election by our general partner, the MQD will be reset to an amount equal to the average cash distribution per unit for the two fiscal quarters immediately preceding the reset election (such amount is referred to as the reset MQD), and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset MQD.In the event of a reset of target distribution levels, our general partner will be entitled to receive the number of common units equal to that number of common units that would have entitled it to an average aggregate quarterly cash distribution in the prior two quarters equal to the average of the distributions on the IDRs in the prior two quarters. Our general partner will also be issued the number of general partner units necessary to maintain its general partner interest in us that existed immediately prior to the reset election. We anticipate that our general partner would exercise this reset right to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such conversion; however, it is possible that our general partner could exercise this reset election at a time when we are experiencing declines in our aggregate cash distributions or at a time when our general partner expects that we will experience declines in our aggregate cash distributions in the foreseeable future. In such situations, our general partner may be experiencing, or may expect to experience, declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its IDRs and may therefore desire to be issued common units, which are entitled to specified priorities with respect to our distributions and which therefore may be more advantageous for the general partner to own in lieu of the right to receive incentive distribution payments based on target distribution levels that are less certain to be achieved in the then-current business environment. As a result, a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience dilution in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had we not issued common units to our general partner in connection with resetting the target distribution levels related to our general partner's IDRs.The New York Stock Exchange does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.We have listed our common units on the New York Stock Exchange. Because we are a publicly traded partnership, the New York Stock Exchange does not require us to have, and we do not intend to have, a majority of independent directors on our general partner's board of directors or to establish a nominating and corporate governance committee. Additionally, any future issuance of additional common units or other securities, including to affiliates, will not be subject to the New York Stock Exchange's shareholder approval rules. Accordingly, unitholders will not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements.Holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors.Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, holders of our common units have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business. Unitholders have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our general partner or its board of directors. The board of directors of our general partner has been chosen by Summit Investments. Furthermore, if our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they have little ability to remove our general partner. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. Our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of our unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders' ability to influence the manner or direction of management.Even if holders of our common units are dissatisfied, they may not be able to remove our general partner without its consent.The vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of all outstanding limited partner units voting together as a single class is required to remove our general partner. As of December 31, 2015, Summit Investments beneficially owned 38Table of Contents5,444,731 common units out of 42,062,644 outstanding common units and all of our 24,409,850 subordinated units which converted to common units on a one-for-one basis on February 16, 2016, representing a voting block sufficient to prevent the other limited partners from removing our general partner. Additionally, in connection with the Purchase Program, a subsidiary of Energy Capital Partners had acquired 2,184,186 common units as of February 16, 2016.Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.Unitholders' voting rights are further restricted by a provision of our partnership agreement providing that any person or group that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding cannot vote on any matter, other than our general partner, its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner.Our general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of Summit Investments to transfer all or a portion of its ownership interest in our general partner to a third party. The new owner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by the board of directors and officers. This effectively permits a change of control without the vote or consent of the unitholders.We may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing ownership interests.Our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests, including limited partner interests that rank senior to the common units that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:•our existing unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;•the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;•because the amount payable to holders of IDRs is based on a percentage of the total cash available for distribution, the distributions to holders of IDRs will increase even if the per-unit distribution on common units remains the same;•the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;•the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and•the market price of the common units may decline. Summit Investments or our Sponsor may sell units in the public or private markets, and such sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units.As of December 31, 2015, Summit Investments beneficially owned 5,444,731 common units out of 42,062,644 outstanding common units and all of our 24,409,850 subordinated units, which converted to common units on a one-for-one basis on February 16, 2016. We have agreed to provide Summit Investments with certain registration rights pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement. Additionally, in connection with the Purchase Program, a subsidiary of Energy Capital Partners had acquired 2,184,186 common units as of February 16, 2016. The sale of any of these units in the public or private markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market that may develop. 39Table of ContentsOur general partner has a limited call right that may require an investor to sell its units at an undesirable time or price.If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of our outstanding common units, our general partner will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, but not the obligation, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price that is not less than their then-current market price, as calculated pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement. As a result, an investor may be required to sell its common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on its investment. An investor may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of its units. As of December 31, 2015, Summit Investments beneficially owned 5,444,731 common units out of 42,062,644 outstanding common units and all of our 24,409,850 subordinated units, which converted to common units on a one-for-one basis on February 16, 2016. Additionally, in connection with the Purchase Program, a subsidiary of Energy Capital Partners had acquired 2,184,186 common units as of February 16, 2016. As such, our general partner and its affiliates controlled a total of 32,038,767 common units, or 48.2% of our common units outstanding as of February 16, 2016. An investor's liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business.A general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. Our partnership is organized under Delaware law, and we conduct business in a number of other states. The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some of the other states in which we do business. An investor could be liable for any and all of our obligations as if it was a general partner if a court or government agency were to determine that:•we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state's partnership statute; or•an investor's right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace our general partner, to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute control of our business. Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them.Under certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Delaware law, we may not make a distribution if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Substituted limited partners are liable both for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that were known to the substituted limited partner at the time it became a limited partner and for those obligations that were unknown if the liabilities could have been determined from the partnership agreement. Neither liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest nor liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.If an investor is not an eligible holder, it may not receive distributions or allocations of income or loss on those common units and those common units will be subject to redemption.We have adopted certain requirements regarding those investors who may own our common units. Eligible holders are U.S. individuals or entities subject to U.S. federal income taxation on the income generated by us or entities not subject to U.S. federal income taxation on the income generated by us, so long as all of the entity's owners are U.S. individuals or entities subject to such taxation. If an investor is not an eligible holder, our general partner may elect not to make distributions or allocate income or loss on that investor's units, and it runs the risk of having its units redeemed by us at the lower of purchase price cost or the then-current market price. The redemption price may be paid in cash or by delivery of a promissory note, as determined by our general partner.40Table of ContentsTax RisksOur tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which would subject us to entity-level taxation, then our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced.The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.Despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. A change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%, and would likely pay state and local income tax at varying rates. Distributions would generally be taxed again as corporate dividends (to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits), and no income, gains, losses, deductions, or credits would flow through to unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution would be substantially reduced. Therefore, if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, there would be material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.Our partnership agreement provides that, if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.If we were subjected to a material amount of additional entity-level taxation by individual states, it would reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.Changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Because of state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution. Our partnership agreement provides that, if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to entity-level taxation, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. For example, the Obama administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2016 recommends that certain publicly traded partnerships earning income from activities related to fossil fuels be taxed as corporations beginning in 2021. From time to time, members of Congress propose and consider such substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. If successful, the Obama administration’s proposal or other similar proposals could eliminate the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly traded partnerships as corporations, upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have issued proposed regulations concerning which activities give rise to qualifying income within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). We do not believe the proposed regulations affect our ability to qualify as a publicly traded partnership. However, finalized regulations could modify the amount of our gross income that we are able to treat as qualifying income for the purposes of the qualifying income requirement.Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units.41Table of ContentsOur unitholders' share of our income will be taxable to them for federal income tax purposes even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us.Because a unitholder will be treated as a partner to whom we will allocate taxable income that could be different in amount than the cash we distribute, a unitholder's allocable share of our taxable income will be taxable to it, which may require the payment of federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on its share of our taxable income even if the unitholder receives no cash distributions from us. Our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income.If the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take, and the IRS's positions may ultimately be sustained. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take and such positions may not ultimately be sustained. Any contest with the IRS, and the outcome of any IRS contest, may have an adverse impact on the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. In addition, our costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution.Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.If a unitholder sells its common units, a gain or loss will be recognized for federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the amount realized and the unitholder's tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of a unitholder's allocable share of its net taxable income decrease its tax basis in its common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the common units it sells will, in effect, become taxable income to the unitholder if it sells such common units at a price greater than its tax basis in those common units, even if the price it receives is less than its original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized on any sale of a unitholder's common units, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if a unitholder sells its common units, it may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash it receives from the sale.Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.Investment in common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts ("IRAs"), and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Distributions to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-U.S. persons will be required to file federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income. Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units.We will treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons, we will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from our unitholders' sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders' tax returns.We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first business day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge aspects of our proration method, and, if its challenge is successful, we would be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first business day of each month, instead of on the basis of the 42Table of Contentsdate a particular unit is transferred. The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS recently issued Treasury Regulations that permit publicly traded partnerships to use a monthly simplifying convention that is similar to our, but they do not specifically authorize all aspects of the proration method we have adopted. If the IRS were to successfully challenge this method, we could be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.A unitholder whose common units are loaned to a short seller to effect a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of those common units. If so, he would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.Because a unitholder whose common units are loaned to a short seller to effect a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned common units, he may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are advised to consult a tax advisor to discuss whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from loaning their common units.We have adopted certain valuation methodologies in determining a unitholder's allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction. The IRS may challenge these methodologies or the resulting allocations, and such a challenge could adversely affect the value of our common units.In determining the items of income, gain, loss and deduction allocable to our unitholders, in certain circumstances, including when we issue additional units, we must determine the fair market value of our assets. Although we may from time to time consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation matters, we make many fair market value estimates using a methodology based on the market value of our common units as a means to measure the fair market value of our assets. The IRS may challenge these valuation methods and the resulting allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction.A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount, character and timing of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders' sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders' tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.The sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes.We will be considered to have technically terminated our partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. For purposes of determining whether the 50% threshold has been met, multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once. Our technical termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders, which would result in us filing two tax returns (and our unitholders could receive two Schedules K-1 if relief was not available, as described below) for one fiscal year and would result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending December 31, the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in the unitholder's taxable income for the year of termination. Our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, but instead we would be treated as a new partnership for tax purposes. If treated as a new partnership, we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred. The IRS has announced a publicly traded partnership technical termination relief program whereby, if a publicly traded partnership that technically terminated requests publicly traded partnership technical termination relief and such relief is granted by the IRS, among other things, the partnership will only have to provide one Schedule K-1 to unitholders for the year notwithstanding two partnership tax years.If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, it may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders could be substantially reduced.43Table of ContentsPursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns, it may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us. Generally, we expect to elect to have our general partner and our unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, but there can be no assurance that such election will be effective in all circumstances. If we are unable to have our general partner and our unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own our units during the tax year under audit. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders could be substantially reduced. These rules are not applicable to us for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017.As a result of investing in our common units, our unitholders may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire properties.In addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or control property now or in the future, even if the unitholders do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. Some of the states in which we conduct business currently impose a personal income tax on individuals. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may control assets or conduct business in additional states that impose a personal income tax. It is the unitholder's responsibility to file all federal, state and local tax returns.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable.
