Item 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained herein or incorporated herein by reference, the risks and uncertainties and other factors described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price and could also cause our future business, financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from the results contemplated by any forward-looking statement we may make herein, in any other document we file with the SEC, or in any press release or other written or oral statement we may make. Please also see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition And Results of OperationsÂ—Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for additional risks and uncertainties applicable to us. Our business is subject to intense competition. Royalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensees' net sales of licensed products. Cherokee, Carole Little and Sideout brand footwear, apparel, and accessories, which are manufactured and sold by both domestic and international wholesalers and retail licensees, are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies. Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands such as Faded Glory, Arizona, and Route 66, developed by retailers. Competitors with respect to the Sideout brand include Quiksilver, Nike and other active wear companies. Factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price and the manufacturer's ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis. In recognition of the increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and greater emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of private label merchandise, in the United States our business plan focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers. Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, our licensees' ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to respond to ever-changing consumer demands, and any significant failure by our licensees to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We cannot control the level of resources that our licensees commit to supporting our brands, and our licensees may choose to support other brands to the detriment of ours. There are numerous risk factors that apply to the businesses of retailers that can affect their level of sales of products that carry our brands. Any decline in sales by our licensees can adversely affect our revenues. Factors that may adversely affect retailers include the following: weather; changes in the availability or cost of capital; shifts in the seasonality of shopping patterns; labor strikes or other work interruptions including work interruptions that impact supply chains and transport vendors; the impact of excess retail capacity; changes in the cost of accepting various payment methods and changes in the rate of utilization of these payment methods; material acquisitions or dispositions; investments in new business strategies; the success or failure of significant new business ventures or technologies; actions taken or omitted to be taken by legislative, regulatory, judicial and other governmental authorities and officials; and natural disasters, the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events. In addition, other companies owning established trademarks could also enter into similar arrangements with retailers, including our existing retail partners, competing for limited floor pad and rack space. 10 Table of Contents Our business is largely dependent on royalties from two licensees, Target and Tesco, which accounted for 42.1% and 27.1%, respectively, of our consolidated licensing revenues in Fiscal 2011. During Fiscal 2011, 42.1% of our licensing revenues were generated from Target and 27.1% of our licensing revenues were generated from Tesco. We could suffer substantially decreased royalty revenues and cash flow under the Restated Target Agreement if Target were to reduce its sales of Cherokee branded products while continuing to pay the minimum royalties of $9.0 million per fiscal year required under such agreement. We are unsure whether we would be able to replace the royalty payments received from Target and Tesco. The termination of either of these license agreements would have a material adverse effect upon our revenues and cash flow. Together, these two licensees accounted for approximately 69.2% of our consolidated licensing revenues in Fiscal 2011. Our business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions and the current global financial crisis. Our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and its corresponding impact on the levels of consumer spending which may effect our licensees' sales. Consumer spending is showing signs of stabilization; however it is difficult to predict future levels of consumer spending and any such predictions are inherently uncertain. The worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles. Purchases of apparel and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income typically declines. Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industries, including, among others, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. During periods of economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues. As a result, our operating results may be materially affected by trends in the United States or global economy. The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession. In addition to other consequences, these periods may be accompanied by decreased consumer spending generally, as well as decreased demand for, or additional downward pricing pressure on, the products carrying our brands. Accordingly, any prolonged economic slowdown or a lengthy or severe recession with respect to either the U.S. or the global economy is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. Our business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the strength of our brands. Our success to date has been due in large part to the strength of our brands. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the strength of our brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider one or more of our brands to be outdated or associate one or more of our brands with styles that are no longer popular. In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses. Our business may be similarly affected in the future. We are dependent on our intellectual property, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully protect our rights. We hold various trademarks including Cherokee, Sideout, Carole Little and others in connection with apparel, footwear, home and accessories. These trademarks are vital to the success and future growth of our business. These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in numerous other countries. We also hold several trademark applications for Cherokee and 11 Table of Contents Sideout in other countries. There can be no assurance that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others, or prevent the loss of licensing revenue or other damages caused thereby. In addition, the laws of several countries in which we have licensed our intellectual property may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In the future we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties, and there can be no assurance that one or more parties will not assert infringement claims against us. Any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management personnel whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor. We must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems. We rely on various information technology systems, including our newly purchased enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that will be fully implemented by the first quarter of Fiscal 2012, to manage our operations, which subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our information technology, potential disruption of our internal control systems, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or difficulties in upgrading, transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems. We are dependent on our key management personnel and we recently appointed a new Chief Executive Officer and a new Chief Financial Officer. Our success is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key executives, including, Henry Stupp, our Chief Executive Officer, Howard Siegel, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Mark DiSiena, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a limited number of employees and Mr. Stupp's and our other executives' leadership and experience in the apparel licensing industry is important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategy. We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our executives. The loss of the services of Mr. Stupp or our other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, on August 26, 2010, we experienced a transition in our executive management team, in connection with the appointment of Henry Stupp as our Chief Executive Officer and the appointment of our former Chief Executive Officer, Robert Margolis, as our Executive Chairman, who resigned from Cherokee on January 28, 2011. Further, on November 5, 2010 we announced that our former Chief Financial Officer, Russell J. Riopelle, would be leaving Cherokee in mid December 2010. On November 11, 2010, we announced that we hired Mark DiSiena, who replaced Mr. Riopelle as our Chief Financial Officer following Mr. Riopelle's departure from Cherokee on December 17, 2010. Our former Executive Chairman, Robert Margolis, resigned from Cherokee on January 28, 2011. Neither Mr. Stupp nor Mr. DiSiena has worked with our existing executive management team prior to their joining us last year. We cannot assure you that either of these management transitions will not result in some disruption of our business. If either our new Chief Executive Officer or our new Chief Financial Officer is unable to work with our existing management team to implement our strategies, manage our operations and accomplish our objectives, our business, operations and financial results could be impaired. 12 Table of Contents We recently consummated a debt financing of $10,000,000 in principal in order to enable us to meet our payment obligations to our former Executive Chairman. In connection with the resignation of our former Executive Chairman, Robert Margolis, on January 28, 2011, we entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release of all Claims (the "Separation Agreement"), with Mr. Margolis. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, (i) on February 17, 2011, we paid Mr. Margolis a one-time lump sum payment equal to $2,260,000 and (ii) on April 1, 2011, we paid Mr. Margolis his final annual performance bonus for Fiscal 2011 of $1.8 million. In addition, pursuant to the Separation Agreement, on February 7, 2011, we repurchased 400,000 shares (the "Repurchase Shares") of our Common Stock for aggregate proceeds of $7,260,000. As payment for the Repurchase Shares, we issued promissory notes to affiliates of Mr. Margolis in the principal amount of $7,260,000 (collectively, the "Margolis Notes"). The Margolis Notes bore interest at an annual rate of 3% and were repaid by us in full on February 17, 2011. In order to repay the Margolis Notes and meet our other obligations to Mr. Margolis under the Separation Agreement, on February 16, 2011, we entered into a term loan agreement with U.S. Bank (the "Bank") pursuant to which we borrowed $10,000,000 in principal (the "Loan Facility") and which bears interest at a floating rate equal to either (i) the Bank's prime rate minus 0.25% or (ii) 2.75% plus the 1, 2 or 3 month LIBOR rate, a selected by Cherokee pursuant to the terms of the Loan Facility. The Loan Facility is to be repaid in equal monthly installments of $277,778 over the next three years following the date of the loan. The Loan Facility is secured by all of Cherokee's assets and guaranteed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiary, Spell C. LLC. We may not pay dividends regularly or at all in the future. Although we have paid dividends during each quarter since December 2003, and including during the first quarter of Fiscal 2012, our Board of Directors may reduce or discontinue dividends at any time for any reason it deems relevant and there can be no assurances that we will continue to generate excess cash to pay dividends, or that we will continue to pay dividends with such excess cash if other, more compelling business opportunities are available, as determined by our Board of Directors. Our ability to generate excess cash from our operations in the future is dependent upon a variety of factors, including Cherokee's financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors. In Fiscal 2011, we paid a total of $13.5 million in dividends, which was materially greater than our net income of $7.7 million for Fiscal 2011. In recognition of the fact that our payment of dividends could not continue at historical levels beyond Fiscal 2011 unless cash flow from operations increases substantially, on January 31, 2011, we announced that we further reduced our future quarterly dividend payments from $0.38 per share to $0.20 per share, which more closely aligned our dividend payments with our expected cash flow from operations while allowing us to retain a portion of our cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations and to invest in our business. Should our future dividend payments exceed our cash from operations, we will reduce the excess cash on our balance sheet and our Board of Directors may elect to further reduce or eliminate future dividend payments. Furthermore, should the dividend tax laws change such that taxes on dividends become higher than they currently are, we may further reduce or eliminate the dividends we pay to our stockholders in favor of other ways to increase value for our stockholders. The trading price of our stock may be volatile. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be subject to fluctuations as a result of various factors impacting our business, including (i) our financial results, (ii) announcements by us, our retail partners or by our competitors, as applicable, regarding or affecting the retail environment either domestically or internationally, our existing license agreements, our existing brand representations, new license agreements, new brand representations or strategic alliances or other agreements, (iii) recruitment or departure of key personnel, (iv) changes in the estimates of our financial results or 13 Table of Contents changes in the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock, and (v) market conditions in the retail industry and the economy as a whole. Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock. Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock, without action by our stockholders. Such shares of preferred stock may be issued on terms determined by our Board of Directors, and may have rights, privileges and preferences superior to those of our common stock. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to our common stock, (ii) such shares of preferred stock could have voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and (iii) the ownership interest of holders of our common stock will be diluted following the issuance of any such shares of preferred stock.
