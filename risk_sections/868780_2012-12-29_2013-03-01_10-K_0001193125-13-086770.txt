Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations. We May Lose Business to Competitors. Competition within the automotive aftermarket parts business is intense. We compete in North America with both original equipment parts manufacturers and with companies that, like us, supply parts only to the automotive aftermarket. We expect such competition to continue. If we are unable to compete successfully in our industry we could lose customers. Unfavorable Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Business. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or instability in the financial markets or credit markets may either lower demand for our products or increase our operational costs, or both. Such conditions may also materially impact our customers, suppliers and other parties with whom we do business. Our revenue will be adversely affected if demand for our products declines. The impact of unfavorable economic conditions may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased. As a result, reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivables may increase and failure to collect a significant portion of amounts due on those receivables could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 7 Table of Contents The Loss or Decrease in Sales Among One of Our Top Customers Could Have a Substantial Negative Impact on Our Sales and Operating Results. A significant percentage of our sales has been, and will continue to be, concentrated among a relatively small number of customers. During fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, four customers (AutoZone, Advance Auto Parts, OReilly Auto Parts and Genuine Parts Co.) each accounted for more than 10% and in the aggregate accounted for 57% of net sales in each period. We anticipate that this concentration of sales among customers will continue in the future. The loss of a significant customer or a substantial decrease in sales to such a customer could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results. Customer Consolidation in the Automotive Aftermarket May Lead to Customer Contract Terms Less Favorable to Us Which May Negatively Impact Our Financial Results. The automotive aftermarket has been consolidating over the past several years. As a result, many of our customers have grown larger and therefore have more leverage in the arms-length negotiations of agreements with us for the sale of our products. Customers may require us to provide extended payment terms and returns of slow moving product in order to obtain new or retain existing business. While we attempt to avoid or minimize such concessions, in some cases payment terms to customers have been extended and returns of product have exceeded historical levels. The product returns primarily affect our profit levels while payment terms extensions generally reduce operating cash flow and require additional capital to finance the business. We expect both of these trends to continue for the foreseeable future. The Cancellation or Rescheduling of Orders May Cause Our Operating Results to Fluctuate. The cancellation or rescheduling of orders may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Although we make every reasonable effort to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers business needs or overall market demand for our products. Additionally, although we serve more than 2,800 individual accounts, the cancellation or rescheduling of orders by larger customers may still have a material adverse effect on our operating results from time to time. Our Business May be Negatively Impacted By Foreign Currency Fluctuations and Our Dependence on Foreign Suppliers. In fiscal 2012, approximately 80% of our products were purchased from vendors in a variety of foreign countries. The products generally are purchased through purchase orders with the purchase price specified in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we do not have exposure to fluctuations in the relationship between the dollar and various foreign currencies between the time of execution of the purchase order and payment for the product. To the extent that the dollar decreases in value relative to foreign currencies in the future, the price of the product in dollars for new purchase orders may increase. The largest portion of our overseas purchases is from China. Since June 2010, the Chinese Yuan has increased approximately 7.2% relative to the U.S. Dollar. A continued increase in the value of the Yuan relative to the U.S. Dollar will likely result in an increase in the cost of products that we purchase from China. As a result of the magnitude of our foreign sourcing, our business may be subject to risks, including the following:  uncertainty caused by the elimination of import quotas and the possible imposition of additional quotas or antidumping or countervailing duties or other retaliatory or punitive trade measures;  imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports;  significant devaluation of the dollar against foreign currencies;  restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries;  political instability, military conflict or terrorism involving the United States or any of the countries where our products are manufactured, which could cause a delay in transportation or an increase in costs of transportation, raw materials or finished product or otherwise disrupt our business operations; and  disease, epidemics and health-related concerns could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny and embargoing of goods produced in infected areas. If these risks limit or prevent us from acquiring products from foreign suppliers or significantly increase the cost of our products, our operations could be seriously disrupted until alternative suppliers are found, which could negatively impact our business. 8 Table of Contents We Extend Credit to Our Customers Who May Be Unable to Pay In the Future. We regularly extend credit to our customers. A significant percentage of our accounts receivable have been, and will continue to be concentrated among a relatively small number of automotive retailers and automotive parts distributors in the United States. Our five largest customers accounted for 86% and 83% of total accounts receivable as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Management continually monitors the credit terms and credit limits of these and other customers. If any of these customers were unable to pay, our business and financial condition would be adversely affected. The Loss of a Key Vendor Could Lead to Increased Costs and Lower Profit Margins. The majority of the products we sell are purchased from a number of foreign vendors. If any of our existing vendors fail to meet our needs, we believe that sufficient capacity exists in the open market to supply any shortfall that may result. Nevertheless, it is not always possible to replace a key vendor without a disruption in our operations and replacement of a significant vendor is often at higher prices. Limited Shelf Space May Adversely Affect Our Ability to Expand Our Product Offerings. Since the amount of space available to a retailer and other purchasers of our products is limited, our products compete with other automotive aftermarket products, some of which are entirely dissimilar and otherwise non-competitive (such as car waxes and engine oil), for shelf and floor space. No assurance can be given that additional space will be available in our customers stores to support the expansion of the number of products that we offer. If We Do Not Continue to Develop New Products and Bring Them to Market, Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations Could Be Materially Impacted. The development and production of new products is often accompanied by design and production delays and related costs typically associated with the development and production of new products. While we expect and plan for such delays and related costs, we cannot predict with precision the time and expense required to overcome these initial problems so that the products comply with specifications. There is a risk that we may not be able to introduce or bring to full-scale production new products as quickly as we expected in our product introduction plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. An Increase in Patent Filings by Original Equipment Manufacturers Could Negatively Impact Our Ability to Develop New Products. We have seen an increase in patent requests for new designs made by original equipment manufacturers. If original equipment manufacturers are able to obtain patents on new designs at a rate higher than historical levels, we could be restricted or prohibited from selling aftermarket products covered by such items until such patents expire, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Quality Problems with Our Products Could Damage Our Reputation and Adversely Affect Our Business. We have experienced, and in the future may experience, reliability, quality, or compatibility problems in products after their production and sale to customers. Product quality problems could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customers, a decrease in revenue, litigation, unexpected expenses, and a loss of market share. We have invested and will continue to invest in our engineering, design, and quality infrastructure in an effort to reduce and eventually eliminate these problems; however, there can be no assurance that we can successfully remedy all of these issues. To the extent we experience significant quality problems in the future our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. Loss of Third-Party Transportation Providers Upon Whom We Depend or Increases in Fuel Prices Could Increase Our Costs or Cause a Disruption in Our Operations. We depend upon third-party transportation providers for delivery of our products to us and to our customers. Strikes, slowdowns, transportation disruptions or other conditions in the transportation industry, including, but not limited to, shortages of truck drivers, disruptions in rail service, decreases in ship building or increases in fuel prices, could increase our costs and disrupt our operations and our ability to service our customers on a timely basis. 9 Table of Contents We May Not Properly Execute, or Realize Anticipated Cost Savings or Benefits from, Our Ongoing Information Technology Initiatives. Our success is partly dependent on properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, our ongoing information technology initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make us more efficient in the development, acquisition and distributions of our products, which is necessary in our highly competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an interruption to our business functions. Unfavorable Results of Legal Proceedings Could Materially Adversely Affect Us. We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary course of our business which are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future. Although we currently believe that resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, legal claims and proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainty and our view on these matters may change in the future. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and operating results. We Have No History of Paying Regular Dividends And Do Not Intend to Pay Regular Dividends. On December 5, 2012, we announced a special cash dividend of $1.50 per share payable on December 28, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 17, 2012. This special cash dividend notwithstanding, we do not intend to pay regular cash dividends. Rather, for the foreseeable future, we intend to retain our earnings, if any, for the operation and continued expansion of our business. Dormans Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and His Family Members Control the Company. As of February 22, 2013, Steven L. Berman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and director of Dorman Products, Inc., and his family members beneficially own approximately 31% of the outstanding Common Stock, have a controlling influence over the election of the Board of Directors and the outcome of most corporate actions requiring shareholder approval (including certain fundamental transactions) and the affairs of the Company. Such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of the Company, could deprive shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. Our Success Depends on the Efforts of Our Management Team. The success of our business will continue to be dependent upon Steven L. Berman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer, other executive officers and key employees and our ability to attract and retain other skilled managers. The loss of the services of any of these individuals for an extended period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our operations, revenues and operating results, and the operations of our third party manufacturers, suppliers and customers, may be subject to quarter to quarter fluctuations and disruptions from events beyond our or their control. Our operations, revenues and operating results, as well as the operations of our third party manufacturers, suppliers and customers, may be subject to quarter to quarter fluctuations and disruptions from a variety of causes outside of our or their control, including work stoppages, market volatility, acts of war, terrorism, cyber incidents, pandemics, fire, earthquake, flooding, changes in weather patterns, weather or seasonal fluctuations or other climate-based changes, including hurricanes or tornadoes, or other natural disasters. If a major disruption were to occur at our operations or the operations of our third party manufacturers, suppliers or customers, it could result in harm to people or the natural environment, delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues and operating results. 10 Table of Contents Item 1B.
