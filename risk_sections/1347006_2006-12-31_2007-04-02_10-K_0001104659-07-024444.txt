risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our securities will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a target business. ACQUISITIONS THAT WE MAY UNDERTAKE WOULD INVOLVE A NUMBER OF INHERENT RISKS, ANY OF WHICH COULD CAUSE US NOT TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED TO RESULT. It is possible that, following our initial acquisition, our strategy will include expanding our operations and other capabilities through acquisitions of businesses and assets. Acquisition transactions involve various inherent risks, such as: · uncertainties in assessing the value, strengths and potential profitability of, and identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks, contingent and other liabilities (including environmental liabilities) of, acquisition or other transaction candidates; · the potential loss of key customers, management and employees of an acquired business; · the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction; · problems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business; and · unanticipated changes in business, industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition or other transaction rationale. Any one or more of these factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition of businesses or assets or could result in unexpected liabilities associated with these acquisition candidates. 32 RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDIA, ENTERTAINMENT AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES THE MEDIA, ENTERTAINMENT AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY CYCLICAL, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND, IN TURN, HURT OUR PROFITABILITY. Media, entertainment and telecommunications products and services tend to be relatively expensive and buyers tend to defer purchases during periods of economic weakness. Conversely, during periods of economic strength, media, entertainment and telecommunications sales frequently exceed expectations. As a consequence, revenues and earnings for media, entertainment and telecommunications companies may fluctuate more than those of less economically sensitive companies. Due to the cyclical nature of these media, entertainment and telecommunications industries, inventories may not always be properly balanced, resulting in lost sales when there are shortages or write-offs when there are excess inventories. This may adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of any target businesses that we may acquire. THE SPECULATIVE NATURE OF THE MEDIA, ENTERTAINMENT AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Certain segments of the media, entertainment and telecommunications industries are highly speculative and historically have involved a substantial degree of risk. For example, the success of a particular service or entertainment offering depends upon unpredictable and changing factors, including the success of promotional efforts, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions, public acceptance and other tangible and intangible factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we complete a business combination with a target business in such a segment, our operations may be adversely affected. CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY MAY REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES WE MAY OFFER FOLLOWING A BUSINESS COMBINATION. The media, entertainment and telecommunications industries are substantially affected by rapid and significant changes in technology. These changes may reduce the demand for certain existing services and technologies used in these industries or render them obsolete. We cannot assure you that the technologies used by or relied upon or produced by a target business with which we effect a business combination will not be subject to such occurrence. While we may attempt to adapt and apply the services provided by the target business to newer technologies, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to fund these changes or that these changes will ultimately prove successful. IF, FOLLOWING A BUSINESS COMBINATION, THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT WE MARKET OR SELL ARE NOT ACCEPTED BY THE PUBLIC, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Certain segments of the media, entertainment and telecommunications industries are dependent on developing and marketing new products and services that respond to technological and competitive developments and changing customer needs and tastes. We cannot assure you that the products and services of a target business with which we effect a business combination will gain market acceptance. Any significant delay or failure in developing new or enhanced technology, including new product and service offerings, could result in a loss of actual or potential market share and a decrease in revenues. THE MEDIA, ENTERTAINMENT AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY UPON CONSUMMATION OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION. The media, entertainment and telecommunications industries are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. We expect competition to intensify in the future. Many of the competitors we will face upon consummation of 33 a business combination may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, the management of our competitors may have greater operating resources and experience in their respective industries. Some of these competitors may also offer a wider range of services than we can and have greater name recognition and a larger client base. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities, technologies and client requirements. They may also be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to clients, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. If we are unable to compete effectively following a business combination, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS THAT MAY BE ADOPTED WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDIA, ENTERTAINMENT OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES. Certain segments of the media, entertainment and telecommunications industries, including wireline and wireless telecommunications networks, broadcast networks and radio stations, have historically been subject to substantial government regulation. In the past, the regulatory environment, particularly with respect to the telecommunications industry and the television and radio industry, has been fairly rigid. In addition to regulations we may be subject to following a business combination, we may also be required to seek Federal Communications Commission or other regulatory approvals in order to consummate our initial business combination. Obtaining such approvals may cause delays which may hinder our ability to consummate our initial business combination within the required time frame. We cannot assure you that regulations currently in effect or adopted in the future will not have a material adverse affect on our ability to acquire a particular media, entertainment or telecommunications target or on any target business acquired by us. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT OR ENFORCE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY TARGET BUSINESSES THAT WE ACQUIRE. After completing a business combination, the procurement and protection of trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets will be critical to our success. We will likely rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect any proprietary technology and rights that we may acquire. Despite our efforts to protect those proprietary technology and rights, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of those proprietary rights or deter independent development of technologies that compete with the business we acquire. Our competitors may file patent applications or obtain patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our patents. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. It is also possible that third parties may claim we have infringed their patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights. Claims or litigation, with or without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversions of resources, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and business. Depending on the target business or businesses that we acquire, it is likely that we will have to protect copyrights, trademarks, patents, and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful in every location. With respect to certain proprietary rights, such as trademarks and copyrighted materials, of the target business or businesses that we will acquire, we expect that the target business or businesses will have entered into license agreements in the past and will continue to enter into such agreements in the future. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of such target business or businesses proprietary rights or cause harm to such target business or businesses reputation. 34 IF WE ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE INFRINGED ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES, IT COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES AND INVALIDATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. If, following a business combination, third parties allege that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights, privacy rights or publicity rights or have defamed them, we could become a party to litigation. These claims and any resulting lawsuits could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights and restrict our ability to publish and distribute the infringing or defaming content. SINCE WE MAY ACQUIRE A TARGET BUSINESS IN THE MEDIA, ENTERTAINMENT OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES THAT IS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WE MAY ENCOUNTER RISKS SPECIFIC TO ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE ULTIMATELY OPERATE. If we acquire a company that has operations outside the United States, we will be exposed to risks that could negatively impact our future results of operations following a business combination. Additionally, if the acquired company is in a developing country our operations may not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected in the United States. The additional risks we may be exposed to in these cases include but are not limited to: · tariffs and trade barriers; · regulations related to customs and import/export matters; · tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States; · cultural and language differences; · an inadequate banking system; · foreign exchange controls; · restrictions on the repatriation of profits or payment of dividends; · crime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars; · nationalization or expropriation of property; · law enforcement authorities and courts that are inexperienced in commercial matters; and · deterioration of political relations with the United States. FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. A target business with which we combine may do business and generate sales within other countries. Foreign currency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur in such international operations. It is also possible that some or all of our operating expenses may be incurred in non-U.S. dollar currencies. The appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies in those countries where we have operations against the U.S. dollar would increase our costs and could harm our results of operations and financial condition. EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND WITHHOLDING TAXES MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE OUR CASH FLOW. If we combine with a target business that has operations outside the United States, we may be subject to existing or future rules and regulations on currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes on dividends that may affect our ability to utilize our cash flow effectively, repatriate profits or pay dividends.
