Item 1A. Risk Factors Because of these restrictions, we may be limited in the amount of stock that we can issue to make acquisitions in the two years subsequent to the spin off and merger. Also, our indemnity obligation to Alltel might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control during this two-year period that our stockholders may consider favorable. The foregoing restrictions will expire on July 17, 2008. Disruption in our networks and infrastructure may cause us to lose customers and incur additional expenses. To be successful, we will need to continue to provide our customers with reliable service over our networks. Some of the risks to our networks and infrastructure include: physical damage to access lines, breaches of security, capacity limitations, power surges or outages, software defects and disruptions beyond our control, such as natural disasters and acts of terrorism. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we will experience short disruptions in our service due to factors such as cable damage, inclement weather and service failures of our third party service providers. We could experience more significant disruptions in the future. We could also face disruptions due to capacity limitations if changes in our customersÂ’ usage patterns for our high-speed Internet services result in a significant increase in capacity utilization, such as through increased usage of video or peer-to-peer file sharing applications. Disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers and incur expenses, and thereby adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flows. Weak economic conditions may decrease demand for our services. We could be sensitive to economic conditions and downturns in the economy. Downturns in the economy and vendor concentration in the markets we serve could cause our existing customers to reduce their purchases of our basic and enhanced services and make it difficult for us to obtain new customers. Adverse developments in our relationship with our employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 1,819 of our employees, or 24 percent of all of our employees, at various sites were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our relationship with these unions generally has been satisfactory, but occasional work stoppages have occurred. Within the last five years, one work stoppage occurred at our facility in Lexington, Kentucky, which involved approximately 350 employees and lasted approximately 120 days. Any work stoppages in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are currently party to 20 collective bargaining agreements with several unions, which expire at various times. Of these collective bargaining agreements, 9 agreements covering a total of approximately 763 employees as of December 31, 2007 are due to expire in 2008, including one contract covering approximately 500 employees in the former Valor market that expired February 28, 2008, and remain subject to continuing renewal negotiations. Historically, we have succeeded in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements without work stoppages; however, no assurances can be given that we will succeed in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements to replace the expiring ones without work stoppages. Any work stoppage in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Item 1B.
