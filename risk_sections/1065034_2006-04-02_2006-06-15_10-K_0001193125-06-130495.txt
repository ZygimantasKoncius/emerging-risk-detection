ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business faces many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. We were incorporated in April 1997 and introduced our first major software product, Blast Fusion, in April 1999. We have a limited history of generating revenue from our software products, and the revenue and income potential of our business and market is still unproven. As a result of our short operating history, we have limited financial data that can be used to evaluate our business. We have only been profitable in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004. Our software products represent a new approach to the challenges presented in the electronic design automation market, which to date has been dominated by established companies with longer operating histories. Key markets within the electronic design automation industry may fail to adopt our proprietary technologies and use our software products. Any evaluation of our business and our prospects must be considered in light of our limited operating history and the risks and uncertainties often encountered by relatively young companies. We have a history of losses, except for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $136.6 million as of April 2, 2006; if we continue to incur losses, the trading price of our stock would be likely to decline. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately $136.6 million as of April 2, 2006. Except for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, we incurred losses in all other fiscal years. If we continue to incur losses, or if we fail to achieve profitability at levels expected by securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock is likely to decline. If we incur net losses, we may not be able to maintain or increase our number of employees or our investment in capital equipment, sales, marketing, and research and development programs, and we may not be able to continue to operate. Our quarterly results are difficult to predict, and if we miss quarterly financial expectations, our stock price is likely to decline. Our quarterly revenue and operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict. It is likely that our operating results in some periods will be below investor expectations. If this happens, the market price of our common stock is likely to decline. Fluctuations in our future quarterly operating results may be caused by many factors, including:  size and timing of customer orders, which are received unevenly and unpredictably throughout a fiscal year;  the mix of products licensed and types of license agreements;  our ability to recognize revenue in a given quarter;  higher than anticipated costs in connection with litigation with Synopsys, Inc.;  timing of customer license payments;  the relative mix of time-based licenses bundled with maintenance, unbundled time-based license agreements and perpetual license agreements, each of which has different revenue recognition practices; 12 Table of Contents  size and timing of revenue recognized in advance of actual customer billings and customers with graduated payment schedules which may result in higher accounts receivable balances and days sales outstanding (DSO);  the relative mix of our license and services revenue;  our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers;  changes in our pricing and discounting practices and licensing terms and those of our competitors;  changes in the level of our operating expenses, including increases in incentive compensation payments that may be associated with future revenue growth;  variability in stock-based compensation charges related to our option exchange program;  changes in the interpretation of the authoritative literature under which we recognize revenue;  the timing of product releases or upgrades by us or our competitors; and  the integration, by us or our competitors, of newly-developed or acquired products. We currently face lawsuits brought by Synopsys, Inc. related to patent infringement, and we may face additional intellectual property infringement claims or other litigation. Lawsuits can be costly to defend, can take the time of our management and employees away from day-to-day operations, and could result in our losing important rights and paying significant damages. As described below, Synopsys, Inc. has filed various suits, including for patent infringement, against us (please see the discussion in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.) In addition, as described below, a putative shareholder class action lawsuit and a putative derivative lawsuit have been filed against us (please see the discussion in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.) Other related litigation may follow. In the future other parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers. We may have acquired or may in the future acquire software as a result of our acquisitions, and we could be subject to claims that such software infringes the intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, we are often involved in or threatened with commercial litigation unrelated to intellectual property infringement claims such as labor litigation and contract claims, and we may acquire companies that are actively engaged in such litigation. Our products may be found to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, including third-party patents. In addition, many of our contracts contain provisions in which we agree to indemnify our customers from third-party intellectual property infringement claims that are brought against them based on their use of our products. Also, we may be unaware of filed patent applications that relate to our software products. We believe the patent portfolios of our competitors are far larger than ours, and this may increase the risk that they may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross-licenses. The outcome of intellectual property litigation, such as the pending Synopsys litigation (discussed herein) and other types of litigation, could be, in the case of intellectual property litigation, our loss of critical proprietary rights and, in the case of intellectual property litigation and other types of litigation, unexpected operating costs and substantial monetary damages. Intellectual property litigation and other types of litigation are expensive and time-consuming and could divert managements attention from our business. If there is a successful claim of infringement, we may be ordered to pay substantial monetary damages (including punitive damages), we may be prevented from distributing all or some of our products, and we may be required to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business. Publicly announced developments in our litigation matters may cause our stock price to decline sharply and suddenly. Other factors may reduce the market price of our common stock, and we are subject to ongoing risks of securities class action litigation related to volatility in the market price for our common stocks. 13 Table of Contents We may not be successful in defending some or all claims that may be brought against us. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can result in substantial expense and could divert the efforts of our management and technical personnel from our business. In addition, the ultimate resolution of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and harm our ability to execute our business plan. We may not be able to hire and/or retain the number of qualified personnel required for our business, particularly engineering personnel, which would harm the development and sales of our products and limit our ability to grow. Competition in our industry for senior management, technical, sales, marketing and other key personnel is intense. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified personnel, our growth may be limited due to a lack of capacity to develop and market our products. In particular, we continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth strategy. Our success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified engineering personnel with experience in integrated circuit design. Specifically, we need to continue to attract and retain field application engineers to work with our direct sales force to technically qualify new sales opportunities and perform design work to demonstrate our products capabilities to customers during the benchmark evaluation process. Competition for qualified engineers is intense, particularly in Silicon Valley where our headquarters is located. Retaining our employees has become more challenging due to the decline in our stock price over the past several years. Many of the stock options held by our employees may have an exercise price that is significantly higher than the current trading price of our stock, and these underwater options do not serve their purpose as incentives for our employees to remain with Magma. Although, as discussed below, we have attempted to address this problem in part via a stock option exchange program that allowed eligible employees to exchange existing underwater options for options exercisable for a smaller number of shares at the price of $9.20 per share, we cannot guarantee that this program will satisfy our employees. In addition, the increased volatility of our stock price due to the pendency of, and developments in, the Synopsys litigation and above-referenced shareholder litigation may affect employee morale. Furthermore, in light of our adopting SFAS 123R Share-Based Payment in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2007, we will be changing our employee compensation practices, and those changes could make it harder for us to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates. If we lose the services of a significant number of our employees and/or if we cannot hire additional employees, we will be unable to increase our sales or implement or maintain our growth strategy. Our success is highly dependent on the technical, sales, marketing and managerial contributions of key individuals, and we may be unable to recruit and retain these personnel. We depend on our senior executives and certain key research and development and sales and marketing personnel, who are critical to our business. We do not have long-term employment agreements with our key employees, and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. Furthermore, our larger competitors may be able to offer more generous compensation packages to executives and key employees, and therefore we risk losing key personnel to those competitors. If we lose the services of any of our key personnel, our product development processes and sales efforts could be slowed. We may also incur increased operating expenses and be required to divert the attention of our senior executives to search for their replacements. The integration of our new executives or any new personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations. Customer payment defaults may cause us to be unable to recognize revenue from backlog, and changes in the type of orders comprising backlog could affect the proportion of revenue recognized from backlog each quarter, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and on investor expectations. A portion of our revenue backlog is variable based on volume of usage of our products by the customers or includes specific future deliverables or is recognized in revenue on a cash receipts basis. Management has 14 Table of Contents estimated variable usage based on customers forecasts, but there can be no assurance that these estimates will be realized. In addition, it is possible that customers from whom we expect to derive revenue from backlog will default and as a result we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog. If a customer defaults and fails to pay amounts owed, or if the level of defaults increases, our bad debt expense is likely to increase. Any material payment default by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle, and the large size of some orders, makes it difficult for us to forecast revenue and increases the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations, which could harm our stock price. Customers for our software products typically commit significant resources to evaluate available software. The complexity of our products requires us to spend substantial time and effort to assist potential customers in evaluating our software and in benchmarking it against our competition. As the complexity of the products we sell increases, we expect the sales cycle to lengthen. In addition, potential customers may be limited in their current spending by existing time-based licenses with their legacy vendors. In these cases, customers delay a significant new commitment to our software until the term of the existing license has expired. Also, because our products require a significant investment of time and cost by our customers, we must target those individuals within the customers organization who are able to make these decisions on behalf of their companies. These individuals tend to be senior management in an organization, typically at the vice president level. We may face difficulty identifying and establishing contact with such individuals. Even after initial acceptance, the negotiation and documentation processes can be lengthy. Our sales cycle typically ranges between three and nine months, but can be longer. Any delay in completing sales in a particular quarter could cause our operating results to fall below expectations. Furthermore, technological changes, litigation risk or other competitive factors could cause some customers to shorten the terms of deals significantly, and such shorter terms of deals could in turn have an impact on our total results for orders for this fiscal year. We rely on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and our revenue could decline due to delays of customer orders or the failure of existing customers to renew licenses or if we are unable to maintain or develop relationships with current or potential customers. Our business depends on sales to a small number of customers. In fiscal 2006, we had one customer that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue, and our top three customers together accounted for approximately 29% of our revenue. We expect that we will continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we fail to sell sufficient quantities of our products and services to one or more customers in any particular period, or if a large customer reduces purchases of our products or services, defers orders, or fails to renew licenses, our business and operating results could be harmed. Most of our customers license our software under time-based licensing agreements, with terms that typically vary from 15 months to 48 months. Most of our license agreements automatically expire at the end of the term unless the customer renews the license with us or purchases a perpetual license. If our customers do not renew their licenses, we may not be able to maintain our current revenue or may not generate additional revenue. Some of our license agreements allow customers to terminate an agreement prior to its expiration under limited circumstancesfor example, if our products do not meet specified performance requirements or goals. If these agreements are terminated prior to expiration or we are unable to collect under these agreements, our revenue may decline. Some contracts with extended payment terms provide for payments which are weighted toward the later part of the contract term. Accordingly, for bundled agreements, as the payment terms are extended, the revenue from these contracts is not recognized evenly over the contract term, but is recognized as the lesser of the cumulative amounts due and payable or ratably. For unbundled agreements, as the payment terms are extended, the revenue 15 Table of Contents from these contracts is recognized as amounts become due and payable. Revenue recognized under these arrangements will be higher in the later part of the contract term, which puts our revenue recognition in the future at greater risk of the customers continuing credit-worthiness. In addition, some of our customers have extended payment terms, which creates additional credit risk. We compete against companies that hold a large share of the electronic design automation market and competition is increasing among EDA vendors as customers tightly control their EDA spending and use fewer vendors to meet their needs. If we cannot compete successfully, we will not gain market share and our revenue could decline. We currently compete with companies that hold dominant shares in the electronic design automation market, such as Cadence and Synopsys. Each of these companies has a longer operating history and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do, as well as greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases. Our competitors are better able to offer aggressive discounts on their products, a practice they often employ. Competition and corresponding pricing pressures among EDA vendors or other factors might be causing or might cause in the future the overall market for EDA products to have low growth rates, remain relatively flat or even decrease in terms of overall dollars. Our competitors offer a more comprehensive range of products than we do; for example, we do not offer logic simulation, full-feature custom layout editing, analog or mixed signal implementation products, which can sometimes be an impediment to our winning a particular customer order. In addition, our industry has traditionally viewed acquisitions as an effective strategy for growth in products and market share and our competitors greater cash resources and higher market capitalization may give them a relative advantage over us in buying companies with promising new chip design products or companies that may be too large for us to acquire without a strain on our resources. Competition in the EDA Market has increased as customers rationalized their EDA spending by using products from fewer EDA vendors and continued consolidation in the electronic design automation market could intensify this trend. Also, many of our competitors, including Cadence and Synopsys, have established relationships with our current and potential customers and can devote substantial resources aimed at preventing us from establishing or enhancing our customer relationships. Competitive pressures may prevent us from obtaining new customers and gaining market share, may require us to reduce the price of products and services or cause us to lose existing customers, which could harm our business. To execute our business strategy successfully, we must continue our efforts to increase our sales worldwide. If we fail to do so in a timely manner or at all, we may not be able to gain market share and our business and operating results could suffer. Also, a variety of small companies continue to emerge, developing and introducing new products. Any of these companies could become a significant competitor in the future. We also compete with the internal chip design automation development groups of our existing and potential customers. Therefore, these customers may not require, or may be reluctant to purchase, products offered by independent vendors. Our competitors may develop or acquire new products or technologies that have the potential to replace our existing or new product offerings. The introduction of these new or additional products by competitors may cause potential customers to defer purchases of our products. If we fail to compete successfully, we will not gain market share and our business may fail. We may not be successful in integrating the operations of acquired companies and acquired technology. We expect to continuously evaluate the possibility of accelerating our growth through acquisitions, as is customary in the electronic design automation industry. Achieving the anticipated benefits of past and possible future acquisitions will depend in part upon whether we can integrate the operations, products and technology of acquired companies with our operations, products and technology in a timely and cost-effective manner. The process of integrating with acquired companies and acquired technology is complex, expensive and time consuming, and may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the product development and sales activities and operations of both companies. In addition, the earnout arrangements we use, and expect to continue 16 Table of Contents to use, to consummate some of our acquisitions, pursuant to which we agreed to pay additional amounts of contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue, bookings or product development milestones, can sometimes complicate integration efforts. We cannot be sure that any part or all of the integration will be accomplished on a timely basis, or at all. Assimilating previously acquired companies such as Silicon Metrics Corporation and Mojave, Inc., or any other companies we may seek to acquire in the future, involves a number of other risks, including, but not limited to:  adverse effects on existing customer relationships, such as cancellation of orders or the loss of key customers;  difficulties in integrating or an inability to retain key employees of the acquired company;  the risk that earnouts based on revenue will prove difficult to administer due to the complexities of revenue recognition accounting;  the risk that actions incentivized by earnout provisions will ultimately prove not to be in Magmas best interest as its interests may change over time;  difficulties in integrating the operations of the acquired company, such as information technology resources, manufacturing processes, and financial and operational data;  difficulties in integrating the technologies of the acquired company into our products;  diversion of management attention;  potential incompatibility of business cultures;  potential dilution to existing stockholders if we have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions; and  additional expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets. Our operating results may be harmed if our customers do not adopt, or are slow to adopt, 65-nanometer design geometries. Many Magma customers are currently working on 90-nanometer designs. Magma continues to work toward developing and enhancing its product line in anticipation of increased customer demand for 65-nanometer (sub-90 nanometer) design geometries. Similarly, Magma has acquired Mojave personnel and technology to better address customers needs for designing and verifying semiconductors that are manufacturable with higher yield and performance, which is a key design parameter when moving to 65-nanometer geometries. Notwithstanding our efforts to support 65-nanometer geometries, customers may fail to adopt or may be slower to adopt 65-nanometer geometries and we may be unable to convince our customers to purchase our related software products. Accordingly, any revenues we receive from enhancements to our products or acquired technologies may be less than the development or acquisition costs. If customers fail to adopt 65-nanometer design geometries or are slow to adopt 65-nanometer design geometries, our operating results may be harmed. In addition, if customers are not able successfully to make profits as they adopt smaller geometries, demand for our products may be adversely affected, and our operating results may be harmed. Our operating results will be harmed if chip designers do not adopt Blast Fusion, Talus or products released under our Cobra initiative or our other current and future products. Blast Fusion has accounted for a significant majority of our revenue since our inception and we believe that revenue from Blast Fusion, Talus and related products will account for most of our revenue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we have dedicated significant resources to developing and marketing Talus and products developed under our Cobra development initiative. We must gain market penetration of Blast Fusion, Talus and products released under our Cobra initiative in order to achieve our growth strategy and financial success. Moreover, if integrated circuit designers do not continue to adopt Blast Fusion or do not adopt Talus, our operating results will be significantly harmed. Furthermore, if there is a delay in the development or commercialization of Talus, our operating results may be significantly harmed. 17 Table of Contents We recently changed our organizational structure, and if this organizational structure does not successfully lead to effective interoperability between our products or effective collaboration among the applicable employees, then our operating results may be harmed. We recently changed our organizational structure such that we now have major business units that are responsible for our various products. If this organizational structure does not successfully lead to effective interoperability between our products or effective collaboration among the applicable employees, then our operating results may be harmed. For example, if this organizational structure is not successful, we could experience delays in new product development that could cause us to lose customer orders, which could harm our operating results. If the industries into which we sell our products experience recession or other cyclical effects affecting our customers research and development budgets, our revenue would be likely to decline. Demand for our products is driven by new integrated circuit design projects. The demand from semiconductor and systems companies is uncertain and difficult to predict. Slower growth in the semiconductor and systems industries, a reduced number of design starts, reduction of electronic design automation budgets or continued consolidation among our customers would harm our business and financial condition. The primary customers for our products are companies in the communications, computing, consumer electronics, networking and semiconductor industries. Any significant downturn in our customers markets or in general economic conditions that results in the cutback of research and development budgets or the delay of software purchases would likely result in lower demand for our products and services and could harm our business. For example, the United States economy, including the semiconductor industry, experienced a slowdown starting in 2000, which negatively impacted and may continue to impact our business and operating results. While the semiconductor industry experienced a moderate recovery in recent years, our customers have remained cautious, and it is not yet clear when increased R&D spending will occur. The continuing threat of terrorist attacks in the United States, the ongoing events in Iraq and other worldwide events including those in the Middle East have increased uncertainty in the United States economy. If the economy declines as a result of this economic, political and social turmoil, existing customers may delay their implementation of our software products and prospective customers may decide not to adopt our software products, either of which could negatively impact our business and operating results. The electronics industry has historically been subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in demand for its products, and this trend may continue in the future. These industry downturns have been, and may continue to be, characterized by diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent erosion of average selling prices. Difficulties in developing and achieving market acceptance of new products and delays in planned release dates of our software products and upgrades may harm our business. To succeed, we will need to develop innovative new products. We may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all required future innovations. Expanding into new technologies or extending our product line into areas we have not previously addressed may be more costly or difficult than anticipated. Also, any revenue that we receive from enhancements or new generations of our proprietary software products may be less than the costs of development. If we fail to develop and market new products in a timely manner or if new products do not meet performance features as marketed, our reputation and our business will suffer. Our costs of customer engagement and support are high, so our gross margin may decrease if we incur higher-than-expected costs associated with providing support services in the future or if we reduce our prices. Because of the complexity of our products, we typically incur high field application engineering support costs to engage new customers and assist them in their evaluations of our products. If we fail to manage our 18 Table of Contents customer engagement and support costs, our operating results could suffer. In addition, our gross margin may decrease if we are unable to manage support costs associated with the services revenue we generate or if we reduce prices in response to competitive pressure. Product defects could cause us to lose customers and revenue, or to incur unexpected expenses. Our products depend on complex software, both internally developed and acquired or licensed from third parties. Our customers may use our products with other companies products, which also contain complex software. If our software does not meet our customers performance requirements or meet the performance features as marketed, our customer relationships may suffer. Also, a limited number of our contracts include specified ongoing performance criteria. If our products fail to meet these criteria, it may lead to termination of these agreements and loss of future revenue. Complex software often contains errors. Any failure or poor performance of our software or the third-party software with which it is integrated could result in:  delayed market acceptance of our software products;  delays in product shipments;  unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to identify the source of errors or to correct errors;  damage to our reputation;  delayed or lost revenue; and  product liability claims. Our product functions are often critical to our customers, especially because of the resources our customers expend on the design and fabrication of integrated circuits. Many of our licensing agreements contain provisions to provide a limited warranty, which provides the customer with a right of refund for the license fees if we are unable to correct errors reported during the warranty period. If our contractual limitations are unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction or if we are exposed to claims that are not covered by insurance, a successful claim could harm our business. We currently carry insurance coverage and limits that we believe are consistent with similarly situated companies within the EDA industry. Much of our business is international, which exposes us to risks inherent to doing business internationally that could harm our business. We also intend to expand our international operations. If our revenue from this expansion does not exceed the expenses associated with this expansion, our business and operating results could suffer. We generated 33% of our total revenue from sales outside North America for fiscal 2006, compared to 43% for fiscal 2005 and 48% for fiscal 2004. While most of our international sales to date have been denominated in U.S. dollars, our international operating expenses have been denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies could increase the relative costs of our overseas operations, which could reduce our operating margins. The expansion of our international operations includes the maintenance of sales offices in Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific region. If our revenue from international operations does not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining our international operations, our business could suffer. Additional risks we face in conducting business internationally include:  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations across different geographic areas;  changes in currency exchange rates and controls;  uncertainty regarding tax and regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions;  the possible lack of financial and political stability in foreign countries, preventing overseas sales growth; 19 Table of Contents  on-going events in Iraq; and  the effects of terrorist attacks in the United States and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide. Future changes in accounting standards, specifically changes affecting revenue recognition, could cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations. Future changes in accounting standards or interpretations thereof, specifically those changes affecting software revenue recognition, could require us to change our methods of revenue recognition. These changes could result in deferral of revenue recognized in current periods to subsequent periods or in accelerated recognition of deferred revenue to current periods, each of which could cause shortfalls in meeting the expectations of investors and securities analysts. Our stock price could decline as a result of any shortfall. Implementation of internal controls reporting and attestation requirements, as further described below, will impose additional financial and administrative obligations on us and will cause us to incur substantial implementation costs from third party consultants, which could adversely affect our results. Changes in laws and regulations that affect the governance of public companies have increased our operating expenses and will continue to do so. Recently enacted changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the listing requirements for The Nasdaq Stock Market have imposed new duties on us and on our executives, directors, attorneys and independent registered public accounting firms. In order to comply with these new rules, we have hired additional personnel and use additional outside legal, accounting and advisory services, all of which have increased and may further increase our operating expenses over time. In particular, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional administrative expenses relating to the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires that we implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls and annual certification of our compliance by our independent auditor. For example, we have incurred significant expenses and will continue to incur expenses in connection with the implementation, documentation and continued testing of our internal control systems. Management time associated with these compliance efforts necessarily reduces time available for other operating activities, which could adversely affect operating results. For the years ended April 2, 2006 and March 31,2005, our independent registered public accounting firm certified that we were in compliance with the provision of Section 404 relating to effective internal control over financial reporting; however, our internal control obligations are ongoing and subject to continued review and testing. If we are unable to maintain full and timely compliance with these and other regulatory requirements, we could be required to incur additional costs, expend additional management time on remedial efforts and make related public disclosures that could adversely affect our stock price and result in securities litigation. The effectiveness of disclosure controls is inherently limited. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, or our internal control over financial reporting, will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system objectives will be met. The design of a control system must also reflect applicable resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. As a result of these inherent limitations, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Magma have been detected. Failure of the control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact our financial results and our business. Forecasting our tax rates is complex and subject to uncertainty. Our management must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance that may be recorded against our deferred tax assets. These assumptions, judgments and estimates are difficult to make due to their 20 Table of Contents complexity, and the relevant tax law is often changing. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following:  an increase in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, including deferred stock-based compensation and write-offs of acquired in-process research and development;  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;  future changes in ownership that may limit realization of certain assets;  changes in forecasts of pre-tax profits and losses by jurisdiction used to estimate tax expense by jurisdiction;  assessment of additional taxes as a result of federal, state, or foreign tax examinations; or  changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws. Our success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology standards of the semiconductor industry; if we are unable to keep pace, our products could be rendered obsolete, which would cause our operating results to decline. The semiconductor industry has made significant technological advances. In particular, recent advances in deep sub-micron technology have required electronic design automation companies to continuously develop or acquire new products and enhance existing products. The evolving nature of our industry could render our existing products and services obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to:  enhance our existing products and services;  develop and introduce new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis that will keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards;  address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers; and  acquire other companies that have complementary or innovative products. If we are unable, for technical, legal, financial or other reasons, to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. If we fail to offer and maintain competitive stock option packages for our employees, or if our stock price declines materially for a protracted period of time, we might have difficulty retaining our employees and our business may be harmed. In todays competitive technology industry, employment decisions of highly skilled personnel are influenced by stock option packages, which offer incentives above traditional compensation only where there is a consistent, long-term upward trend over time of a companys stock price. Our stock price has declined significantly over the past several years due to market conditions and has recently been negatively affected by uncertainty surrounding the outcome of our patent litigation with Synopsys, Inc. (discussed below under Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings). On June 22, 2005, our stockholders approved a stock option exchange program (Exchange Program) allowing non-executive employees holding options to purchase our common stock at exercise prices greater than or equal to $10.50 to exchange those options for a smaller number of new options at an exercise price equal to fair market value on the date of grant. Magma implemented this Exchange Program, and the date of grant was August 22, 2005, at which date the closing trading price of our stock was $9.20 per share. Therefore, the exercise price for new options under this Exchange Program is $9.20 per share. If this exercise price of $9.20 per share or the terms of the Exchange Program are not satisfactory to employees who participate in the Exchange Program, or, if our stock price remains below the grant price of $9.20, our ability to retain employees could be affected. 21 Table of Contents Many of the options held by our non-executive employees, including options issued in the Exchange Program, have an exercise price significantly above the current trading price of our stock; on April 2, 2006 approximately 78% of the options held by our non-executive employees were underwater. If our stock price continues to decline in the future due to market conditions, investors perceptions of the technology industry or managerial or performance problems we have, we may be forced to grant additional options to retain employees. This in turn could result in:  immediate and substantial dilution to investors resulting from the grant of additional options necessary to retain employees; and  compensation charges against the us, which would negatively impact our operating results. In addition, the new accounting requirements for employee stock options discussed below may adversely affect our option grant practices and our ability to recruit and retain employees. Due to changes in the accounting treatment for employee stock options, we are changing our employee compensation practices, and our reported results of operations will likely be adversely affected. As of April 2, 2006, we accounted for the issuance of employee stock options under principles that do not require us to record compensation expense for options granted at fair market value. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment, which eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB 25, and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value based method. Under SFAS 123R, companies are required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share-based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans. We are required to adopt the new rules in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2007. This change in accounting treatment will result in significant additional compensation expense compared to prior periods and will likely adversely affect our reported results of operations and hinder our ability to achieve profitability. We are continuing to assess the full impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R on our business practices and, as part of that assessment, are changing our employee compensation practices. These changes could make it harder for us to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates. If our sales force compensation arrangements are not designed effectively, we may lose sales personnel and resources. Designing an effective incentive compensation structure for our sales force is critical to our success. We have experimented, and continue to experiment, with different systems of sales force compensation. If our incentives are not well designed, we may experience reduced revenue generation, and we may also lose the services of our more productive sales personnel, either of which would reduce our revenue or potential revenue. Fluctuations in our growth place a strain on our management systems and resources, and if we fail to manage the pace of our growth, our business could be harmed. Periods of growth followed by efforts to realign costs when revenue growth is slower than anticipated have placed a strain on our management, administrative and financial resources. For example, in fiscal year 2005 we decreased our workforce by 23 employees. Over time we have significantly expanded our operations in the United States and internationally, and we plan to continue to expand the geographic scope of our operations. To pace the growth of our operations with the growth in our revenue, we must continue to improve administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls. Failure to improve our internal procedures and controls could hinder our efforts to adequately manage our growth, disrupt operations, lead to deficiencies in our internal controls and financial reporting and ultimately harm our business. 22 Table of Contents If chip designers and manufacturers do not integrate our software into existing design flows, or if other software companies do not cooperate in working with us to interface our products with their design flows, demand for our products may decrease. To implement our business strategy successfully, we must provide products that interface with the software of other electronic design automation software companies. Our competitors may not support our or our customers efforts to integrate our products into their existing design flows. We must develop cooperative relationships with competitors so that they will work with us to integrate our software into customers design flow. Currently, our software is designed to interface with the existing software of Cadence, Synopsys and others. If we are unable to convince customers to adopt our software products instead of those of competitors offering a broader set of products, or if we are unable to convince other software companies to work with us to interface our software with theirs to meet the demands of chip designers and manufacturers, our business and operating results will suffer. We may not obtain sufficient patent protection, which could harm our competitive position and increase our expenses. Our success and ability to compete depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology. We currently have a number of issued patents in the United States, but this number is relatively few in relation to our competitors. These legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology. In addition, rights that may be granted under any patent application that may issue in the future may not provide competitive advantages to us. Further, patent protection in foreign jurisdictions where we may need this protection may be limited or unavailable. It is possible that:  our pending U.S. and non-U.S. patents may not be issued;  competitors may design around our present or future issued patents or may develop competing non-infringing technologies;  present and future issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary rights; and  present and future issued patents could be successfully challenged for validity and enforceability. We believe the patent portfolios of our competitors are far larger than ours, and this may increase the risk that they may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross-licenses. We rely on trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, and if these rights are not sufficiently protected, it could harm our ability to compete and generate income. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses. Our ability to compete and grow our business could suffer if these rights are not adequately protected. We seek to protect our source code for our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. We license our software pursuant to agreements, which impose certain restrictions on the licensees ability to utilize the software. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements. Our proprietary rights may not be adequately protected because:  laws and contractual restrictions in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies;  competitors may independently develop similar technologies and software; 23 Table of Contents  for some of our trademarks, federal U.S. trademark protection may be unavailable to us;  our trademarks might not be protected or protectable in some foreign jurisdictions;  the validity and scope of our U.S. and foreign trademarks could be successfully challenged; and  policing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and we may be unable to determine the extent of this unauthorized use. The laws of some countries in which we market our products may offer little or no protection of our proprietary technologies. Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without paying us for it, which would harm our competitive position and market share. Our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders own a substantial portion of our common stock and this concentration of ownership may allow them to elect most of our directors and could delay or prevent a change in control of Magma. Our directors, executive officers and stockholders who currently own over 5% of our common stock beneficially own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, in a combined vote, will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, they may be able to elect most of our directors, delay or prevent a transaction in which stockholders might receive a premium over the market price for their shares or prevent changes in control or management. We may need additional capital in the future, but there is no assurance that funds would be available on acceptable terms. In the future we may need to raise additional capital in order to achieve growth or other business objectives. This financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing stockholders. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to expand, develop or enhance services or products, or respond to competitive pressures would be limited. Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware corporate law contain anti-takeover provisions which could delay or prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. We could also adopt a stockholder rights plan, which could also delay or prevent a change in control. Delaware law, as well as our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if the change of control would be beneficial to the stockholders. These provisions could lower the price that future investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. These anti-takeover provisions:  authorize the Board of Directors without prior stockholder approval to create and issue preferred stock that can be issued increasing the number of outstanding shares and deter or prevent a takeover attempt;  prohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;  establish a classified Board of Directors requiring that not all members of the board be elected at one time;  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;  limit the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and  require advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors and proposals that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. 24 Table of Contents In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the terms of our stock option plans may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. That section generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for three years after the date the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Also, our stock option plans include change-in-control provisions that allow us to grant options or stock purchase rights that will become vested immediately upon a change in control of us. The board of directors also has the power to adopt a stockholder rights plan, which could delay or prevent a change in control even if the change in control appeared to be beneficial to stockholders. These plans, sometimes called poison pills, are sometimes criticized by institutional investors or their advisors and could affect our rating by such investors or advisors. If the board were to adopt such a plan it might have the effect of reducing the price that new investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock. We are subject to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We transact some portions of our business in various foreign currencies. Accordingly, we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure is primarily related to operating expenses in the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan, which are denominated in the respective local currencies. As of April 2, 2006, we had no hedging contracts outstanding. We do not currently use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses denominated in Euro, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis. The convertible notes we issued in May 2003 are debt obligations that must be repaid in cash in May 2008 if they are not converted into our common stock at an earlier date, which is unlikely to occur if the price of our common stock does not exceed the conversion price. In May 2003, we issued $150.0 million principal amount of zero coupon convertible notes due May 2008. In May 2005, we repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, $44.5 million face amount (or approximately 29.7 percent of the total) of these notes at an average discount to face value of approximately 22 percent. In addition, in May 2006, we repurchased another $40.3 million face amount (approximately 38.2 percent of the remaining principal) of these notes at an average discount to face value of approximately 13 percent. Magma spent an aggregate of approximately $34.8 million and $35.0 million, respectively, on the repurchases in May 2005 and May 2006. The repurchases leave approximately $65.2 million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes outstanding. We will be required to repay that principal amount in full in May 2008 unless the holders of those notes elect to convert them into our common stock before the repayment date. The conversion price of the notes is $22.86 per share. If the price of our common stock does not rise above that level, conversion of the notes is unlikely and we would be required to repay the principal amount of the notes in cash. There have been previous quarters in which we have experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors, which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Because the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, volatility or depressed prices for our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of the notes. Hedging transactions and other transactions may affect the value of our common stock and our convertible notes. We entered into hedging arrangements with Credit Suisse First Boston International at the time we issued our convertible notes, with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing common stock upon conversion of the notes. At the time of our May 2005 and May 2006 repurchases of our zero coupon convertible notes, portions of the hedging arrangements were retired. These hedging arrangements are likely to have caused 25 Table of Contents Credit Suisse First Boston International and others to take positions in our common stock in secondary market transactions or to enter into derivative transactions at or after the sale of the notes. Any market participants entering into hedging arrangements are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or other securities, which may increase the volatility and reduce the market price of our common stock. We may be unable to meet the requirements under the indenture to purchase our convertible notes upon a change in control. Upon a change in control, which is defined in the indenture to include some cash acquisitions and private company mergers, note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes they hold. If a change in control were to occur, we might not have enough funds to pay the purchase price for all tendered notes. Future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness might prohibit the redemption or repurchase of the notes and provide that a change in control constitutes an event of default. If a change in control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing the notes, we could seek the consent of our lenders to purchase the notes or could attempt to refinance this debt. If we do not obtain a consent, we could not purchase the notes. Our failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture, which might constitute a default under the terms of our other debt. In such circumstances, or if a change in control would constitute an event of default under our senior indebtedness, the subordination provisions of the indenture would possibly limit or prohibit payments to note holders. Our obligation to offer to purchase the notes upon a change in control would not necessarily afford note holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, merger or similar transaction involving us. Failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by preventing us from transferring our technology outside of the United States. We are required to comply with U.S. Department of Commerce regulations when shipping our software products and/or transferring our technology outside of the United States or to certain foreign nationals. We believe we have complied with applicable export regulations, however, these regulations are subject to change, and, future difficulties in obtaining export licenses for current, future developed and acquired products and technology could harm our business, financial conditions and operating results. Our business operations may be adversely affected in the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster. Our corporate headquarters and much of our research and development operations are located in Silicon Valley, California, which is an area known for its seismic activity. An earthquake, fire or other significant natural disaster could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and/or operating results. ITEM 1B.
