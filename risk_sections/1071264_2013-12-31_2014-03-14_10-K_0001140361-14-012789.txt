ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED) A Florida state-chartered commercial bank may not pay cash dividends that would cause the bankâ€™s capital to fall below the minimum amount required by federal or state law. Accordingly, commercial banks may only pay dividends out of the total of current net profits plus retained net profits of the preceding two years to the extent it deems expedient, except as follows: No bank may pay a dividend at any time that the total of net income for the current year, when combined with retained net income from the preceding two years, produces a loss. The Bank met this restriction in 2013 as our net income for the year combined with retained earnings from the preceding two years produced a loss. The future ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Bancorp will also depend in part on the FDIC capital requirements in effect at such time and our ability to comply with such requirements. ITEM 1B.
