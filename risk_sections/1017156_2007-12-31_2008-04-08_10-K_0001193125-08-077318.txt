ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Forward-Looking Information You should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes. Risk factors that may affect future results and financial condition We have recently defaulted on a material portion of our debt obligations. As a result, our lenders may foreclose on our assets and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. On June 12, 2007, we entered into a Forbearance Agreement with our Class 4 Creditor Trust in response to our default under our obligations to these creditors. Under the Forbearance Agreement, we were required to contract for the sale of assets or secure financing in the following amounts: (i) $2 million by June 30, 2007, (ii) an additional $1 million by August 31, 2007, (iii) an additional $1 million by September 30, 2007 and (iv) an additional $1 million by October 31, 2007, with the balance due by November 15, 2007. The approximate aggregate amount of payments under the agreement, including interest, penalties and fees, is currently approximately $4.8 million. In order to facilitate these payments, we have sold our Williamsburg, Virginia restaurant for $1.2 million, our Cliffhouse and Troy restaurants are under contract to be sold for $0.6 million and $0.18 million, respectively. Also, we are seeking to sell additional properties. We cannot assure you that these sales will be completed. At each benchmark date, we provided the Creditors Trust contracts to satisfy our obligations under the Forbearance Agreement. However, not all transactions under contract were consummated and we have remaining obligations to the Class 4 Creditor Trust. There is no guarantee that we will satisfy our obligations to the Class 4 Creditor Trust. If we fail to meet our obligations under the Forbearance Agreement, the Class 4 Creditor Trust may foreclose on our assets, which would likely result in our inability to continue as a going concern. In such event, you likely would lose the entire amount of your investment in us. - 9 - Our independent registered public accounting firm issued a going concern opinion on our financial statements, questioning our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firms opinion on our 2007 financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph indicating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Since our inception, we have operated with limited operating capital, and we continue to face immediate and substantial cash needs. We have limited cash resources and will need to raise additional capital through public or private financings or other arrangements in order to meet current commitments and continue development of our business. We cannot assure you that additional capital will be available to us when needed, if at all, or, if available, will be obtained on terms attractive to us. Failure to raise additional capital when needed could cause us to cease our operations. Our prior bankruptcy could hinder our ability to negotiate effectively with third parties and could adversely affect our operations going forward. In February 2002, we and Paragon (our only wholly owned subsidiary) filed for voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. We officially emerged from bankruptcy on December 31, 2003. However, our Chapter 11 reorganization and financial condition and performance could adversely affect our operations going forward. Our bankruptcy filings had an adverse affect on our credit standing with our lenders, certain suppliers and other trade creditors. This can increase our costs of doing business and can hinder our negotiating power with our lenders, certain suppliers and other trade creditors. The failure to negotiate favorable terms could adversely affect our financial performance. If we are unable to obtain additional funds in the immediate future, we may have to curtail or suspend all of our operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We need additional financing to fund our operations. If we are unable to obtain additional funds in a timely manner or on acceptable terms to fund our operations, it will seriously affect our ability to meet the objectives of our Plan, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern. Our ability to obtain financing will depend, in part, on factors beyond our control, such as the status of various debt and equity markets. In particular, currently tight lending conditions in the U.S. credit markets may make it more time consuming and expensive for us to obtain financing, if we can obtain financing at all. We do not have sufficient cash reserves to maintain and fund our operations and fund our obligations. We do not have sufficient cash reserves to maintain our operations and fund our obligations, including, without limitation, our obligations under the Forbearance Agreement. We may need to seek additional financing. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our plan of reorganization and may be required to sell core assets or dissolve the business and we may not be able to continue as a going concern. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock. If we issue or incur debt to raise funds, we may be subject to limitations on our operations. - 10 - We have incurred losses from inception and may never generate substantial profits. We were organized in May 1996 and have incurred significant losses since inception. We may never generate profits. We incurred net losses in the following approximate amounts: $5.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006; $0.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005; $0.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004; and $4.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. If we do not achieve and maintain profitability, we will be unable to continue our operations and you may lose the value of your entire investment in our common stock. We will need additional capital for expansion. The development of new restaurants requires funds for construction, tenant improvements, furniture, fixtures, equipment, training of employees, permits, initial franchise fees, and other expenditures. We will require funds to develop additional restaurants and to pursue any additional restaurant development or restaurant acquisition opportunities that may develop. In the future, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide funds so that we can develop or acquire additional restaurants. Such financing may not be available or may not be available on satisfactory terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand our restaurant operations. While debt financing will enable us to add more restaurants than we would otherwise be able to add, debt financing increases expenses and is limited as to availability due to our financial results and bankruptcy history, and we must repay the debt regardless of our operating results. Future equity financings could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we lose or are unable to obtain key personnel, our ability to effectively operate our business could be hindered. Our ability to maintain or enhance our competitive position will depend to a significant extent on the efforts and ability of our executive officers, particularly our chief executive officer. Our future success and our ability to manage future growth will depend in large part upon the efforts of our management team and on our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel. Competition for personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining our personnel. Our inability to retain our current management team and attract and retain other highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations and hinder our ability to effectively manage our business. Changing consumer preferences and discretionary spending patterns, potential outbreaks of mad cow disease or foot/mouth disease and other factors affecting the availability of beef could force us to modify our restaurants concept and menu and could result in a reduction in our revenues. Even if we are able to successfully compete with other restaurant companies with similar concepts, we may be forced to make changes in one or more of our concepts in order to respond to changes in consumer tastes or dining patterns. Consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of beef, the primary item on our Hungry Hunter, Hunter Steakhouse, Mountain Jacks and Carvers restaurants menus, or by specific events such as the recently confirmed cases of mad cow disease by the Canadian government in August 2006, the recent recall by a California meat company of 143 million pounds of beef or foot/mouth disease outbreak which occurred in the United Kingdom in 2001. In addition, these events could reduce the available supply of beef or significantly raise the price of beef. If we were to modify the emphasis on beef on our restaurants menus, we may lose additional customers who do not prefer the new concept and menu, and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to generate the necessary revenues needed to make our restaurants profitable. In addition, we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a concept change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors. Our success also depends on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending, including economic conditions, the cost of gasoline, disposable consumer income and consumer confidence. Adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing, either of which could reduce revenues and operating income. - 11 - We face risks associated with changes in general economic conditions that affect consumer spending. The uncertainty surrounding the U.S. economy may cause our customers to reduce their level of discretionary spending. We believe that a decrease in discretionary spending would impact the frequency with which our customers choose to dine out or the amount they spend on meals while dining out, thereby decreasing our revenues. Adverse economic conditions and any related decrease in discretionary spending by our customers would have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results. Our profitability is dependent in large measure on food and supply costs which are not within our control. Our profitability is dependent in large measure on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. Various factors beyond our control, including climatic changes and government regulations and recalls, may affect food costs. Specifically, our dependence on frequent, timely deliveries of fresh beef, poultry, seafood and produce subjects us to the risks of possible shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions, which could adversely affect the availability and cost of any such items. We cannot assure you that we will be able to anticipate or react to increasing food and supply costs in the future. The failure to react to these increases could materially and adversely affect our business and result of operations. Our ability to execute our expansion plans depends on securing suitable locations at favorable prices. Our strategy for expansion of our operations includes the construction of new restaurant properties and/or the acquisition of existing properties. Our ability to open additional restaurants will depend upon our ability to identify and acquire available new construction sites or restaurant conversions at favorable prices. We must also have sufficient available funds from operations or otherwise to support this expansion. If we cannot successfully construct new restaurant properties or convert acquired restaurant properties to our established brands within projected budgets or time periods, our business and our ability to continue as a going concern will be adversely affected. Even with the success of the Plan and sufficient funds, plans to expand our business may fail due to construction delays or cost overruns, which could be caused by numerous factors, such as shortages of materials and skilled labor, labor disputes, weather interference, environmental problems and construction or zoning problems. We face risks associated with the expansion of our operations. The success of our business depends on our ability to expand our number of restaurants, either by developing or acquiring additional restaurants. Our success also depends on our ability to operate and manage successfully our growing operations. Our ability to expand successfully will depend upon a number of factors, including the following:  the availability and cost of suitable restaurant locations for development;  the availability of restaurant acquisition opportunities;  the hiring, training, and retention of additional management and restaurant personnel;  the availability of adequate financing;  the continued development and implementation of management information systems;  competitive factors; and  general economic and business conditions. Increased construction costs and delays resulting from governmental regulatory approvals, strikes, or work stoppages, adverse weather conditions, and various acts of God may also affect the opening of new restaurants. Newly opened restaurants may operate at a loss for a period following their initial opening. The length of this period will depend upon a number of factors, including the time of the year the restaurant is opened, the sales volume, and our ability to control costs. - 12 - We may not successfully achieve our expansion goals. Additional restaurants that we develop or acquire may not be profitable. In addition, the opening of additional restaurants in an existing market may have the effect of drawing customers from and reducing the sales volume of our existing restaurants in those markets. Successful mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions are important to our future growth and profitability. We intend to evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint venture investments, and divestitures as part of our strategic planning initiative, including our potential acquisition of seven steakhouses in New England. These transactions involve various inherent risks, including, among other things,  our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, including assessing the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of any acquisition candidate;  our ability to negotiate favorable acquisition terms for such targets;  our ability to prevail over competing bidders for any acquisition candidate;  our ability to secure financing necessary to complete such acquisitions in a timely manner and on acceptable terms;  our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies from any acquired business;  unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting any acquired business;  our ability to complete divestitures on acceptable terms and at or near the prices estimated as attainable by us; and  our ability to integrate successfully the operations and management of any business we acquire into our business. Given that our growth strategy is heavily dependent on acquiring new businesses, if we are unable to execute on this strategy for any reason our future operating results may be harmed materially. We depend on key food product distributors. We have a major meat vendor that accounted for approximately $4.6 million (13%) and $5.0 million (11%) of our total purchases in 2007 and 2006 respectively. We purchase our food and beverage products from a number of food distributors, including Southwest Traders on the West Coast and U.S. Foodservice in the Midwest. If any of our vendors is unable to continue dependably providing us with high quality supplies, at volume discounted prices, our business could be harmed. We believe that all essential products are available from other national suppliers as well as from local suppliers in the cities in which our restaurants are located in the event that we must purchase our products from other suppliers; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to match quality, price or dependability of supply. We face commodity price and availability risk. We purchase energy and agricultural products that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions and other factors that are not predictable or within our control. Increases in commodity prices could result in lower restaurant-level operating margins for our restaurant concepts. Occasionally, the availability of commodities can be limited due to circumstances beyond our control. If we are unable to obtain such commodities, we may be unable to offer related products, which would have a negative impact on our profitability. - 13 - Increases in federal and state statutory minimum wages will increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The recent increases in the state statutory minimum wage and the federal minimum wage increases will raise minimum wages above the current wages of some of our employees. As a result, competitive factors could require us to make corresponding increases in our employees wages. Increases in our wage rates increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The failure to enforce and maintain our trademarks and trade names could adversely affect our ability to establish and maintain brand awareness. Our current operations and marketing strategy depend significantly on the strength of trademarks and service marks. Our Subsidiarys wholly owned subsidiary, Paragon of Michigan, Inc., has registered, among others, the names Hungry Hunter, Mountain Jacks and Carvers. The success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products. Although we are not aware of any infringing uses of any of our trademarks or service marks that we believe could materially affect us; we cannot assure you that we will be free from such infringements in the future. The names Hungry Hunter, Mountain Jacks and Carvers represent our core concept restaurants. The termination of our right to use these names or our failure to maintain any of our other existing trademarks could materially and adversely affect our growth and marketing strategies. Because we maintain a small number of restaurants, the negative performance of a single restaurant could have a substantial impact on our operating results. We currently own and operate 23 restaurants. Due to this relatively small number of restaurants, poor financial performance at any one restaurant could have a significant negative impact on our profitability as a whole. The results achieved to date by our relatively small restaurant base may not be indicative of the results of a larger number of restaurants in a broader geographic area with varied demographic characteristics. We cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our existing restaurants at higher sales levels that generate equal or higher operating profits or increase the number of our restaurants sufficiently to offset the impact of poor performance at any one restaurant. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to seasonality and other factors beyond our control. Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which may vary greatly depending upon the region of the United States in which a particular restaurant is located. In addition to seasonality, our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable unit sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including:  the amount of sales contributed by new and existing restaurants;  the timing of new openings;  increases in the cost of key food or beverage products;  labor costs for our personnel;  our ability to achieve and sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis;  consumer confidence and changes in consumer preferences;  health concerns, including adverse publicity concerning food-related illness;  the level of competition from existing or new competitors in our segment of the restaurant industry; and  economic conditions generally and in each of the markets in which we are located. - 14 - These fluctuations make it difficult for us to predict and address in a timely manner factors that may have a negative impact on our results of operations. We could face labor shortages, increased labor costs and other adverse effects of varying labor conditions. The development and success of our restaurants depend, in large part, on the efforts, abilities, experience and reputations of the general managers and chefs at such restaurants. In addition, our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including restaurant managers, kitchen staff and wait staff. Qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply and the inability to recruit and retain such individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants. A significant delay in finding qualified employees or high turnover of existing employees could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or business. Also, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract sufficient qualified employees, which could result in higher, labor costs. In addition, increases in the minimum hourly wage, employment tax rates and levies, related benefits costs, including health insurance, and similar matters over which we have no control may increase our operating costs. Further, the United States Congress is considering changes to Federal immigration laws. Changes to these laws may adversely affect our operations by increasing our compliance and oversight obligations and making it more expensive and difficult for us to hire qualified employees. The restaurant industry is affected by litigation and publicity concerning food quality, health and other issues, which can cause guests to avoid our restaurants and result in liabilities. Health concerns, including adverse publicity concerning food-related illness such as the recent recall by a California meat company of 143 million pounds of beef, although not specifically related to our restaurants, could cause guests to avoid our restaurants, which would have a negative impact on our sales. We may also be the subject of complaints or litigation from guests alleging food-related illness, injuries suffered at our restaurants or other food quality, health or operational concerns. A lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We may also be subject to litigation, which, regardless of the outcome, could result in adverse publicity. Adverse publicity resulting from such allegations or related litigation may interfere with our managements ability to focus on operating our restaurants, result in reduced business at our restaurants, harm our reputation, and generally have a negative impact on our business and operations, regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable. Compliance with environmental laws may affect our financial condition. We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws. These laws govern discharges to air and water, as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes. These laws may also impose liability for damages from and the costs of cleaning up sites of spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous materials. We may be responsible for environmental conditions or contamination relating to our restaurants and the land on which our restaurants are located, regardless of whether we lease or own the restaurant or land in question and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by us or by a prior owner or tenant. The costs of any cleanup could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We face increased expenditures of time and money associated with compliance with changing regulations of corporate governance and public disclosure. Keeping abreast of, and in compliance with, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and new SEC regulations, has required an increased amount of management attention and external resources. We remain committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. - 15 - In the event we are unable to remedy any deficiency we identify in our system of internal controls over financial reporting, or if our internal controls are not effective, our business and our stock price could suffer. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, management is required to assess the adequacy of our internal controls, remediate any deficiency that may be identified, validate that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal controls. As part of this continuous process, we may discover deficiencies that require us to improve our procedures, processes and systems in order to ensure that our internal controls are adequate and effective and that we are in compliance with the requirements of Section 404. If any deficiency we may find from time to time is not adequately addressed, or if we are unable to complete all of our testing and any remediation in time for compliance with the requirements of Section 404 and the SEC rules there under, we would be unable to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which could adversely affect investor confidence in our internal controls over financial reporting. Risks Related To Our Common Stock Since our shares are thinly traded, and trading on the OTC Bulletin Board may be sporadic because it is not an exchange, stockholders may have difficulty reselling their shares. Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. The fact that our common stock is not listed on a major exchange is likely to make trading more difficult for broker-dealers, stockholders and investors, potentially leading to further declines in share price. An investor may find it more difficult to sell our common stock or to obtain accurate quotations of the share price of our common stock. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of other companies, trading volume in our common stock, dilution resulting from future financings, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted. Such litigation, if initiated, could result in substantial costs, a material adverse effect on our business, and a diversion of managements attention and resources. Failure of our common stock to appreciate in value could affect our ability to raise working capital and adversely impact our ability to continue our normal operations. A prolonged period in which our common stock trades at current levels could result in our inability to raise capital and may force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses, which would have a significant negative effect on our business plans and operations. If our stock price does not recover from its current levels, there can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the future, we may not have the resources to continue our normal operations. - 16 - The large number of shares of our common stock eligible for public sale and the fact that a relatively small number of investors hold our publicly traded common stock could cause our stock price to fluctuate. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate as a result of sales by our existing stockholders of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. A large number of shares of our stock are eligible for public sale and our common stock is concentrated in the hands of a small number of investors and is thinly traded. An attempt to sell by a large holder could adversely affect the price of our common stock. These sales or the perception that these sales might occur could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SECs penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5.0 million or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1.0 million or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for penny stock. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. NASD sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock. In addition to the penny stock rules described above, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the NASD) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, the NASD believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The NASD requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. Delaware law contains anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable. Because we are a Delaware corporation, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or Delaware Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future, resulting in the market price being lower than it might be without these provisions. - 17 - Approximately 38% of our outstanding common stock is held by five stockholders, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters. A substantial portion of our capital stock is held by a limited number of stockholders. Five stockholders, including our officers and directors and parties affiliated with or related to such persons or to us, own approximately 38% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Accordingly, such stockholders will likely have a strong influence on major decisions of corporate policy, and the outcome of any major transaction or other matters submitted to our stockholders or board of directors, including potential mergers or acquisitions, and amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Stockholders other than these principal stockholders are therefore likely to have little influence on decisions regarding such matters. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. None.
