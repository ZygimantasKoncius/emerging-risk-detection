Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following are certain risk factors that affect the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, some of which are beyond the Companys control. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. If any of the events described below were to actually occur, the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected and results could differ materially from expected and historical results. A decline in the demand for luxury goods due to difficult macroeconomic conditions has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on the Companys results of operations. The Company is focused on the luxury retail sector. SFA stores, OFF 5TH stores and www.saks.com offer a wide assortment of luxury fashion apparel, shoes, accessories, jewelry, cosmetics, and gift items. All of the goods that the Company sells are discretionary items. Changes in consumer confidence and fluctuations in financial markets can influence cyclical trends, particularly in the luxury sector. Consequently, starting in the fall of 2008, the downturn in the economy resulted and may continue to result in fewer customers shopping in the Companys stores. In response, and in order to reduce inventory levels, the Company was required to take additional markdowns and to increase promotional events during Fall of 2008 and Spring of 2009. The increased markdowns and promotional activity negatively impacted the Companys profitability. Any future unexpected significant decrease in demand could have a similar effect on profit. As a result of a decrease in consumer spending, the Company has been forced to reduce costs. Despite these measures and continued efforts to align inventory levels with expected sales in fiscal year 2010, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in restoring profitability. In addition, in the event that we are unsuccessful in restoring profitability, we may not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets, which would require us to record a valuation allowance that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded. Poor economic conditions have affected and may continue to affect consumer spending which has harmed and may continue to harm the Companys business. The retail industry is continuously subject to domestic and international economic trends. The success of the Companys business depends to a significant extent upon the level of consumer spending. A number of factors affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise that the Company offers, including, among other things:  general economic, industry, and weather conditions; 7 Table of Contents  the performance of the financial equity, and credit markets;  current and expected unemployment levels;  crude oil prices that affect gasoline and heating oil prices;  the level of consumer debt;  the level of consumer savings  interest rates;  tax rates and policies;  consumer confidence in future economic conditions; and  war, terrorism, and other hostilities. Reduced consumer confidence and spending has resulted in reduced demand for discretionary items and has forced the Company to take significant markdowns in the past. If consumer demand for the Companys merchandise remains weak, the Company may be forced to take additional markdowns in future periods. Additionally, several of the Companys stores are in tourist markets, including the flagship SFA New York store. A continuation of the downturn in economic conditions or other events such as terrorist activity could further impact travel and thus negatively affect the results of operations for stores located within these tourist markets. Increases in transportation and fuel costs, the financial condition of the airline industry and its impact on air travel, and sustained recessionary periods in the U.S. and internationally could also unfavorably impact results of the stores located within these tourist markets. The Companys business and results of operations are also subject to uncertainties arising out of world events. These uncertainties may include a global economic slowdown, changes in consumer spending or travel, an increase in gasoline and commodity prices, epidemics, and the economic consequences of natural disasters, military action or terrorist activity (including threats of terrorist activity). Any future events arising as a result of terrorist activity, natural disasters or other world events may have a material impact on the Companys business, its ability to source products, results of operations, and financial condition in the future. The Companys flagship SFA New York store is especially susceptible to volatility in the financial markets and employment and compensation trends in the financial sector. The Company is restricted in its ability to incur additional debt which may affect its ability to adequately finance its operations. Our revolving credit facility, our senior notes, and our 2.0% convertible notes contain restrictions on liens and sale/leaseback transactions, and our revolving credit facility also contains a restriction on additional indebtedness, in each case, subject to certain limited exceptions. These restrictions under the revolving credit agreement and the outstanding notes may affect the Companys ability to obtain additional debt financing or financing on favorable terms if its cash flow from operations and funds available under its revolving credit facility are insufficient to satisfy its working capital requirements. We are unable to predict the impact of potential disruptions in the credit markets and the resulting costs or constraints in obtaining financing on our business and financial results. The Companys principal sources of cash come from the Companys operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Disruptions in the credit markets have had a significant adverse impact on a 8 Table of Contents number of financial institutions and have affected the cost of capital available to the Company. The Company cannot predict with any certainty the impact of any further disruption in the credit environment or any resulting material impact on its liquidity, future financing costs or financial results. The Company is dependent on its relationships with certain designers, vendors, and other sources of merchandise. The Companys relationships with established and emerging designers are a key factor in its position as a retailer of luxury merchandise, and a substantial portion of its revenues are attributable to its sales of designer merchandise. Many of the Companys key vendors limit the number of retail outlets they use to sell their merchandise, and competition among luxury retailers to obtain and sell these goods is intense. The Companys relationships with its designers have been a significant contributor to its past success. Although the Company has supply arrangements with some of its merchandising sources, there can be no assurance that such sources will continue to meet the Companys quality, style, and volume requirements. Moreover, nearly all of the top designer brands sold by the Company are also sold by competing retailers, and many of these top designer brands also have their own dedicated retail stores. If one or more of these top designers were to cease providing the Company with adequate supplies of merchandise or, conversely, were to increase sales of merchandise through its own stores or to the stores of other competitors, the Companys business could be adversely affected. In addition, any decline in the popularity or quality of any of these designer brands could adversely affect the Companys business. The Companys business and results of operations may be adversely affected by weather conditions and natural disasters. The Companys business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions. Periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter or unseasonably cold or wet weather in the spring or summer affect consumer apparel purchases and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, severe weather conditions such as winter snowstorms or natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and floods may adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. The Companys business is intensely competitive and increased or new competition could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The retail industry is intensely competitive. As a retailer offering a broad selection of luxury fashion apparel, shoes, accessories, jewelry, cosmetics, and gift items, the Company currently competes with a diverse group of retailers, including e-commerce retailers, which sell, among other products, products similar to those of the Company. The Company also competes in particular markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of products that the Company sells. A number of different competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition including:  increased operational efficiencies of competitors;  competitive pricing strategies, including deep discount pricing by a broad range of retailers during periods of poor consumer confidence or economic instability;  expansion of product offerings by existing competitors;  entry by new competitors into markets in which the Company currently operates; and 9 Table of Contents  adoption by existing competitors of innovative retail sales methods. The Company may not be able to continue to compete successfully with its existing or new competitors, and prolonged periods of deep discount pricing by its competitors may have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. The Company faces risks associated with consumer preferences, demand, and fashion trends. Changes in consumer preferences, demand and interest could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. In addition, fashion trends could materially impact sales. Success in the retail business depends, in part, on the Companys ability to anticipate consumer preferences and demand. Early order commitments often are made far in advance of consumer acceptance. If the Company fails to anticipate accurately and respond to consumer preferences and demand, it could experience lower sales, excess inventories, and lower profit margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. The Company faces a number of risks in opening new stores. As part of its growth strategy, the Company could potentially increase the total number of stores, which may include opening new stores in both new and existing markets. The Company may not be able to operate any new stores profitably. The success of any future store openings will depend upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control, including the following:  the ability of management to adequately analyze and identify suitable markets and individual store sites within those markets;  the ability to attract appropriate vendors;  the competition for suitable store sites;  the ability to negotiate favorable lease terms with landlords;  the availability of employees to staff new stores and the Companys ability to hire, train, motivate, and retain store personnel; and  the ability to attract customers and generate sales sufficient to operate new stores profitably. In future years, the Company may enter into additional markets. These markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer trends, and discretionary spending patterns than its existing markets, which may cause new stores in these markets to be less successful than stores in existing markets. The loss of, or disruption in, the Companys centralized distribution centers would have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and operations. The Company depends on the orderly operation of the receiving and distribution process, which relies on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of distribution centers. Although the Company believes that its receiving and distribution process is efficient, and the Company has appropriate contingency plans, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or other shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to the Companys stores. 10 Table of Contents Additionally, freight cost is impacted by changes in fuel prices. Fuel prices affect freight cost both on inbound freight from vendors to the distribution centers and outbound freight from the distribution centers to the Companys stores. Although the Company maintains business interruption and property insurance, management cannot be assured that the Companys insurance coverage will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to the Company, if any of the distribution centers are shut down for any reason. Loss of the Companys trademarks and service marks or damage to the Companys brand could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. The Company owns many trademarks and service marks including, but not limited to, Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks & Company, SFA, S5A, The 5TH Avenue Club, SAKSFIRST, Clothes (Real), Saks Fifth Avenue Mens Collection, and OFF 5TH. Management believes its trademarks and service marks are important and that the loss of certain of its trademarks or trade names, particularly the store nameplates, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Many of the Companys trademarks and service marks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, the Company has a well-recognized brand that it believes represents unsurpassed customer service and quality merchandise. Any significant damage to the Companys brand or reputation may negatively impact same-store sales, lower employee morale and productivity, and diminish customer trust, resulting in a reduction in shareholder value. Fluctuations in foreign currency could have an adverse impact on the Companys business. The Company purchases a substantial portion of its inventory from foreign suppliers whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Although fluctuations in the Euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate have the largest impact on the Companys business, the Company procures goods from many countries and, consequently, is affected by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies of the countries from which the Company purchases goods. Accordingly, changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase the Companys cost of goods sold. If the Company is unable to pass such cost increases on to its customers or the higher cost of the products results in decreased consumption, gross margins and ultimately earnings would decrease. If the Company does not successfully upgrade, maintain and secure our information systems to support the needs of the organization, it could have an adverse impact on the Companys business. The Company relies heavily on information systems to manage operations, including a full range of retail, financial, sourcing and merchandising systems, and regularly make investments to upgrade, enhance or replace these systems. The reliability and capacity of information systems is critical. Despite our preventative efforts, the Companys systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses, power outages and other technical malfunctions. Any disruptions affecting the Companys information systems, or any delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or in integrating them with current systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, the Companys ability to continue to operate its business without significant interruption in the event of a disaster or other disruption depends in part on the ability of the Companys information systems to operate in accordance with our disaster recovery and business continuity plans. A privacy breach could adversely affect the Companys business. The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to the Company. The regulatory environment and industry standards surrounding information security and privacy continue to evolve in response 11 Table of Contents to increased threats to information security. In addition, customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could damage the Companys reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or litigation resulting in a decrease in the Companys earnings. Ownership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes the Company to possible liabilities and losses. A significant percentage of our SFA stores and one of our OFF 5TH stores are owned. The remainder of our SFA and OFF 5TH stores are leased. Accordingly, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, the value of the assets could decrease, and their costs to operate could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, and supply or demand for the use of the store, which may result from competition from similar stores in the area, as well as liability for environmental conditions. Store leases generally require the Company to pay a fixed minimum rent and a variable amount based on a percentage of annual sales at that location. The Company generally cannot terminate these leases. If a store is not profitable, and the Company decides to close it, the Company may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying rent for the balance of the applicable lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, the Company may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause the Company to close stores in desirable locations. If an existing owned store is not profitable, and the Company decides to close it, the Company may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store. In addition, the Company may not be able to close an unprofitable owned or leased store due to an existing operating covenant which may cause the Company to operate the location at a loss which could result in an impairment charge.
