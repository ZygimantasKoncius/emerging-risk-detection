Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur loan portfolio is concentrated in loans with a higher risk of lossOur real estate construction and land development loans are based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Origination and Sales of One-to-Four Family Residential Loans Consistent with our asset/liability management strategy, we sell a significant portion of our one-to-four family residential loans into the secondary market. Commitments to sell these mortgage loans generally are made during the period between the taking of the loan application and the closing of the mortgage loan. Most of these sale commitments are made on a best efforts basis whereby we are only obligated to sell the mortgage if the mortgage loan is approved and closed. As a result, management believes that market risk is minimal. In addition, some of our mortgage loan production is brokered to other lenders prior to funding. When we sell mortgage loans, we typically sell the servicing of the loans (i.e., collection of principal and interest payments). However, we serviced a minimal $49,000, $84,000 and $115,000 in mortgage loans for others as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The following table presents summary information concerning our origination and sale of our one-to-four family residential loans and the gains from the sale of loans.

(2) Excludes gains on sales of SBA loans. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit that are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We apply the same credit standards to these commitments as we use in all our lending activities and have included these commitments in our lending risk evaluations. Our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments. 8 Table of Contents The following table presents outstanding commitments to extend credit, including letters of credit, at the dates indicated: December 31, 2012 2011 (In thousands) Commercial business: Commercial and industrial $ 126,162 $ 138,118 Owner-occupied commercial real estate 2,151 2,328 Non-owner occupied commercial real estate 7,006 6,225 Total commercial business 135,319 146,671 One-to-four family residential   Real estate construction and land development: One-to-four family residential 4,662 4,247 Five or more family residential and commercial properties 26,301 15,305 Total real estate construction and land development 30,963 19,552 Consumer 34,525 37,251 Total outstanding commitments $ 200,807 $ 203,474 Delinquencies and Nonperforming Assets Delinquency Procedures. We send a borrower a delinquency notice 15 days after the due date when the borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan. If the delinquency is not brought current, additional delinquency notices are mailed at 30 and 45 days for commercial loans. Additional written and oral contacts are made with the borrower between 60 and 90 days after the due date. If a real estate loan payment is past due for 45 days or more, the collection manager may perform a review of the condition of the property if suspect. We may negotiate and accept a repayment program with the borrower, accept a voluntary deed in lieu of foreclosure or, when considered necessary, begin foreclosure proceedings. If foreclosed on, real property is sold at a public sale and we bid on the property to protect our interest. A decision as to whether and when to begin foreclosure proceedings is based on such factors as the amount of the outstanding loan relative to the value of the property securing the original indebtedness, the extent of the delinquency, and the borrowers ability and willingness to cooperate in resolving the delinquency. Real estate acquired by us is classified as other real estate owned until it is sold. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the estimated fair value (less costs to sell) at the date of acquisition, not to exceed net realizable value, and any resulting write-down is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Upon acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of the propertys net realizable value. Delinquencies in the commercial business loan portfolio are handled by the assigned loan officer. Generally, notices are sent and personal contact is made with the borrower when the loan is 15 days past due. Loan officers are responsible for collecting loans they originate or which are assigned to them. Depending on the nature of the loan and the type of collateral securing the loan, we may negotiate and accept a modified payment program or take other actions as circumstances warrant. Classification of Loans. Federal regulations require that our Banks periodically evaluate the risks inherent in their respective loan portfolios. In addition, the Division of Banks of the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (Division) and the FDIC have the authority to identify problem loans and, if appropriate, require them to be reclassified. There are three classifications for problem loans: Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss. Substandard loans have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility 9 Table of Contents that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful loans have the weaknesses of Substandard loans, with additional characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values questionable. There is a high probability of some loss in loans classified as Doubtful. A loan classified as Loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as a loan of the institution is not warranted. If a loan or a portion of the loan is classified as Loss, the institution must charge-off this amount. We also have loans we classify as Watch and Other Assets Especially Mentioned (OAEM). Loans classified as Watch are performing assets but have elements of risk that require more monitoring than other performing loans. Loans classified as OAEM are assets that continue to perform but have shown deterioration in credit quality and require close monitoring. The Banks routinely test their problem loans for potential impairment. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Banks will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. Problem loans that may be impaired are identified using the Banks normal loan review procedures, which include post-approval reviews, monthly reviews by credit administration of criticized loan reports, scheduled internal reviews, underwriting during extensions and renewals and the analysis of information routinely received on a borrowers financial performance. Impairment is measured using the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loans effective interest rate, unless the loan is collateral dependent, in which case impairment is measured using the fair value of the collateral after deducting appropriate collateral disposition costs. Furthermore, when it is practically expedient, impairment is measured by the fair market price of the loan. Subsequent to an initial measure of impairment, if there is a significant change in the amount or timing of a loans expected future cash flows or a change in the value of collateral or market price of a loan, based on new information received, the impairment is recalculated. However, the net carrying value of a loan never exceeds the recorded investment in the loan. 10 Table of Contents Nonperforming Assets. Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned. The following table provides information about our originated nonaccrual loans, restructured loans, and other real estate owned for the indicated dates.

There were no troubled debt restructures at December 31, 2008. (2) $1.2 million, $1.8 million, $3.2 million and $2.3 million of originated nonaccrual loans were guaranteed by government agencies at December 31, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no nonaccrual loans guaranteed by government agencies at December 31, 2008. (3) $679,000 and $592,000 of originated performing restructured loans were guaranteed by government agencies at December 31, 2012 and 2011. There were no originated performing restructured loans guaranteed by government agencies at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. (4) There were no accruing originated loans past due 90 days or more that were guaranteed by government agencies at December 31, 2012, 2009, and 2008. $6,000 and $92,000 of accruing originated loans past due 90 days or more were guaranteed by government agencies at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. (5) $3.2 million, $2.8 million, $5.4 million and $7.2 million of originated potential problem loans were guaranteed by government agencies at December 31, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no potential problem originated loans guaranteed by government agencies at December 31, 2008. (6) Excludes portions guaranteed by government agencies. 11 Table of Contents Nonaccrual Loans. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, including the recognition of interest income on our loan portfolio, unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Loans are considered to be impaired and are placed on nonaccrual status when there are serious doubts about the collectability of principal or interest. Our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan becomes past due for 90 days or more, is less than fully collateralized, and is not in the process of collection. Payments received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected. Nonaccrual originated loans decreased to $12.5 million, or 1.28% of total originated loans, at December 31, 2012 from $23.3 million, or 2.57% of total originated loans, at December 31, 2011 due to the loan resolution efforts of our credit department. During the year ended December 31, 2012, there were $3.9 million in net charge-offs of originated loans of which $2.1 million related to nonperforming commercial business loans and $1.2 million related to nonperforming real estate construction and land development loans. In addition, $7.4 million of loans were transferred to other real estate owned during the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease in total nonperforming originated loans was partially offset by $1.3 million in additions to nonperforming originated loans which were outstanding as of December 31, 2012. Nonperforming originated assets decreased to $17.9 million, or 1.39% of total originated assets, at December 31, 2012 from $27.0 million, or 2.14% of total originated assets, at December 31, 2011 due to a decrease in nonperforming originated loans discussed above offset partially by an increase in other real estate owned. Originated restructured performing loans as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 were $15.0 million and $13.8 million, respectively. The increase in originated restructured performing loans was primarily due to the addition of 14 commercial and industrial loans that were modified during the year and were considered troubled debt restructured loans with an outstanding principal balance of $2.4 million at December 31, 2012. Originated potential problem loans as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 were $28.3 million and $29.7 million, respectively. Potential problem loans are those loans that are currently accruing interest and are not considered impaired, but which we are monitoring because the financial information of the borrower causes us concerns as to their ability to comply with their loan repayment terms. Loans that are past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest are both well secured and in the process of collection. Troubled Debt Restructured Loans. A troubled debt restructured loan (TDR) is a restructuring in which the Banks, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties, grant a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider. The majority of the Banks TDRs are a result of granting extensions to troubled credits which have already been adversely classified. We grant such extensions to reassess the borrowers financial status and develop a plan for repayment. Certain modifications with extensions also include interest rate reductions, which is the second most prevalent concession. The interest rate reductions can be for a period of time or over the remainder of the life of the loan. We may also bifurcate troubled credits into a good loan and a bad loan, whereas the good loan continues to accrue under the modified terms. We perform bifurcations to limit potential losses. The remainders of the Banks TDRs are the result of converting revolving lines of credits to amortizing loans, changing amortizing loans to interest-only loans with balloon payments, or re-amortizing the loan over a longer period of time. These modifications would all be considered a concession for a borrower that could not obtain financing outside of the Banks. We do not forgive principal for a majority of our TDRs, but in those situations where principal is forgiven, the entire amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off to the extent not done so prior to the modification. We sometimes delay the timing on the repayment of a portion of principal (principal forbearance) and charge-off the amount of forbearance if that amount is not considered fully collectible. We also consider insignificant delays in payments when determining if a loan should be classified as a TDR. TDRs are considered impaired and are separately measured for impairment under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) 310-10-35, whether on accrual or 12 Table of Contents nonaccrual status. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the balance of accruing TDRs was $15.0 million and $13.8 million, respectively. The related allowance for loan losses on the accruing TDRs was $2.1 million as of December 31, 2012 and $1.4 million as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012, non-accruing TDRs were $9.3 million and had a related allowance for loan losses of $2.0 million. At December 31, 2011, non-accruing TDRs of $11.7 million had a related allowance for loan losses of $1.8 million. A loan may have the TDR classification removed if (a) the restructured interest rate was greater than or equal to the interest rate of a new loan with comparable risk at the time of the restructure, and (b) the loan is no longer impaired based on the terms of the restructured agreement. The Banks policy is that the borrower must demonstrate six consecutive monthly payments in accordance with the modified loan before it can be reviewed for removal of TDR classification under the second criteria. However, the loan must be reported as a TDR in at least one of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K. Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans are those loans that are currently accruing interest and are not considered impaired, but which we are monitoring because the financial information of the borrower causes us concerns as to their ability to comply with their loan repayment terms. Loans that are past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest are both well secured and in the process of collection. Originated potential problem loans decreased $1.5 million to $28.3 million at December 31, 2012 from $29.7 million at December 31, 2011. Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses Management maintains an allowance for loan losses (ALL) to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the ALL is monitored through our ongoing quarterly loan quality assessments. We assess the estimated credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio by considering a number of elements including:  Historical loss experience in a number of homogeneous segments of the loan portfolio;  The impact of environmental factors, including:  Levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans;  Levels and trends in charge-offs and recoveries;  Effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices;  Experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff;  National and local economic trends and conditions;  External factors such as competition, legal, and regulatory requirements; and  Effects of changes in credit concentrations. We calculate an appropriate ALL for the non-classified and classified performing loans in our loan portfolio by applying historical loss factors for homogeneous classes of the portfolio, adjusted for changes to the above-noted environmental factors. We may record specific provisions for impaired loans, including loans on nonaccrual status and TDRs, after a careful analysis of each loans credit and collateral factors. Our analysis of an appropriate ALL combines the provisions made for our non-classified loans, classified loans, and the specific provisions made for each impaired loan. While we believe we use the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses, results of operations could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the allowance. A further decline in local and national economic conditions, or other factors, could 13 Table of Contents result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and may adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of their routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional allowance allocations based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. The following table provides information regarding changes in our allowance for originated loan losses at and for the indicated periods: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Originated loans outstanding at end of period(1) $ 874,485 $ 837,924 $ 742,019 $ 772,247 $ 808,726 Average originated loans receivable during period(1) $ 855,923 $ 833,441 $ 717,159 $ 787,527 $ 795,752 Allowance for loan losses on originated loans at beginning of period $ 22,317 $ 22,062 $ 26,164 $ 15,423 $ 10,374 Provision for loan losses on originated loans 695 5,180 11,990 19,390 7,420 Charge-offs: Commercial business (3,702 ) (2,690 ) (8,106 ) (2,668 ) (144 ) One-to-four family residential (349 ) (15 ) (169 ) (189 ) (280 ) Real estate construction and land development (1,280 ) (2,948 ) (8,344 ) (5,774 ) (1,818 ) Consumer (293 ) (316 ) (73 ) (192 ) (165 ) Total charge-offs (5,624 ) (5,969 ) (16,692 ) (8,823 ) (2,407 ) Recoveries: Commercial business 1,579 821 243 1 1 One-to-four family residential   15 1  Real estate construction and land development 125 201 285 50  Consumer 33 22 57 122 35 Total recoveries 1,737 1,044 600 174 36 Net charge-offs (3,887 ) (4,925 ) (16,092 ) (8,649 ) (2,371 ) Allowance for originated loan losses at end of period $ 19,125 $ 22,317 $ 22,062 $ 26,164 $ 15,423 Ratio of net charge-offs during period to average originated loans receivable (0.45 )% (0.59 )% (2.24 )% (1.10 )% (0.30 )% (1) Excludes loans held for sale. 14 Table of Contents The following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for originated loans at the indicated periods.

Investment Activities At December 31, 2012, our investment securities portfolio totaled $154.4 million, which consisted of $144.3 million of securities available for sale and $10.1 million of securities held to maturity. This compares with a total portfolio of $156.7 million at December 31, 2011, which was comprised of $144.6 million of securities available for sale and $12.1 million of securities held to maturity. The composition of the two investment portfolios by type of security, at each respective date, is presented in Note 6 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our investment policy is established by the Board of Directors and monitored by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. It is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity, generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and complements our Banks lending activities. The policy dictates the criteria for classifying securities as either available for sale or held to maturity. The policy permits investment in various types of liquid assets permissible under applicable regulations, which include U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. Government agency obligations, some certificates of deposit of insured banks, mortgage backed and mortgage related securities, corporate notes, municipal bonds, and federal funds. Investment in non-investment grade bonds and stripped mortgage backed securities are not permitted under the policy. 15 Table of Contents The following table provides information regarding our investment securities available for sale at the dates indicated.

The Banks are required to maintain an investment in the stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Seattle in an amount equal to the greater of $500,000 or 0.50% of residential mortgage loans and pass-through securities or an advance requirement to be confirmed on the date of the advance and 5.0% of the outstanding balance of mortgage loans sold to the FHLB of Seattle. At December 31, 2012 the Banks were required to maintain an investment in the stock of FHLB of Seattle of at least $1.2 million and the Banks had an investment in FHLB stock carried at a cost basis (par value) of $5.5 million. Consistent with its accounting policy, the Company evaluated its investment in FHLB of Seattle stock for other-than-temporary impairment. The Company took into consideration that in September 2012, the FHLB of Seattle announced that it had been reclassified as adequately capitalized by its regulator, the Federal Housing 17 Table of Contents Finance Agency. Based on the Companys evaluation of the underlying investment, including the long-term nature of the investment, the liquidity position of the FHLB of Seattle, the actions being taken by the FHLB of Seattle to address its regulatory situation and the Companys intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the par value, the Company did not recognize an other-than-temporary impairment loss on its FHLB of Seattle stock during the year ended December 31, 2012. Despite improvements in the FHLB of Seattles regulatory situation, any deterioration in the FHLB of Seattles financial position may result in future impairment losses. Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds General. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, loan repayments and borrowings. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposits and unscheduled loan prepayments, which are influenced significantly by general interest rate levels, interest rates available on other investments, competition, economic conditions, and other factors are not. Customer deposits remain an important source of funding, but these balances have been influenced in the past by adverse market conditions in the industry and may be affected by future developments such as interest rate fluctuations and new competitive pressures. In addition to customer deposits management may utilize brokered deposits on an as-needed basis. Borrowings may also be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds (such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels). Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending activities and match the maturity of repricing intervals of assets. In addition, since 2009 the Company has utilized repurchase agreements as a supplement to other funding sources. During the year ended December 31 2012, non-maturity deposits (total deposits less certificate of deposit accounts) increased $22.6 million, or 2.8%, to $829.0 million. As a result, the percentage of certificate of deposit accounts to total deposits decreased to 25.8% at December 31, 2012 from 29.0% at December 31, 2011. Deposit Activities. We offer a variety of deposit accounts designed to attract both short-term and long-term deposits. These accounts include noninterest demand accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs). These accounts, with the exception of noninterest demand accounts, generally earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and managements desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits. The major categories of deposit accounts are described below. Noninterest Demand Deposits. Noninterest demand deposits are noninterest bearing and may be charged service fees based on activity and balances. NOW Accounts. NOW accounts are interest bearing and may be charged service fees based on activity and balances. NOW accounts pay interest, but require a higher minimum balance to avoid service charges. Money Market Accounts. Money market accounts pay a variable interest rate that is tiered depending on the balance maintained in the account. Minimum opening balances vary. Savings Accounts. We offer savings accounts that allow for unlimited deposits and withdrawals, provided that a $100 minimum balance is maintained. CDs. We offer several types of CDs with maturities ranging from three months to five years, which require a minimum deposit of $2,500. Negotiable CDs are offered in amounts of $100,000 or more for terms of 30 days to five years. 18 Table of Contents The following table provides the balances outstanding for each major category of deposits for the periods indicated: December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Noninterest demand deposits $ 247,048 22.1 % $ 230,993 20.4 % $ 194,583 17.1 % NOW accounts 303,487 27.2 304,818 26.8 287,247 25.3 Money market accounts 157,728 14.1 166,913 14.7 150,953 13.3 Savings accounts 120,781 10.8 103,716 9.1 100,552 8.8 Total non-maturity deposits 829,044 74.2 806,440 71.0 733,335 64.5 CDs 288,927 25.8 329,604 29.0 402,941 35.5 Total deposits $ 1,117,971 100.0 % $ 1,136,044 100.0 % $ 1,136,276 100.0 % The following table provides the average balances outstanding and the weighted average interest rates for each major category of deposits for the years indicated: Year ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 AverageBalance AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance AverageYield/Rate (Dollars in thousands) NOW accounts and money market accounts $ 466,268 0.27 % $ 453,509 0.41 % $ 376,245 0.58 % Savings accounts 113,119 0.18 103,170 0.35 89,978 0.56 CDs 306,772 0.98 355,167 1.20 351,191 1.62 Total interest bearing deposits 886,159 0.50 911,846 0.71 817,414 1.02 Noninterest demand deposits 237,888  205,862  150,906  Total deposits $ 1,124,047 0.40 % $ 1,117,708 0.58 % $ 968,320 0.87 % The following table shows the amount and maturity of certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more: December 31,2012 (In thousands) Remaining maturity: Three months or less $ 30,623 Over three months through six months 24,120 Over six months through twelve months 30,895 Over twelve months 79,250 Total $ 164,888 Borrowings. Deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and our general business purposes. We rely upon advances from the FHLB to supplement our supply of lendable funds and meet deposit withdrawal requirements. The FHLB of Seattle serves as one of our secondary sources of liquidity. Advances from the FHLB of Seattle are typically secured by our first lien single family mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans and stock issued by the FHLB, which is owned by us. At December 31, 2012, the Banks maintained an uncommitted credit facility with the FHLB of Seattle in a collective amount of $156.3 million and an uncommitted credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in a collective amount of $61.1 million, of which there were no advances or borrowings outstanding. The Banks also maintain 19 Table of Contents advance lines with Zions Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, US Bank and Pacific Coast Bankers Bank to purchase federal funds in a collective amount of up to $57.8 million as of December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012 we had securities sold under agreement to repurchase of $16.0 million which were secured by available for sale investment securities. The FHLB functions provide credit for member financial institutions. As members, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States) provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made pursuant to several different programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institutions net worth or on the FHLBs assessment of the institutions creditworthiness. Under its current credit policies, the FHLB of Seattle limits advances to 20% of assets for Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank.

Supervision and Regulation We are subject to extensive Federal and Washington State legislation, regulation, and supervision. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, the FDIC and shareholders. The laws and regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies have changed significantly particularly in connection with the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). See Other Regulatory DevelopmentsThe Dodd-Frank Act herein for a discussion of this legislation. Any change in applicable laws, regulations, or regulatory policies may have a material effect on our business, operations, and prospects. We cannot predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that any fiscal or monetary policies or new Federal or State legislation may have in the future. The following is a brief discussion of certain laws and regulations applicable to Heritage Financial and the Banks which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. Heritage Financial. We are subject to regulation as a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and are supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). The Federal Reserve has the authority to order bank holding companies to cease and desist from unsound practices and violations of conditions imposed on them. The Federal Reserve is also empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies and individuals who violate the Bank Holding Company Act or orders or regulations thereunder in amounts up to $1.0 million per day. The Federal Reserve may order termination of non-banking activities by non-banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies, or divestiture of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company. Some violations may also result in criminal penalties. The FDIC is authorized to exercise comparable authority under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and other statutes for state nonmember banks such as Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank. 20 Table of Contents The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. The Dodd-Frank Act and earlier Federal Reserve policy provide that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks by having the ability to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial distress. A bank holding companys failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserves regulations or both. The Dodd-Frank Act requires new regulations to be promulgated concerning the source of strength. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires an undercapitalized bank to develop a capital restoration plan, approved by the FDIC, with a guaranty by the company having control of the bank, of the banks compliance with the plan. We are required to file annual and periodic reports with the Federal Reserve and provide additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may examine us, and any of our subsidiaries, and charge us for the cost of the examination. We, and any subsidiaries which we may control, are considered affiliates within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between our bank subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, we and our subsidiaries are prohibited from tying the provision of various products or services, such as extensions of credit, to other products or services offered by us, or our affiliates. Bank regulations require bank holding companies and banks to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of core capital to adjusted quarterly average total assets of at least 3%. In addition, banking regulators have adopted risk-based capital guidelines under which risk percentages are assigned to various categories of assets and off-balance sheet items to calculate a risk-adjusted capital ratio. Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stockholders equity (which does not include unrealized gains and losses on securities), less goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan losses and subordinated debt, both subject to some limitations. Regulatory risk-based capital guidelines require Tier 1 capital of 4% of risk-adjusted assets and minimum total capital ratio (combined Tier 1 and Tier 2) of 8% of risk-adjusted assets. The Dodd-Frank Act requires new capital regulations to be adopted; however, the adoption of the capital regulations as proposed in December 2011 have been delayed. For additional information, see Capital Adequacy below. Subsidiaries. Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank are Washington-chartered commercial banks, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC. Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank are subject to regulation by the FDIC and the Division. Applicable Federal and State statutes and regulations which govern a banks operations relate to minimum capital requirements, required reserves against deposits, investments, loans, legal lending limits, mergers and consolidation, borrowings, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches, and other aspects of its operations, among other things. The Division and the FDIC also have authority to prohibit banks under their supervision from engaging in what they consider to be unsafe and unsound practices. The Banks are required to file periodic reports with the FDIC and the Division, and are subject to periodic examinations and evaluations by those regulatory authorities. Based upon these evaluations, the regulators may revalue the assets of an institution and require that it establish specific reserves to compensate for the differences between the determined value and the book value of such assets. These examinations must be conducted every 12 months, except that well-capitalized banks may be examined every 18 months. The FDIC and the Division may each accept the results of an examination by the other in lieu of conducting an independent examination. Dividends paid by the Banks provide substantially all of our cash flow. Applicable Federal and Washington State regulations restrict capital distributions by our Banks, including dividends. Such restrictions are tied to the institutions capital levels after giving effect to such distributions. For an additional discussion of restrictions on the payment of dividends, see Part II of Item 5. Market for the Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchased of Equity Securities herein. 21 Table of Contents Capital Adequacy. The Federal Reserve and FDIC have issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and banks. In addition, these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a bank holding company or bank maintain capital above the minimum levels, based on its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth. The Federal Reserves risk-based guidelines for bank holding companies establish a two-tier capital framework. Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stockholders equity (which does not include unrealized gains and losses on securities), less goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan losses and subordinated debt, both subject to some limitations. The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital represents qualifying total capital, at least 50% of which must consist of Tier 1 capital. Risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing Tier 1 and total capital by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet exposures are assigned to one of four categories of risk-weights, based primarily on relative credit risk. The minimum Tier 1 risk- based capital ratios under these guidelines at December 31, 2012 were 4% and 8%, respectively. At December 31, 2012, we had consolidated Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital of 18.7% and 19.9%, respectively. The Federal Reserves leverage capital guidelines establish a minimum leverage ratio determined by dividing Tier 1 capital by adjusted average total assets. The minimum leverage ratio is 3% for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating. All other bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4%. At December 31, 2012, we had a consolidated leverage ratio of 13.6%. In connection with the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in June 2012, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approved proposed rules that would substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Company and the Banks. The proposed rules implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III refers to various documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The proposed rules were subject to a public comment period that has expired and there is no date set for the adoption of final rules. The proposed rules include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which would be phased in during 2013 and 2014, and would refine the definitions of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios. The proposed new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Banks under the proposals would be: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The proposed rules would also establish a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of the new regulatory minimum capital ratios would result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations would establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. The proposed rules also implement other revisions to the current capital rules such as recognition of all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities, and provide that instruments that will no longer qualify as capital would be phased out over time. The federal bank regulatory agencies also proposed revisions to the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including the Banks, if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. These revisions would take effect January 1, 2015. Under the prompt corrective action requirements, insured depository institutions would be required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as well capitalized: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based 22 Table of Contents capital ratio of 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%); (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged from the current rules). The proposed rules set forth certain changes for the calculation of risk-weighted assets and utilize an increased number of credit risk and other exposure categories and risk weights. In addition, the proposed rules also address: (i) a proposed alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act; (ii) revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation; (iii) rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans; and (iv) revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions. In particular, the proposed rules would expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures. Higher risk weights would apply to a variety of exposure categories. Specifics include, among others:  Applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans.  For residential mortgage exposures, the current approach of a 50% risk weight for high-quality seasoned mortgages and a 100% risk-weight for all other mortgages is replaced with a risk weight of between 35% and 200% depending upon the mortgages loan-to-value ratio and whether the mortgage is a category 1 or category 2 residential mortgage exposure (based on eight criteria that include, among others, the term, seniority of the lien, use of negative amortization, balloon payments and certain rate increases).  Assigning a 150% risk weight to exposures (other than residential mortgage exposures) that are 90 days past due.  Providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%).  Providing for a 100% risk weight for claims on securities firms.  Eliminating the current 50% cap on the risk weight for OTC derivatives. The FDIC may impose additional restrictions on institutions that are undercapitalized and generally is authorized to reclassify an institution into a lower capital category and impose the restrictions applicable to such category if the institution is engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. An institution is deemed well capitalized if it has at least a 5% Tier 1 capital ratio, a 6.0% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and 10.0% total risk-based capital ratio. At December 31, 2012, the Banks were considered well capitalized institutions. For a complete description of the Companys and the Banks required and actual capital levels as of December 31, 2012, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Prompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institutions category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital measure, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework. Under these regulations, an institution is treated as well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is 10% or more, its ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets is 6% or more, its ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets (leverage ratio) is 5% or more, and it is not subject to any federal supervisory order or directive to meet a specific capital level. In order to be adequately capitalized, an institution must have a total risk-based capital ratio of not less than 8%, a core capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of not less than 4%, and a leverage ratio of not 23 Table of Contents less than 4%. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by either Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if unremedied, result in progressively more severe restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements. As of December 31, 2012, the Banks met the requirements to be classified as well-capitalized. Federal law generally bars institutions which are not well capitalized from soliciting or accepting brokered deposits bearing interest rates significantly higher than prevailing market rates. Deposit Insurance and Other FDIC Programs. The deposits of the Banks are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), which is administered by the FDIC. The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures the deposits, up to applicable limits, of depository institutions. As insurer of the Banks deposits, the FDIC has supervisory and enforcement authority over Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank and this insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by institutions insured by the FDIC. It also may prohibit any institution insured by the FDIC from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the institution and the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. As a result of a decline in the reserve ratio (the ratio of the net worth of the DIF to estimated insured deposits) and concerns about expected failure costs and available liquid assets in the DIF, the FDIC adopted a rule requiring each insured institution to prepay on December 30, 2009 the estimated amount of its quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and all quarters through the end of 2012 (in addition to the regular quarterly assessment for the third quarter due on December 30, 2009). The prepaid amount is recorded as an asset with a zero risk weight and the institution will continue to record quarterly expenses for deposit insurance. For purposes of calculating the prepaid amount, assessments are measured at the institutions assessment rate as of September 30, 2009, with a uniform increase of three basis points effective January 1, 2011, and are based on the institutions assessment base for the third quarter of 2009, with growth assumed quarterly at annual rate of 5%. If events cause actual assessments during the prepayment period to vary from the prepaid amount, institutions will pay excess assessments in cash, or receive a rebate of prepaid amounts not exhausted after collection of assessments due on June 13, 2013, as applicable. Collection of the prepayment does not preclude the FDIC from changing assessment rates or revising the risk-based assessment system in the future. The rule includes a process for exemption from the prepayment for institutions whose safety and soundness would be affected adversely. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDICs deposit insurance assessments to be based on assets instead of deposits. The FDIC issued rules, effective as of the second quarter of 2011, which specify that the assessment base for a bank is equal to its total average consolidated assets less average tangible capital. The FDIC assessment rates range from approximately five basis points to 35 basis points, depending on applicable adjustments for unsecured debt issued by an institution and brokered deposits (and to further adjustment for institutions that hold unsecured debt of other FDIC-insured institutions), until such time as the FDICs reserve ratio equals 1.15%. Once the FDICs reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and the reserve ratio for the immediately prior assessment period is less than 2.0%, the applicable assessment rates may range from three basis points to 30 basis 24 Table of Contents points (subject to adjustments as described above). If the reserve ratio for the prior assessment period is equal to, or greater than 2.0% and less than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from two basis points to 28 basis points and if the prior assessment period is greater than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from one basis point to 25 basis points (in each case subject to adjustments as described above. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against banks and savings associations. Other Regulatory Developments. Significant federal banking legislation has been enacted in recent years. The following summarizes some of the recent significant federal banking legislation. The Dodd-Frank Act: On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that, among other things, has or will:  Centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency within the Federal Reserve Board, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, with broad rulemaking, supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that applies to all banks and thrifts. Smaller financial institutions, including the Banks, are subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws.  Required the federal banking regulators to promulgate new capital regulations and seek to make their capital requirements countercyclical, so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction.  Provided for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance.  Made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and provide unlimited federal deposit insurance until January 1, 2013 for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions.  Effective July 21, 2011, repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.  Required all depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to their depository institution subsidiaries in the event such subsidiaries suffer from financial distress. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company and the financial services industry more generally. The elimination of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits could materially increase our interest expense, depending on our competitors responses. Provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of the Company and the Banks could require the Company and the Banks to seek additional sources of capital in the future. Sarbanes-Oxley Act. On July 30, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was signed into law in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection with various accounting scandals. The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the 25 Table of Contents accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act includes very specific additional disclosure requirements and corporate governance rules, requires the SEC and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and other related rules. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. Our policies and procedures have been updated to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Financial Services Reform Legislation. On November 12, 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) was enacted into law. The GLBA removes various barriers imposed by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, specifically those prohibiting banks and bank holding companies from engaging in the securities and insurance business. The GLBA also expands the bank holding company act framework to permit bank holding companies with subsidiary banks meeting certain capital and management requirements to elect to become a financial holding company. Financial holding companies may engage in a full range of financial activities, including not only banking, insurance, and securities activities, but also merchant banking and additional activities determined to be financial in nature or complementary to an activity that is financial in nature. The GLBA also provides that the list of permissible financial activities will be expanded as necessary for a financial holding company to keep abreast of competitive and technological changes. In addition, the GLBA expands the activities in which insured state banks may engage. Under the GLBA, insured state banks are given the ability to engage in financial activities through a subsidiary, as long as the bank and its affiliates meet and comply with certain requirements. First, each bank must be well capitalized. Second, the bank must comply with certain capital deduction and financial statement requirements provided under the GLBA. Third, the bank must comply with certain financial and operational safeguards provided under the GLBA. Fourth, the bank must comply with the limits imposed by the GLBA on transactions with affiliates. Website Access to Company Reports We post publicly available reports required to be filed with the SEC on our website, www.HF-WA.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such reports with the SEC. The required reports are available free of charge through our website. Code of Ethics We have adopted Code of Ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and controller. We have posted the text of our code of ethics at www.HF-WA.com in the section titled Investor Information: Corporate Governance. Any waivers of the code of the ethics will be publicly disclosed to shareholders. Competition We compete for loans and deposits with other commercial banks, credit unions, mortgage bankers, and other institutions in the scope and type of services offered, interest rates paid on deposits, pricing of loans, and number and locations of branches, among other things. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do. Particularly in times of high or rising interest rates, we also face significant competition for investors funds from short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities. 26 Table of Contents We compete for loans principally through the range and quality of the services we provide, interest rates and loan fees, and the locations of our Banks branches. We actively solicit deposit-related clients and compete for deposits by offering depositors a variety of savings accounts, checking accounts, cash management and other services. Employees We had 363 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2012. We believe that employees play a vital role in the success of a service company. Employees are provided with a variety of benefits such as medical, vision, dental and life insurance, a retirement plan, and paid vacations and sick leave. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Executive Officers The following table set forth certain information with respect to the executive officers of the Company.

RISK FACTORS We assume and manage a certain degree of risk in order to conduct our business strategy. The following provides a discussion of certain risks that management believes are specific to our business. This discussion should not be viewed as an all inclusive list or in any particular order. Our strategy of pursuing acquisitions and de novo branching exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could adversely affect us. We are pursuing a strategy of supplementing organic growth by acquiring other financial institutions or their businesses that we believe will help us fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings. There are risks associated with this strategy, however, including the following:  we may be exposed to potential asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks, businesses, assets and liabilities we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially negatively affected;  prices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices we considered acceptable and expect that we may continue to experience this condition in the future;  the acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity into our company to make the transaction economically successful. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of an acquisition within the expected time frame, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. We may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful. These risks are present in our completed FDIC-assisted transactions involving our assumption of deposits and the acquisition of assets of Cowlitz Bank and Pierce Commercial Bank and in the recently completed acquisition of Northwest Commercial Bank; 28 Table of Contents  to finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or raise additional capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders.  we completed two acquisitions during 2010 and one in January 2013 that enhanced our rate of growth. We may not be able to continue to sustain our past rate of growth or to grow at all in the future;  we expect our net income will increase following our acquisitions, however, we also expect our general and administrative expenses and consequently our efficiency ratios will also increase. Ultimately, we would expect our efficiency ratio to improve; however, if we are not successful in our integration process, this may not occur, and our acquisitions or branching activities may not be accretive to earnings in the short or long-term; and  the purchase and assumption agreement and the shared-loss agreements we entered into with the FDIC in connection with the Cowlitz and Pierce Commercial Acquisitions, have specific, detailed and cumbersome compliance, servicing, notification and reporting requirements. Our failure to comply with the terms of the agreements or to properly service the loans and real estate owned under the requirements of the shared-loss agreements may cause individual loans or large pools of loans to lose eligibility for loss share payments from the FDIC. This could result in material losses that are currently not anticipated. Our business strategy includes significant growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. We intend to pursue a significant growth strategy for our business. We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities. If appropriate opportunities present themselves, we expect to engage in selected acquisitions of financial institutions in the future, including FDIC-assisted transactions, branch acquisitions, or other business growth initiatives or undertakings. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities, that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities, if undertaken, will be successful. Our growth initiatives may require us to recruit experienced personnel to assist in such initiatives, which will increase our compensation costs. In addition, the failure to identify and retain such personnel would place significant limitations on our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy. To the extent we expand our lending beyond our current market areas, we also could incur additional risk related to those new market areas. We may not be able to expand our market presence in our existing market areas or successfully enter new markets. If we do not successfully execute our acquisition growth plan, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and growth prospects. In addition, if we were to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired, that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us, which would adversely affect our results of operations. While we believe we have the executive management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, there can be no assurance that suitable growth opportunities will be available or that we will successfully manage our growth. See -If the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions becomes impaired, our earnings and capital could be reduced and -Our strategy of pursuing acquisitions and de novo branching exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could adversely affect us for additional risks related to our acquisition strategy. Failure to comply with the terms of the shared-loss agreements with the FDIC may result in significant losses. In connection with the Cowlitz Bank Acquisition, Heritage Bank entered into shared-loss agreements with the FDIC that significantly reduce the Banks credit loss exposure. The purchase and assumption agreement and the shared-loss agreements for the Cowlitz Bank Acquisition have specific, detailed and cumbersome compliance, servicing, notification and reporting requirements. Our failure to comply with the terms of the agreements or to properly service the loans and other real estate owned under the requirements of the shared-loss agreement may cause individual loans or large pools of loans to lose eligibility for loss share payments from the FDIC. This could result in material losses that are currently not anticipated. 29 Table of Contents We may engage in additional FDIC-assisted transactions, which could present additional risks to our business. We may have additional opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in FDIC-assisted transactions. Although these FDIC-assisted transactions typically provide for FDIC assistance to an acquirer to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution, we are (and would be in future transactions) subject to many of the same risks we would experience in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction, including risks associated with maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect. In addition, because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time and access to information normally associated with preparing for and evaluating a negotiated acquisition, we may face additional risks in FDIC-assisted transactions, including additional pressure on management resources, management of problem loans, problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems, and the resulting impact to our capital resources that may require us to raise additional capital. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with FDIC-assisted transactions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations, including new financial reform legislation recently enacted by Congress that is expected to increase our costs of operations. We are subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve and Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by the FDIC and the Division. The Federal Reserve, FDIC and Division govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on an institutions operations, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of an institutions allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and has affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting and implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to have a near term impact on our operations. For example, a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called golden parachute payments and authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidate using a companys proxy materials. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded. 30 Table of Contents The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Financial institutions such as Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. It is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact the Dodd-Frank Act and the yet to be written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks. However, it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense. Any additional changes in our regulation and oversight, whether in the form of new laws, rules or regulations, could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects. As the Company and Banks continue to monitor developments under the Dodd-Frank Act and to assess the ultimate impact of the legislation and yet to be written implementing rules and regulations on community banks, at a minimum we expect to experience an increase in our operating and compliance costs, which is expected to continue and further impact our interest expense. The short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and anticipated new capital rules is uncertain. In June 2012, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and the OCC proposed rules that would substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the us, Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank. The proposed rules were subject to a public comment period that has expired and there is no date set for the adoption of final rules. Various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act increase the capital requirements of bank holding companies, such as Heritage Financial Corporation. The leverage and risk-based capital ratios of these entities may not be lower than the leverage and risk-based capital ratios for insured depository institutions. The proposed rules include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which would be phased in during 2013 and 2014, and would refine the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios. The proposed new minimum capital level requirements applicable to us, Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank under the proposals would be: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The proposed rules would also establish a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and would result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations would establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. While the proposed Basel III changes and other regulatory capital requirements will likely result in generally higher regulatory capital standards, it is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards will ultimately be applied to us, Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank. In addition, in the current economic and regulatory environment, regulators of banks and bank holding companies have become more likely to impose capital requirements on bank holding companies and banks that are more stringent than those required by applicable existing regulations. 31 Table of Contents The application of more stringent capital requirements for us, Heritage Bank and Central Valley Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares. Our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans with a higher risk of loss. Repayment of our commercial business loans, consisting of commercial and industrial loans as well as owner-occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. We offer different types of commercial loans to a variety of businesses with a focus on real estate related industries and businesses in agricultural, healthcare, legal, and other professions. The types of commercial loans offered are business lines of credit, term equipment financing and term real estate loans. We also originate loans that are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, or SBA, and are a preferred lender of the SBA. Commercial business lending involves risks that are different from those associated with real estate lending. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts established on predetermined loan to collateral values and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral being viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Our commercial business loans are primarily made based on our assessment of the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The borrowers cash flow may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things. Accordingly, the repayment of commercial business loans depends primarily on the cash flow and creditworthiness of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. In addition, as part of our commercial business lending activities, we originate agricultural loans. Payments on agricultural loans are typically dependent on the profitable operation or management of the related farm property. The success of the farm may be affected by many factors outside the control of the borrower, including adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crop or limit crop yields, declines in market prices for agricultural products and the impact of government regulations. In addition, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm. If the cash flow from a farming operation is diminished, the borrowers ability to repay the loan may be impaired. At December 31, 2012, our originated commercial business loans (consisting of commercial and industrial loans, owner-occupied commercial real estate loans and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans) totaled $731.6 million, or approximately 83.7% of our total originated loan portfolio. Our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, which includes five or more family residential real estate loans, involve higher principal amounts than other loans and repayment of these loans may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers. We originate commercial and five or more family residential real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties. These loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans, and repayment is dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. For example, if the cash flow from the borrowers project is reduced as a result of leases not being obtained or renewed, the borrowers ability to repay the loan may be impaired. 32 Table of Contents Commercial and five or more family residential real estate loans also expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as residential real estate. In addition, many of our commercial and five or more family residential real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. Such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment. If we foreclose on a commercial and five or more family residential real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Additionally, commercial and five or more family residential real estate loans generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our commercial and five or more family residential real estate loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. As of December 31, 2012, our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $265.8 million, or 30.4% of our total originated loan portfolio. Our real estate construction and land development loans are based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Construction lending can involve a higher level of risk than other types of lending because funds are advanced partially based upon the value of the project, which is uncertain prior to the projects completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs as well as the market value of a completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, our estimates with regards to the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio may vary from actual results. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or refinance the indebtedness. If our estimate of the value of a project at completion proves to be overstated, it may have inadequate security for repayment of the loan and may incur a loss. As of December 31, 2012, our originated real estate construction and land development loans totaled $77.3 million, or 8.8% of our total originated loan portfolio. Of these loans, $25.2 million, or 2.9%, were one-to-four family residential construction related and $52.1 million, or 5.9%, were five-or-more family residential and commercial construction related. Approximately $6.4 million, or 8.3%, of our total originated construction loans were nonperforming at December 31, 2012. Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio. Lending money is a substantial part of our business. Every loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things:  cash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed;  the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral, in the case of a collateralized loan;  the character and creditworthiness of a particular borrower;  changes in economic and industry conditions; and  the duration of the loan. We maintain an allowance for loan losses on our loans, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged against income, which we believe is appropriate to provide for probable losses in our loan portfolio. The amount of this allowance is determined by our management through a periodic review and consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to:  our general reserve, based on our historical default and loss experience; 33 Table of Contents  our specific reserve, based on our evaluation of nonperforming loans and their underlying collateral or discounted cash flows; and  current macroeconomic factors and managements expectation of future events. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. If current weak conditions in the housing and real estate markets continue, we expect we will continue to experience further delinquencies and credit losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If our allowance for loan losses is not adequate, we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge-off additional loans, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our capital. For the year ended December 31, 2012 we recorded a total provision for loan losses of $2.0 million compared to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The provision related to the originated portfolio was $695,000 and $5.2 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our provision for loan losses on purchased loans was $1.3 million and $9.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We also recorded net loan charge-offs of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net charge-offs related to the originated portfolio was $3.9 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Recently, we have been experiencing decreasing loan delinquencies and decreasing loan charge-offs. Generally, our nonperforming loans and assets reflect operating difficulties of individual borrowers resulting from weakness in the local economy. The deterioration in the general economy has been a significant contributing factor to our current level of delinquencies and nonperforming loans. The economy has significantly impacted our commercial and industrial loan portfolio, which represented 36.6% of our nonaccrual originated loans at December 31, 2012. Slower sales and excess inventory in the housing market has been the primary cause of the increase in foreclosures for one-to-four family residential construction loans, which represented 24.6% of our nonperforming originated loans at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012 our total nonperforming originated loans were $12.5 million, or 1.28% of total originated loans, compared to $23.3 million or 2.57% of total originated loans at December 31, 2011. Moreover, if weak economic conditions persist, we expect that we could experience significantly higher delinquencies and loan charge-offs. As a result, we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. The current economic condition in the market areas we serve may continue to adversely impact our earnings and could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Substantially all of our loans are to businesses and individuals in the states of Washington and Oregon, and a continuing decline in the economies of our primary market areas of the Pacific Northwest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In particular, in the current downturn, the Puget Sound and Portland, Oregon areas have experienced substantial home price declines, increased foreclosures and above-average unemployment rates. Many large Pacific Northwest businesses have implemented substantial employee layoffs and scaled back plans for future growth. The Yakima Valley also has similarly experienced an increased unemployment rate and a continued decline in housing prices. 34 Table of Contents Continued weakness or a further deterioration in economic conditions in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations:  loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;  we may increase our provision for loan losses;  demand for our products and services may decline possibly resulting in a decrease in our total loans;  collateral for loans made may decline further in value, exposing us to increased risk of loss on existing loans;  the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and  the amount of our deposits may decrease and the composition of our deposits may be adversely affected. If the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions becomes impaired, our earnings and capital could be reduced. Accounting standards require that we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. Under purchase accounting, if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of its net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirers balance sheet as goodwill. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, our goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. Such evaluation is based on a variety of factors, including the quoted price of our common stock, market prices of common stock of other banking organizations, common stock trading multiples, discounted cash flows, and data from comparable acquisitions. At December 31, 2012, we had goodwill with a carrying amount of $13.0 million. Declines in our stock price or a prolonged weakness in the operating environment of the financial services industry may result in a future impairment charge. Any such impairment charge could have a material adverse affect on our operating results and capital. Fluctuating interest rates can adversely affect our profitability. Our profitability is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference (or spread) between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread, and, in turn, our profitability. The tightening of available liquidity could limit our ability to replace deposits and fund loan demand, which could adversely affect our earnings and capital levels. A tightening of the credit markets and the inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits and fund continued loan growth may negatively affect asset growth and, consequently, our earnings capability and capital levels. In addition to any deposit growth, maturity of investment securities and loan payments, we rely from time to time on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle, or FHLB, and certain other wholesale funding sources to fund loans and replace deposits. In the event of a further downturn in the economy, these additional funding sources could be negatively affected which could limit the funds available to us. Our liquidity position could be significantly constrained if we were unable to access funds from the FHLB or other wholesale funding sources. 35 Table of Contents Increases in deposit insurance premiums and special FDIC assessments will negatively impact our earnings. The Dodd-Frank Act established 1.35% of total insured deposits as the minimum reserve ratio. The FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet this ratio by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2020, which has increased assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former minimum of 1.15%. The FDIC has not announced how it will implement this offset. In addition to the statutory minimum ratio, the FDIC must set a designated reserve ratio, which may exceed the statutory minimum. The FDIC has set 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted final regulations under which insurance premiums are based on an institutions total assets minus its tangible equity instead of its deposits. While our FDIC insurance premiums initially may be reduced by these regulations, it is possible that our future insurance premiums will increase under the final regulations. Our growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high; further, the resulting dilution of our equity may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. At some point we may need to raise additional capital to support continued internal growth and growth through acquisitions. Our ability to raise additional capital, however, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. If we are able to raise capital it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. Accordingly, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital when needed. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or from the perception that such sales could occur. Our board of directors is authorized generally to cause us to issue additional common stock, as well as series of preferred stock, without any action on the part of our shareholders except as may be required under the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. In addition, the board has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our business and other terms. In addition, if we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected. Continued deterioration in the financial position of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle may result in future impairment losses of our investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock. At December 31, 2012, we owned $5.5 million of stock of the FHLB of Seattle. As a condition of membership at the FHLB, we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of FHLB stock. Our stock purchase requirement is based, in part, upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the FHLB and is calculated in accordance with the Capital Plan of the FHLB. Our FHLB stock has a par value of $100, is carried 36 Table of Contents at cost, and is subject to impairment testing. In December 2008, the FHLB has announced that it had a risk-based capital deficiency under the regulations of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or the FHFA, its primary regulator, and that it would suspend future dividends and the repurchase and redemption of outstanding common stock. As a result, the FHLB has not paid a dividend since the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, the FHLB communicated that it believes the calculation of risk-based capital under the current rules of the FHFA significantly overstates the market risk of the FHLBs private-label mortgage-backed securities in the current market environment and that it has enough capital to cover the risks reflected in its balance sheet. As a result, we have not recorded an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in FHLB stock. In addition, on October 25, 2010, the FHLB received a consent order from the FHFA, which it has been operating under since that time. In September 2012, the FHLB of Seattle announced that its financial condition had improved, that it continues to address the requirements of the Consent Agreement and that it met all minimum financial metrics required under the Consent Agreement. Further, the FHLB of Seattle reported that the FHFA had reclassified the FHLB of Seattle to be adequately capitalized and that the FHFA had authorized the FHLB Seattle to repurchase up to $25 million of excess capital stock per quarter at par ($100 per share) as long as its financial condition does not deteriorate. Any dividends on, or repurchases of, the FHLB of Seattle stock continue to require consent of the FHFA. After receiving FHFA approval, the FHLB of Seattle repurchased $24.1 million in excess capital stock in late September 2012. We will continue to monitor the financial condition of the FHLB as it relates to, among other things, the recoverability of our investment. New or changing tax, accounting, and regulatory rules and interpretations could significantly impact strategic initiatives, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. The financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to benefit a companys stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institutions allowance for loan losses. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against us could require us to devote significant time and resources to defending our business and may lead to penalties that materially affect us. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. For information regarding the significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us, see Item 1. BusinessSupervision and Regulation. We rely heavily on the proper functioning of our technology. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third-party service providers for much of our communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology. If any of our third-party service providers experience financial, operational or technological difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required 37 Table of Contents to locate alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality, as found in our existing systems, without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business. Changes in accounting standards may affect how we record and report our performance. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we report and record our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in a retrospective adjustment to prior financial statements. We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects. Competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the community banking industry where we conduct our business. The process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, loan origination, finance, administrative, marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel. In particular, our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of key executives, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Brian L. Vance, and certain other employees. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business. ITEM 1B.
