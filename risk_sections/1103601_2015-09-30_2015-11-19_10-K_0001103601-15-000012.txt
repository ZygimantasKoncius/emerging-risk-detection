Item 1A. Risk Factors (continued) The construction and operation of WGL Midstream’s pipeline assets involves the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to pipeline integrity, fuel supply or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages, construction delays or cost overruns, and shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor. Because these assets are interconnected with facilities of third parties, the operation of these facilities could also be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties. These events could delay the in-service date of WGL Midstream’s projects or disrupt operations on these projects, which could have an adverse effect on its financial results.Delays in federal government budget appropriations may negatively impact WGL Energy Systems’ earnings.The Energy Efficiency and Energy Management operations of WGL Energy Systems are sensitive to federal government agencies’ receipt of funding in a timely manner. A significant portion of WGL Energy Systems revenues is derived from implementing projects related to energy efficiency and energy conservation measures for federal government agencies in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. A delay in funding for these federal agencies directly impacts completion of ongoing projects and may harm WGL Energy Systems’ ability to obtain new contracts, which may negatively impact earnings. 23WGL Holdings, Inc.Washington Gas Light CompanyPart IITEM 1B.
