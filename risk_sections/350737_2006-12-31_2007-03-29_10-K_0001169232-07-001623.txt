Item 1A. Risk factors Concentration of credit risk - Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. Our five largest customers represented approximately 59%, 43% and 55% of consolidated gross revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004; and 57% and 26% of consolidated accounts receivable at December 31, 2006 and 2005 respectively. We have had a longstanding relationship with each of these entities and have always collected open receivable balances. However, the loss of any of these customers could have an adverse impact on our operations. Concentration of cash - At various times of the year, and at December 31, 2006, we had a concentration of cash in one bank in excess of prevailing insurance offered through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation at such institution. Management does not consider the excess deposits to be a significant risk.
