ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. Our annual and quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which may be beyond our control. These factors may include, but are not necessarily limited to: Ø adverse changes in general economic conditions Ø the level and timing of customer orders and the accuracy of their forecasts Ø the level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and associated fixed costs Ø price competition Ø market acceptance of our customers' products Ø business conditions in our customers' end markets Ø our level of experience manufacturing a particular product Ø change in the sales mix of our customers Ø the efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and fixed assets Ø fluctuations in cost and availability of materials Ø the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders Ø changes in cost and availability of labor and components Ø our effectiveness in managing the manufacturing process. The EMS industry is affected by the condition of the United States and global economies, both of which are influenced by world events. An economic slowdown, particularly in the industries we serve, may result in our customers reducing their forecasts. The demand for our services could weaken, which in turn could substantially influence our sales, capacity utilization, margins and financial results. Historically, we have seen periods, such as in fiscal 2002-2003, when EMS industry sales were adversely affected by a slowdown in wireless/networking and wireless infrastructure sectors as a result of reduced end-market demand and in 2008-2010 when reduced availability of capital to fund existing and emerging technologies forced some firms to contract and some industry consolidation. WE DEPEND ON A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, AND IF WE LOSE ANY OF THESE CUSTOMERS OUR SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY. A relatively small number of customers is responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, our five largest customers accounted for 45%, 55% and 62% of net sales, respectively. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, our single largest customer in each year accounted for 14%, 15% and 21% of net sales, respectively. The percentage of IEC's sales to its major customers may fluctuate from period to period, and our principal customers have varied from period to period. Going forward our principal customers may not continue to purchase services from us at the current levels. WE DEPEND ON THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY, WHICH HISTORICALLY PRODUCES TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED PRODUCTS WITH SHORT LIFE CYCLES. Factors affecting the electronics industry in general could seriously harm our customers and, as a result, us. These factors may include, but may not be limited to: Ø the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards, which result in short product life cycles Ø the inability of our customers to develop and market their products, some of which are new and untested Ø the potential that our customers' products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers' products to gain widespread commercial acceptance Ø periods of significantly decreased demand in our customers' markets 8 OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS. Current global economic and financial market conditions, including the continued threat of disruption in the credit markets and the potential for a lagging recovery from the global economic recession, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These conditions may also materially impact our customers and suppliers. Economic and financial market conditions that adversely affect our customers may cause them to terminate existing purchase orders or to reduce the volume of products they purchase from us in the future. We may have significant balances owing from customers that operate in cyclical industries and under leveraged conditions that may impair the collectability of those receivables. Failure to collect a significant portion of those receivables could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Adverse economic and financial credit terms extended to us by our suppliers, such as shortening the required payment period for outstanding accounts payable or reducing the maximum amount of trade credit available to us could significantly affect our liquidity and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and financial market conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our operating results could be adversely affected. FAILURE TO MANAGE GROWTH AND CONTRACTION, IF ANY, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Since late 2006, we have been focused on expanding our operations and have added many new employees. These actions have resulted in additional costs and start-up inefficiencies. If we are unable to effectively manage the currently anticipated growth or if the anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected. ENERGY PRICE INCREASES MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Certain of the components used in our manufacturing activities are petroleum-based. In addition, we, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources (including oil) in our transportation activities. Over the past several years, energy prices have experienced significant volatility. Increasing energy prices have resulted in an increase to our raw material costs and transportation costs. In addition, the transportation costs of certain of our suppliers and customers have increased, and some of these increased costs may be passed along to us. We may not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs. In addition, any increase in our product prices may reduce our future customer orders and profitability. START-UP COSTS AND INEFFICIENCIES RELATED TO NEW OR TRANSFERRED PROGRAMS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. Start-up costs, the management of labor and equipment resources in connection with establishing new programs and new customer relationships, the need to estimate required resources, and the timing of obtaining those resources in advance of production, can adversely affect our operating results. If new programs or new customer relationships are terminated or delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected, particularly in the near term, as we may not be able to recoup our start-up costs or quickly replace anticipated new program revenues. MOST OF THE CUSTOMERS IN OUR INDUSTRY DO NOT COMMIT TO LONG-TERM PRODUCTION SCHEDULES, WHICH CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO SCHEDULE PRODUCTION. Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for any number of reasons that are beyond our control. Cancellations, reductions or delay by a significant customer or by a group of customers could adversely affect our operating results and working capital levels. Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred and may occur again. The volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to: Ø variation in demand for our customers' products in their end markets Ø actions taken by our customers to manage their inventory Ø product design changes by our customers Ø changes in our customers' manufacturing strategy Ø reduced demand for our customers' products Due in part to these factors, most of our customers do not commit to firm, long-term production schedules. We make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements, including: Ø deciding on the levels of business that we will seek Ø production schedules Ø component procurement commitments Ø equipment requirements Ø personnel needs Ø other resource requirements 9 The short-term nature of our customers’ commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate and forecast the future requirements of those customers. Since many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand can adversely affect our revenue and operating results. INCREASED COMPETITION MAY RESULT IN DECREASED DEMAND OR REDUCED PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. The EMS industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition. We may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to other EMS providers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location. As a result, other EMS providers may have a competitive advantage. Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us. We also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce the price of their products or services and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing. Any of these may cause a decline in our sales, loss of market acceptance of our products or services, profit margin compression, or loss of market share. THE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED OPERATIONS MAY POSE DIFFICULTIES FOR US. We completed acquisitions of GTC and Celmet in December 2009 and July 2010, respectively. We may continue to acquire additional businesses in the future. These acquisitions and future acquisitions involve risks, which may include, but not be limited to: Ø integration and management of operations Ø retention of key personnel Ø integration of information systems, internal procedures, accounts receivable as well as management, financial and operational controls Ø retention of customer base of acquired businesses Ø diversion of management’s attention from other ongoing business concerns Ø exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve expected levels of profitability or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our operating results. IF WE DO NOT MANAGE OUR BUSINESS EFFECTIVELY, OUR PROFITABILITY COULD DECLINE. To manage our business effectively we must continually improve our operational, financial and management information systems; develop the skills of our managers and supervisors; and train, motivate and manage our other employees. Our failure to effectively do so could adversely affect our operating results. WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS FOR COMPONENTS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. A SHORTAGE OF THESE COMPONENTS OR AN INCREASE IN THEIR PRICE COULD INTERRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. Much of our net revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing for which we provide materials procurement. Some of our customer agreements permit periodic adjustments to pricing based on increases or decreases in component prices and other factors. However, we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re-pricing dates or, if such re-pricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of a particular customer agreement. As a result, certain component price increases could adversely affect our operating results. Many of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are available from a limited number of suppliers. In response to supply shortages, some of these components are from time to time subject to allocation limits. In some cases, supply shortages or delayed deliveries could substantially curtail production of those assemblies requiring a limited component which could contribute to an increase in our inventory levels. There have been times when component shortages have been prevalent in our industry, and such shortages may recur. An increase in economic activity could result in shortages if manufacturers of components do not adequately anticipate increased order volume or have previously cut back their production capabilities excessively in response to reduced activity. World events, armed conflict, governmental regulation and epidemics could also affect our supply chain, leading to an inability to obtain sufficient components on a timely basis, adversely affecting relationships with our customers. 10 In addition, due to the specialized nature of some components and our customers’ products specifications, we may be required to use sole source suppliers for certain components. Such sole source suppliers may encounter financial difficulties, which could preclude them from delivering components on time, or at all. OUR TURNKEY MANUFACTURING SERVICES INVOLVE INVENTORY RISK. Most of our services are provided on a turnkey basis, whereby we purchase some or all of the materials required for product assembly and manufacturing. These services involve greater resource investment and inventory risk management than consignment services, where the customer provides materials. For example, in our turnkey operations, we must frequently order parts and supplies in minimum lot sizes that may be larger than the quantity of product ultimately ordered for our customers. Customers' cancellation or reduction of orders could result in additional expense to us. While most of our customer agreements typically include provisions which require customers to reimburse us for excess inventory specifically ordered to meet their forecasts, if we are not reimbursed, we could have excess inventory and/or cancellation or return charges from our suppliers. Accordingly, for turnkey products various component price increases and inventory obsolescence could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we provide inventory management programs for some of our customers under which we reduced required to hold and manage finished goods inventories. This inventory management program may lead to higher finished goods inventory levels, reduced inventory turns and increased financial exposure to some customers. These customers will generally have contractual obligations to purchase such managed inventories from us, however, we may remain subject to the risk of enforcing those obligations. PRODUCTS WE MANUFACTURE MAY CONTAIN DEFECTS IN WORKMANSHIP, WHICH COULD RESULT IN REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS AGAINST US. We manufacture products to our customers' specifications, which are highly complex and may contain design or manufacturing errors or failures. Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur. Defects in the products we manufacture, whether caused by a customer design, workmanship or component failure or error, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders and we may suffer adverse reputational effects as a result of these circumstances. In addition, these defects may result in product liability claims against us. Even if customers or component suppliers are responsible for the defects, they may be unwilling or unable to assume responsibility for any costs associated with product failure. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR ENGINEERING, TECHNOLOGICAL AND MANUFACTURING COMPETITVE ADVANTAGE. The markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to: Ø hire and retain qualified engineering and technical personnel Ø maintain and enhance our technological leadership Ø develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs Although we believe that our operations provide the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, there is no certainty that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or uncompetitive; or we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive. The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment, which could adversely affect our operating results, as could our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers' changing technological requirements. FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL AND OTHER SKILLED EMPLOYEES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Our continued success depends to a large extent on our ability to recruit, train, and retain skilled employees, particularly executive management and technical employees. The competition for these individuals is significant; hence the loss of the services of certain of these key employees or an inability to attract or retain qualified employees could negatively impact us. We have employment agreements with W. Barry Gilbert, our Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey T. Schlarbaum, our President and Donald S. Doody, our Executive Vice President. We do not have employment agreements or non-competition agreements with any of our other key employees. 11 THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CURRENT AND FUTURE GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS COULD IMPARE OUR OPERATIONS OR CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE. We are subject to a variety of United States government regulations that control the export and import of defense-related articles and services, as well as federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to conflict metals and environmental, waste management, health and safety matters relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process. If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production. While we are not currently aware of any violations, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant compliance related expenses. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING, INVESTORS COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Under the provisions of Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended by the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to perform an evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) and to report our evaluation on effectiveness in Form 10-K. We continue our ongoing efforts to comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, this could lead to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, adversely affecting the value of our common stock. THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR DEBT CONTAIN VARIOUS COVENANTS THAT IMPACT THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS. The agreements and instruments governing our secured bank credit facility and other existing debt contain various restrictive covenants that, among other things, require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios including, among others, limitations on the amount available under our Revolver relative to the borrowing base, limits on capital expenditures, and minimum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, rent payments and stock compensation expense (“EBITDARS”) and restrict our ability to: Ø incur debt Ø incur or maintain liens Ø make acquisitions of businesses or entities Ø make investments, including loans, guarantees and advances Ø engage in mergers, consolidations or certain sales of assets Ø engage in transactions with affiliates Ø pay dividends or engage in stock redemptions or repurchases Our bank credit facilities are secured by a general security agreement attached to the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, a pledge of the Company’s equity interest in its subsidiaries, a negative pledge on the Company’s real property, and a guarantee by the Company’s subsidiaries. Our ability to comply with covenants contained in our secured bank credit facilities and other existing debt may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. While we are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants, our failure to comply in the future could result in an acceleration of our primary indebtedness and cross-defaults under subordinate indebtedness, causing a material adverse effect on our financial condition. OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE DUE TO FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. Our common stock is traded on the NYSE Amex. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future, based on a variety of factors, including future announcements concerning us or our key customers or competitors, government regulations, litigation, fluctuations in quarterly operating results, or general conditions in the EMS industry.
