Item 1A. Risk Factors In evaluating our business, every investor should carefully consider the following risks. Our business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. The Telecommunications Industry Has Experienced Increased Competition. Although we have historically experienced limited wireline telephone competition in many of our RLEC territories, the market for telecommunications services is highly competitive. Certain competitors benefit from brand recognition and financial, personnel, marketing and other resources that are significantly greater than ours. We cannot predict the number of competitors that will emerge, especially as a result of existing or new federal and state regulatory or legislative actions. Increased competition from existing and new entities could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and cash flow. In all of our markets, we face competition from wireless carriers, including the potential for customers to export existing wireline telephone numbers to wireless services. As wireless carriers continue to build-out their networks and add products and services aimed at the fixed wireless market, we may experience increased competition, which could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and cash flow. The current and potential competitors in our RLEC territories include cable television companies; competitive local exchange carriers and other providers of telecommunications and data services, including internet and VoIP service providers; wireless carriers; satellite television companies; alternate access providers; neighboring incumbent local exchange carriers; long distance companies and electric utilities that may provide services competitive with those products and services that we provide or intend to provide. In Maine and New Hampshire, our competitive local exchange carrier operations may encounter a change in the competitive landscape that would impact its continued ability to grow and/or retain customers, sustain current pricing plans, and control the cost of access to incumbent carrier customers. Although our long distance operations have historically been modest in relation to our competitors, we have expanded our long distance business within our territories, primarily through bundling long distance with other local services and providing a single bill for these services. Our existing long distance competitors, including those with significantly greater resources than us, could respond to such initiatives and new competitors may enter the market with attractive offerings. There can be no assurance that our local services revenue, including long distance services, will not decrease in the future as competition and/or the cost of providing services increase. 8 We May Not be Able to Integrate New Technologies and Provide New Services in a Cost-Efficient Manner. The telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology, frequent new service introductions and evolving industry standards. We cannot predict the effect of these changes on our competitive position, our capital expenditure requirements, our profitability or the industry generally. Technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our networks and require additional capital expenditures or the procurement of additional products that could be expensive and time consuming. In addition, new products and services arising out of technological developments may reduce the attractiveness of our services. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological advances or fail to obtain access to new technologies, we could lose customers and be limited in our ability to attract new customers and/or sell new services to our existing customers. In addition, delivery of new services in a cost-efficient manner depends upon many factors, and we may not generate the revenue anticipated from such services. Disruptions in Our Networks and Infrastructure May Cause Us to Lose Customers and Incur Additional Expenses. To be successful, we will need to continue to provide our customers with reliable and timely service over our networks. We face the following risks to our networks and infrastructure: ● our territories could have significant weather events which physically damage access lines; ● our rural geography creates the risk of security breaches, break-ins and sabotage; ● power surges and outages, computer viruses or hacking, and software or hardware defects which are beyond our control; and ● unusual spikes in demand or capacity limitations in our or our suppliers’ networks. Disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers and/or incur expenses, and thereby adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow. In addition, the APSC, MPUC, MDTC, MPSC, NHPUC and/or WVPSC could require us to issue credits on customer bills for such service interruptions, further impacting revenue and cash flow. Wholesale network contracts could impose service level penalties for service disruptions. Our Business is Geographically Concentrated and Dependent on Regional Economic Conditions. Our business is conducted primarily in north central Alabama, Maine, New Hampshire, western Massachusetts, central Missouri and southern West Virginia and, accordingly, our business is dependent upon the general economic conditions of these regions. There can be no assurance that future economic conditions in these regions, including as a result of the recent global economic recession, will not impact demand for our services or cause residents to relocate to other regions, which may adversely impact our business, revenue and cash flow. Our Success Depends on a Small Number of Key Personnel. Our success depends on the personal efforts of a small group of skilled employees and senior management. The rural nature of our service area provides for a smaller pool of skilled telephone employees and increases the challenge of hiring employees. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. We Provide Services to Our Customers Over Access Lines, and if We Lose Access Lines, Our Business and Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected. Our business generates revenue by delivering voice and data services over access lines. We have experienced net voice access line loss in our RLEC territories due to challenging economic conditions, wireless substitution, loss of second lines when we sell data access lines for internet and increased competition. RLEC voice access lines declined by approximately 5.7% during 2010. We expect to continue to experience net voice access line loss in our rural markets, which will be partially offset by increases in data access lines. If voice access line losses are not substantially offset by data access line gains, it could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 9 Our Performance Is Subject to a Number of Other Economic and Non-Economic Factors, Which We May Not Be Able to Predict Accurately. There are factors that may be beyond our control that could affect our operations and business. Such factors include adverse changes in the conditions in the specific markets for our products and services, the conditions in the broader market for telecommunications services and the conditions in the domestic and global economies, generally. Although our performance is affected by the general condition of the economy, not all of our services are affected equally. Voice access revenue is generally linked to relatively consistent variables such as population changes, housing starts and general economic activity levels in the areas served. Data access and cable television revenue is generally related to more variable factors such as changing levels of discretionary spending on entertainment and the adoption of e-commerce and other on-line activities by our current or prospective customers. It is not possible for management to accurately predict all of these factors and the impact of such factors on our performance. Changes in the competitive, technological and regulatory environments may also impact our ability to increase revenue and/or earnings from the provision of local wireline services. We may therefore have to place increased emphasis on developing and realizing revenue through the provision of new and enhanced services with higher growth potential. In such a case, there is a risk that these revenue sources as well as our cost savings efforts through further efficiency gains will not grow or develop at a fast enough pace to offset slowing growth in local services. It is also possible that as we invest in new technologies and services, demand for those new services may not develop. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our service offerings through the development of new services, and our efforts to do so may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Changes in the Regulation of the Telecommunications Industry Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Revenue or Cash Flow. We operate in an industry that is regulated at the federal, state and local level. The majority of our revenue has historically been supported by and subject to regulation. Certain federal and state regulations and local franchise requirements have been, are currently, and may in the future be, the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals. Such proceedings may relate to, among other things, the rates we may charge for our local, network access and other services, the manner in which we offer and bundle our services, the terms and conditions of interconnection, federal and state universal service funds (including USF HCL), unbundled network elements and resale rates, and could change the manner in which telecommunications companies operate. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or the impact they will have on our business, revenue and cash flow. Governmental Authorities Could Decrease Network Access Charges or Rates for Local Services, Which Would Adversely Affect Our Revenue. Approximately 9.9% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 was derived from interstate network access charges paid by long distance carriers for use of our facilities to originate and terminate interstate and intrastate telephone calls. The interstate network access rates that we can charge are regulated by the FCC, and the intrastate network access rates that we can charge are regulated by the regulatory commissions in each state in which we operate. Those rates may change from time to time. The FCC has reformed and continues to reform the federal network access charge system, including proposed changes intended to promote deployment of broadband data services. It is unknown at this time what additional changes, if any, the FCC or state regulatory commissions may adopt. Such regulatory developments could adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow. The local services rates and intrastate access fees charged by our rural local exchange carriers are regulated by state regulatory commissions which have the power to grant and revoke authorization to companies to provide telecommunications services and to impose other conditions and penalties. If we fail to comply with regulations set forth by the state regulatory commissions, we may face revocation of our authorizations in a state or other conditions and penalties. It is possible that new plans would require us to reduce our rates, forego future rate increases, provide greater features as part of our basic service plan or limit our rates for certain offerings. We cannot predict the ultimate impact, if any, of such changes on our business, revenue and cash flow. Our RLECs operating in Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri and West Virginia charge rates for local services and intrastate access service based in part upon a rate-of-return authorized by the state regulatory commissions. These authorized rates are subject to audit at any time and may be reduced if the regulatory commission finds them excessive. If any company is ordered to reduce its rates or if its applications to increase rates are denied or delayed, our business, revenue and cash flow may be negatively impacted. NECA may file revisions to its average schedule formula each year which are subject to FCC approval. Five of our subsidiaries participate in average schedule rates. The level of funding and future changes in the average schedule settlement rates are not currently known with certainty and could be higher or lower than the current average schedule settlement rates. 10 A Reduction in Universal Service Fund High Cost Loop Support Would Adversely Affect Our Business, Revenue and Cash Flow. Six of our RLECs receive federal USF HCL revenue to support their high cost of operations. Such support payments represented approximately 4.5% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010, and were based upon each participating rural local exchange carrier’s average cost per loop as compared to the national average cost per loop. These support payments fluctuate based upon the historical costs of our participating rural local exchange carriers as compared to the national average cost per loop. Each year, the average cost per loop has increased, putting pressure on the USF HCL funds received by our companies to the extent that our costs do not increase at the same rate. If our participating rural local exchange carriers are unable to receive support from the USF HCL, or if such support is reduced, our business, revenue and cash flow would be negatively affected. On May 16, 2006, the FCC released an order extending the current high-cost universal support rules until the FCC adopts changes, if any, to these rules. The outcome of any future FCC proceedings and other regulatory or legislative changes could affect the amount of USF HCL support that we receive, and could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and cash flow. If a wireless or other telecommunications carrier receives ETC status in our service areas or even outside of our service areas, the amount of support we receive from the USF HCL could decline under current rules, and under some proposed USF HCL rule changes, could be significantly reduced. USAC serves as the administrative agent to collect data and distribute funds for USF. In 2006, it began conducting High Cost Beneficiary audits, designed to ensure compliance with FCC rules and program requirements and to assist in program compliance. Carriers are chosen from a random sample of each type of ETC, including average schedule and cost companies, incumbents and competitors, and rural and non-rural, from various states. Audits are designed to ensure proper designation of a carrier as ETC, accuracy of data submissions, documentation of accounting procedures, physical inventory of assets, true-up of projected data, and samples of detailed documentation (e.g., invoices, continuing property records). Audits of Blountsville, Hopper, Granby, Otelco Telephone and Brindlee Mountain Telephone, initiated during 2007 and 2008, have been completed and no material action is pending. These audits were conducted widely across our industry as directed by the FCC. There is no guidance on the likelihood of the continuation of the audit process currently available. If We Were to Lose Our Protected Status Under Interconnection Rules, We Would Incur Additional Administrative and Regulatory Expenses and Face More Competition. As a “rural telephone company” under the Communications Act, each of our RLECs is exempt from the obligation to lease its unbundled facilities to competitive local exchange carriers, to offer retail services at wholesale prices for resale, to permit competitive co-location at its facilities and to comply with certain other requirements applicable to larger incumbent local exchange carriers. However, we eventually may be required to comply with these requirements in some or all of our service areas if: (i) we receive a bona fide request from a telecommunications carrier; and (ii) the state regulatory commissions, as applicable, determine that it is in the public interest to impose such requirements. In addition, we may be required to comply with some or all of these requirements in order to achieve greater pricing flexibility from state regulators. If we are required to comply with these requirements, we could incur additional administrative and regulatory expenses and face more competition which could adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow. Our Current Dividend Policy May Negatively Impact Our Ability to Maintain or Expand Our Network Infrastructure and Finance Capital Expenditures or Operations. Our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which a significant portion of the cash generated by our business in excess of operating needs, interest and principal payments on indebtedness, and capital expenditures sufficient to maintain our network infrastructure, would in general be distributed as regular quarterly cash dividends to the holders of our common stock and not retained by us. As a result, we may not have sufficient cash to fund our operations in the event of a significant business downturn, finance growth of our network or unanticipated capital expenditure needs. We may have to forego growth opportunities or capital expenditures that would otherwise be necessary or desirable if we do not find alternative sources of financing or if we do not modify our dividend policy. If we do not have sufficient cash for these purposes, our financial condition and our business will suffer or our board of directors may change our dividend policy. We Are Subject to Restrictive Debt Covenants That Limit Our Business Flexibility By Imposing Operating and Financial Restrictions on Our Operations. The agreements governing our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions prohibit or limit, among other things: ● the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the issuance of preferred stock and certain redeemable capital stock; 11 ● the making of certain types of restricted payments, including investments and acquisitions; ● specified sales of assets; ● specified transactions with affiliates; ● the creation of a number of liens; ● consolidations, mergers and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets; and ● our ability to change the nature of our business.
