ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY WE DEPEND ON OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE LOSS OF THIS INDIVIDUAL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Our Company is completely dependent on Yazhong Liao, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director. As of the date of this Report, Yazhong Liao was our sole executive officer and director. The loss of his services would significantly and adversely affect our business. We have no life insurance on the life of Yazhong Liao. THE COSTS TO MEET OUR REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY SUBJECT TO THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY RESULT IN US HAVING INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS OR EVEN TO MEET ROUTINE BUSINESS OBLIGATIONS. Since having become subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal and a host of other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements. These obligations will reduce our ability and resources to fund other aspects of our business and may prevent us from meeting our normal business obligations. 5 RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COMMON STOCK TRADING ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD MAY BE VOLATILE AND SPORADIC, WHICH COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS TO RESELL THEIR SHARES. Our common shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board service of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common shares for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Bulletin Board is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Bulletin Board is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like the American Stock Exchange. Accordingly, our shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares. OUR STOCK IS A PENNY STOCK. TRADING OF OUR STOCK MAY BE RESTRICTED BY THE SEC'S PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS AND FINRA'S SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER'S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK. Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules; which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common shares. FINRA'S SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS MAY ALSO LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER'S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK. In addition to the "penny stock" rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (see above for a discussion of penny stock rules), FINRA rules require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common shares, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. ONE SHAREHOLDER OWNS 85.76% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, WHICH LIMITS OTHER SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF ANY SHAREHOLDER VOTE. Our sole executive officer and a director beneficially owns 85.76% of our outstanding common stock as of July 26, 2013. Under our Certificate of Incorporation and the laws of the State of Nevada, the vote of a majority of the shares voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present is generally required to approve most shareholder action. As a result, he is able to control the outcome of shareholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation or proposed mergers or other significant corporate transactions. 6 CERTAIN COMPANY ACTIONS AND THE INTERESTS OF STOCKHOLDERS MAY DIFFER. The voting control of the Company could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or another change-of-control transaction that could be beneficial to stockholders. As a result, the value of stock could be harmed. WE HAVE NEVER PAID A DIVIDEND ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING ANY IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We have not paid a cash dividend on our common stock to date, and we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to successfully develop one or more properties and generate revenue from operations. Notwithstanding, we will likely elect to retain earnings, if any, to finance our growth. Future dividends may also be limited by bank loan agreements or other financing instruments that we may enter into in the future. The declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. WE HAVE NOT VOLUNTARILY IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MEASURES, IN THE ABSENCE OF WHICH, SHAREHOLDERS MAY HAVE MORE LIMITED PROTECTIONS AGAINST INTERESTED DIRECTOR TRANSACTIONS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SIMILAR MATTERS. Recent U.S. legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures required under the rules of national securities exchanges and NASDAQ are those that address board of directors' independence, audit committee oversight and the adoption of a code of ethics. We have not yet adopted any of these corporate governance measures and, since our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ, we are not required to do so. It is possible that if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, shareholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, in the absence of nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions. ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
