Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to the following risk factors, among others, in addition to the information (including disclosures relative to forward-looking statements) set forth elsewhere in this report. Risk Factors Relating to American Safety Insurance A downgrade in our A.M. Best rating or increased capitalization requirements could impair our ability to sell insurance policies. Some policyholders are required to obtain insurance coverage from insurance companies that have an A- (Excellent) rating or higher from A.M. Best, the most widely recognized insurance company rating agency. Additionally, many producers are prohibited from representing insurance companies that are rated below A- (Excellent) by A.M. Best. In November 2005, A.M. Best reaffirmed its rating of A (Excellent), with a negative outlook on a group basis of American Safety Insurance, including our two U.S. insurance subsidiaries, our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary and our U.S. non-subsidiary risk retention group affiliate. An A (Excellent) rating is assigned to companies that have, in the opinion of A.M. Best, an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. A.M. Best assigned a negative outlook to the rating in September 2004 in response to our reserve development in the second quarter of 2004 because of a concern by A.M. Best with the underwriting results from our core business lines and the potential need for further reserve development in the future. A.M. Best reaffirmed this rating and outlook in November 2005. If A.M. Best requires us to increase our capitalization in order to maintain our rating, and we are unable to raise the required amount of capital to be contributed to our insurance subsidiaries, A.M. Best may downgrade us. A.M. Best assigns ratings that represent an independent opinion of an insurers ability to meet its obligations to policyholders that is of concern primarily to policyholders, insurance brokers and agents and its rating and outlook should not be considered an investment recommendation. Because A.M. Best continually monitors companies with regard to their ratings, our ratings could change at any time, and any downgrade of our current rating could impair our ability to sell insurance policies and, ultimately, our financial condition and operating results. The exclusions and limitations in our policies may not be enforceable. We write our excess and surplus lines policy language to manage our exposure to expanding theories of legal liability like those that have given rise to claims for lead paint, asbestos, mold and construction defects. Many of the policies we issue include exclusions or other conditions that define and limit coverage. In addition, many of our policies limit the period during which a policyholder may bring a claim under the policy, which period in many cases is shorter than the statutory period under which these claims can be brought against our policyholders. While these exclusions and limitations help us assess and control our loss exposure, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or limitation, or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of these exclusions and limitations. This could result in higher than anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increasing the number or size of claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued the insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a policy is issued. The risks we underwrite are concentrated in relatively few industries. Adverse conditions in one of those industries could materiallyimpact our operating results. We focus much of our underwriting on specialty risks in the construction and environmental remediation industries. For the year ended December 31, 2005, approximately 61.6% of our gross premiums written were in these two industries. Accordingly, our operating results could be more exposed to unfavorable changes in business, economic or regulatory conditions and legal precedents affecting these industries than our more diversified competitors. For instance, a change in federal, state or local environmental standards could result in additional claims or losses. Similarly, a significant incident impacting one of the industries in which we operate that has the effect of increasing claims generally (or their settlement value) could negatively impact our operating results. A significant negative incident in one of our core business lines could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. We may respond to market trends based on our assessment of the profitability of certain business opportunities by expanding orcontracting our underwriting activities in certain business lines, which may cause our financial results to be volatile. Although we perform substantial due diligence and risk analysis before entering into a new business line or insuring a new type of risk, and carefully assess the impact of exiting a business line, changing business lines inherently has more risk than remaining in the same business lines over a period of time. Because we actively seek to expand or contract our capacity in the markets we serve in response to factors such as loss experience and premium production, our operating results may experience material fluctuations. If our assessment of the potential to grow underwriting profit in a new business line is more favorable than actual results, our operating results may suffer. Our industry is highly competitive and we may lack the financial resources to compete effectively. We believe that competition in the specialty insurance markets that we target is fragmented and not dominated by one or more competitors. We face competition from several companies, such as insurance companies, reinsurance companies, underwriting agencies, program managers and captive insurance companies. Many of our competitors are significantly larger and possess greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do. We compete on the basis of many factors, including coverage availability, claims management, payment terms, premium rates, policy terms, types of insurance offered, overall financial strength, financial strength ratings and reputation. If any of our competitors offers premium rates, policy terms or types of insurance that are more competitive than ours we could lose business. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate or to establish a competitive position in new markets, our financial condition and operating results would be adversely impacted. Our actual incurred losses may be greater than our reserves. Insurance companies are required to maintain reserves to cover their estimated liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to both reported and incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims. Reserves are estimates at a given time involving actuarial and statistical projections of what we expect to be the cost of the ultimate resolution and administration of claims. These estimates are based on facts and circumstances then known, predictions of future events, estimates of future trends, projected claims frequency and severity, potential judicial expansion of liability precedents, legislative activity and other factors, such as inflation. A full actuarial analysis of our reserves is performed on an annual basis, which may include reserve studies, rate studies and regulatory opinions Notwithstanding these efforts, the establishment of appropriate losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves is an inherently uncertain process, particularly in the environmental remediation industry, construction industry and some of the other industries for which we write policies where extensive historical data may not exist and where claims that have occurred may not be reported to an insurance company for long periods of time. For instance, there is little empirical data for residential construction defect claims and hence, traditional actuarial analysis may be inapplicable or less reliable. Due to these uncertainties, it is possible that ultimate losses could materially exceed our losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves. For example, during the last two years, we experienced development with respect to loss reserves as a result of litigation matters specifically related to our construction lines policies and policies written on runoff lines, which lowered our net earnings and shareholders equity during these periods. To the extent that losses or loss adjustment expenses reserves are estimated in the future to be inadequate, we would have to increase our reserves and incur charges to earnings in the periods in which the reserves are increased, which would adversely impact our financial condition and operating results. For more information on our losses and loss adjustment expenses, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. If we are unable to obtain reinsurance on favorable terms, our ability to write new polices would be adversely affected. Reinsurance is a contractual arrangement under which one insurer (the ceding company) transfers to another insurer (the reinsurer) a portion of the liabilities that the ceding company has assumed under an insurance policy it has issued. Our business continues to involve ceding parts or significant portions of the risks that we underwrite to reinsurers. The availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions that are beyond our control and are factors that could materially impact our financial condition and operating results. There is no certainty that reinsurance will continue to be available in the form or in the amount that we require or, if available, at an affordable cost. The availability of reinsurance is dependent not only on reinsurers reaction to the specific risks that we underwrite, but also events that impact the overall reinsurance industry, such as the recent hurricanes in 2005. If we are unable to maintain or replace our reinsurance, our total loss exposure would increase and, if we were unwilling or unable to assume that increase in exposure, we would be required to mitigate the increase in exposure by writing fewer policies or writing policies with lower limits or different coverage. If we are unable to recover amounts due from our reinsurers our financial condition will be adversely affected. While reinsurance contractually obligates the reinsurer to reimburse us for a portion of our losses, it does not relieve us of our primary financial liability to our insureds. If our reinsurers are either unwilling or unable to pay some or all of the claims made by us on a timely basis, we bear the financial exposure. As a result, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. The total amount of reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2005 was $203.4 million, or 171.7% of shareholders equity for the year ended December 31, 2005. Of this amount, $72.2 million, or approximately 35.5% of the total amount recoverable is collateralized by cash or irrevocable letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral posted by the reinsurer. We purchase reinsurance from reinsurers we believe to be financially sound. We have written reinsurance security procedures that establish financial requirements for reinsurance companies that must be met prior to reinsuring any of the business we write. Among these requirements is a stipulation that reinsurance companies must have an A.M. Best rating of at least A- (Excellent) and a financial size category of Class VIII or greater at the time of writing any reinsurance unless sufficient collateral has been provided at the time we enter into our reinsurance agreement. A financial size category of Class VIII is assigned by A.M. Best to companies with adjusted policyholder surplus of $100 million to $250 million, which, on a statutory basis of accounting, is the amount remaining after all liabilities, including loss reserves, are subtracted from all admitted assets. We have also established an internal reinsurance security committee,, consisting of members of senior management, which meets quarterly to discuss and approve reinsurance security. To protect against our reinsurers inability to satisfy their contractual obligations to us, our reinsurance contracts stipulate a collateral requirement for reinsurance companies that do not meet the financial strength and size requirements described above. These collateral requirements can be met through the issuance of unconditional letters of credit, the establishment and funding of escrow accounts for our benefit or cash advances paid into a segregated account. In the event collateral is not sufficient, there is no certainty that these reinsurers will be able to provide additional capital. We are unable to ensure the credit worthiness of our reinsurers. For example, in 2005 and 2006, as a result of significant adverse loss reserve development, A.M. Best and Standard and Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P) downgraded the financial strength ratings of the insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries of Alea Group Holdings (Bermuda) Ltd., including among others, Alea North American Insurance Company and Alea London Limited (Alea), one of our reinsurers, several times. Subsequently, Alea requested that A.M. Best withdraw all ratings of Alea. A.M. Best currently has assigned a NR-4 (Company Request) to Alea. As of December 31, 2005, our unsecured estimated net exposure to Alea was approximately $8.8 million primarily in our specialty programs. This estimate is based upon our estimates of losses and will not reflect our exposure if our actual losses differ from those estimates. The business we have reinsured with Alea is in run-off, and Alea continues to indemnify us under our reinsurance agreements. We rely on independent insurance agents and brokers to market our products, and their failure to successfully market our productscould impair our growth initiatives and negatively impact our operating results. We market most of our insurance products through approximately 230 independent insurance agents and brokers, which we refer to as producers. These producers are not obligated to promote our products and may sell competitors products. Our profitability depends, in part, on the marketing efforts of these producers and on our ability to offer insurance products and services and maintain financial strength ratings that meet the requirements of our producers and their customers. The failure or inability of producers to market our insurance products successfully would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2005, approximately 45.0% of our gross premiums written for our excess and surplus lines segment (or approximately 28.2% of our aggregate gross premiums written) were produced through two producers (who focus on our construction business line). The loss of one or more of these producers going forward could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We are subject to credit risk in connection with producers that market our products. In accordance with industry practice, when the insured pays premiums for our policies to producers for payment over to us, these premiums are considered to have been paid and, in most cases, the insured is no longer liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we actually have received the premiums. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with the producers with whom we choose to do business. To date, we have not experienced any material losses related to these credit risks. Our growth strategy is dependent on several factors, the failure to achieve any one of which may impair our ability to expand ouroperations or may prevent us from operating profitably. Our growth strategy includes expanding in our existing markets, entering new geographic markets, creating relationships with new producers and developing new insurance products. In order to generate this growth, we are subject to various risks, including risks associated with our ability to: o identify insurable risks not adequately served by the standard insurance market; o maintain adequate levels of capital; o obtain reinsurance on favorable terms; o obtain necessary regulatory approvals when writing on an admitted basis; o attract and retain qualified personnel to manage our expanded operations; and o maintain our financial strength ratings. Any of these factors could affect our growth strategy and may cause our business and operating results to suffer. If we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could bedelayed or hindered. Our future success will depend, in part, upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel. We have employment agreements with three of our executive officers. Our ability to recruit and retain key personnel will depend upon a number of factors, such as our results of operations, business prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategies and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We routinely evaluate opportunities to expand our business through acquisitions of other companies or business lines. There are many risks associated with acquisitions that we may be unable to control. We evaluate potential acquisition opportunities as a means to grow our business. There are a number of risks attendant to any acquisition. These risks include, among others, the difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of an acquired company; potential disruption of our ongoing business; inability to successfully integrate acquired systems and insurance programs into our operations; maintenance of uniform standards, controls and procedures; possible impairment of relationships with employees and insureds of an acquired business as a result of changes in management; and that the acquired business may not produce the level of expected profitability. As a result, the impact of any acquisition on our future performance may not be consistent with original expectations, and may impair our business, financial condition and operating results. We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write profitable new business, retain existing customers and establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses and related expenses. Many factors will affect our capital needs and their amount and timing, including our growth and profitability, our claims experience and the availability of reinsurance, as well as possible acquisition opportunities, market disruptions and other unforeseeable developments. If we have to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on terms that are unfavorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders could result. In any case, those securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of the Common Shares offered hereby. In the case of debt financings, we may be subject to covenants that restrict our ability to freely operate our business. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, we may not have sufficient funds to implement our operating plans and our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Changes in the value of our investment portfolio may have a material impact on our operating results. We derive a significant portion of our net income from our invested assets. As a result, our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio. As of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2005, the fair value of our investment portfolio was $415.5 million and our income derived from these assets was $14.3 million, or 89.2% of our pre-tax earnings. Our investment portfolio is subject to various risks, including: |X|credit risk, which is the risk that our invested assets will decrease in value due to unfavorable changes in the financial prospects or a downgrade in the credit rating of an entity in which we have invested;|X| interest rate risk, which is the risk that our invested assets may decrease due to changes in interest rates; |X| equity price risk, which is the risk that we will incur economic loss due to a decline in equity prices; and |X| duration risk, which is the risk that our invested assets may not adequately match the duration of our insurance liabilities. Our investment portfolio is comprised mostly of fixed-income securities. We do not hedge our investments against interest rate risk and, accordingly, changes in interest rates may result in fluctuations in the value of these investments. Our investment portfolio is invested by a professional management firm in accordance with detailed investment guidelines that stress diversification of risks, conservation of principal and liquidity. If our investment portfolio is not appropriately matched with our insurance and reinsurance liabilities, we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to their maturity at a significant loss in order to cover these liabilities. This might occur, for instance, in the event of a large or unexpected claim. Large investment losses could significantly decrease our asset base, thereby affecting our ability to underwrite new business. For more information about our investment portfolio, see Business?Investments. We rely on our information technology, information processing and telecommunication systems, and the failure of these systems couldmaterially and adversely affect our business. Our business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology, information processing and telecommunications systems. We rely on these systems to support our marketing operations, process new and renewal business, provide customer service, make claims payments, support premium financing activities and facilitate premium collections and policy cancellations. These systems also enable us to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for underwriting and rate development. We have a highly trained staff that is committed to the continual development and maintenance of these systems. However, the failure of these systems could interrupt our operations or materially impact our ability to evaluate and write new business. Because our information technology, information processing and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for this service exceeds capacity or if the third party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business and provide customer service or compromise our ability to pay claims in a timely manner. There can be no guarantee that these systems can effectively support our continued growth. Additionally, some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning does not account for all eventualities, which could adversely affect our business. We are subject to risks related to litigation. From time to time, we are subject to lawsuits and other claims arising out of our insurance and real estate operations. We have responded to the lawsuits we face and, although the outcome of these lawsuits cannot be predicted, we believe that there are meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously contest these claims. Adverse judgments in one or more of these lawsuits could require us to pay significant damage amounts or to change aspects of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, particularly where we have not established an accrual, or a sufficient accrual for those judgments. For information on the material litigation in which we are involved, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations?Legal Proceedings. Risk Factors Related to Taxation We may be subject to U.S. tax, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. American Safety Insurance, its reinsurance subsidiary, American Safety Reinsurance (American Safety Re), and its segregated account captive, American Safety Assurance Ltd. (American Safety Assurance), are organized in Bermuda. American Safety Insurance, American Safety Re and American Safety Assurance are operated in a manner such that none should be subject to U.S. tax (other than U.S. excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring U.S. risks and U.S. withholding tax on some types of U.S. source investment income) because none of these companies should be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. (and, in the case of American Safety Re and American Safety Assurance, to be doing business through a permanent establishment within the U.S.). However, because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. (and what constitutes a permanent establishment under the income tax treaty between the U.S. and Bermuda (the Bermuda Treaty) as well as the entitlement of American Safety Re and American Safety Assurance to treaty benefits), there can be no assurances that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) will not contend successfully that American Safety Insurance, American Safety Re and/or American Safety Assurance is engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. (or that American Safety Re or American Safety Assurance is carrying on business through a permanent establishment in the U.S.). If any of American Safety Insurance, American Safety Re or American Safety Assurance were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the U.S., it could be subject to U.S. corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business, in which case its operating results could be materially adversely affected. See Certain Tax ConsiderationsCertain U.S. Federal Tax ConsiderationsU.S. Taxation of American Safety Insurance and its Bermuda Subsidiaries. If you acquire 10% or more of the Common Shares, you may be subject to taxation under the controlled foreign corporation (CFC)rules. Under certain circumstances, a U.S. 10% shareholder (as defined in Certain Tax ConsiderationsCertain U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsTax Treatment of ShareholdersClassification as a Controlled Foreign Corporation) of a foreign corporation that is a CFC for an uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during a taxable year must include in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes that U.S. 10% shareholders subpart F income, even if the subpart F income is not distributed to that U.S. 10% shareholder. Subpart F income of a foreign insurance corporation typically includes foreign personal holding company income (such as interest, dividends and other types of passive income), as well as insurance and reinsurance income (including underwriting and investment income) attributable to the insurance of risks situated outside the CFCs country of incorporation. We believe that because of the dispersion of our Common Share ownership, provisions in our organizational documents that limit voting power and other factors, no U.S. person who acquires Common Shares directly or indirectly through one or more foreign entities should be required to include our subpart F income in income under the CFC rules of the Code. It is possible that the IRS could challenge the effectiveness of these provisions and that a court could sustain that challenge, in which case your investment could be materially adversely affected. U.S. persons who hold Common Shares may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation at ordinary income rates on their proportionateshare of our related party insurance income (RPII). If the RPII of American Safety Re or American Safety Assurance were to equal or exceed 20% of its gross insurance income in any taxable year and direct or indirect insureds (and persons related to those insureds) own directly or indirectly through entities 20% or more of the voting power or value of American Safety Re or American Safety Assurance, then a U.S. person who owns any Common Shares (directly or indirectly through foreign entities) on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes that persons pro rata share of that companys RPII for the entire taxable year, determined as if that RPII were distributed proportionately only to U.S. persons at that date regardless of whether that income is distributed. In addition, any RPII that is includible in the income of a U.S. tax-exempt organization may be treated as unrelated business taxable income. Neither American Safety Re nor American Safety Assurance expects gross RPII to equal or exceed 20% of its gross income for 2005 or subsequent years, and neither expects its direct or indirect insureds (including related persons) to directly or indirectly hold 20% or more of its voting power or value, but we cannot be certain that this will be the case because some of the factors which determine the extent of RPII may be beyond our control. If these thresholds are met or exceeded, and if you are an affected U.S. person, your investment could be materially adversely affected. The RPII provisions, however, have never been interpreted by the courts or the U.S. Treasury Department (the Treasury Department) in final regulations, and regulations interpreting the RPII provisions of the Code exist only in proposed form. It is not certain whether these regulations will be adopted in their proposed form or what changes or clarifications might ultimately be made thereto or whether any of those changes, as well as any interpretation or application of RPII by the IRS, the courts or otherwise, might have retroactive effect. The Treasury Department has authority to impose, among other things, additional reporting requirements with respect to RPII. Accordingly, the meaning of the RPII provisions and the application thereof to us is uncertain. See Certain Tax ConsiderationsCertain U.S. Federal Tax ConsiderationsTax Treatment of ShareholdersRelated Person Insurance Income. U.S. persons who dispose of Common Shares may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation at the rates applicable to dividends on aportion of their gain, if any. Section 1248 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) provides that if a U.S. person sells or exchanges stock of a foreign corporation and that person owned, directly, indirectly through certain foreign entities or constructively, 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of disposition when the corporation was a CFC, any gain from the sale or exchange of the shares will be treated as a dividend to the extent of that persons share of the CFCs earnings and profits (determined under U.S. federal income tax principles) during the period that person held the shares and while the corporation was a CFC (with certain adjustments). We believe that because of the dispersion of our Common Share ownership, provisions in our organizational documents that limit voting power and other factors, no U.S. shareholder, other than Fredrick C. Treadway or Treadway Associates, L.P., of American Safety Insurance should be treated as owning (directly, indirectly through foreign entities or constructively) 10% or more of the total voting power of American Safety Insurance. As a result, American Safety Insurance should not be a CFC and Section 1248 of the Code, as applicable under the general CFC rules, should not apply to dispositions of our shares. It is possible, however, that the IRS could challenge these provisions in our organizational documents and that a court could sustain that challenge. To the extent American Safety Insurance is a CFC, a 10% U.S. Shareholder may in certain circumstances be required to report a disposition of Common Shares by attaching IRS Form 5471 to the U.S. federal income tax or information return that it would normally file for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. For purposes of Section 1248 of the Code and the requirement to file Form 5471, special rules apply with respect to a U.S. persons disposition of shares of a foreign insurance company that has RPII during the five-year period ending on the date of the disposition. In general, if a U.S. person disposes of shares in a foreign insurance corporation in which U.S. persons own 25% or more of the shares (even if the amount of gross RPII is less than 20% of the corporations gross insurance income and the ownership of its shares by direct or indirect insureds and related persons is less than the 20% threshold), any gain from the disposition may be treated as a dividend to the extent of that persons share of the corporations undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that person owned the shares (whether or not those earnings and profits are attributable to RPII). As a result of these special rules and proposed Treasury Department regulations, the IRS may assert that Section 1248 of the Code and the requirement to file Form 5471 apply to dispositions of Common Shares because American Safety Insurance is engaged in the insurance business indirectly through subsidiaries. See Certain Tax ConsiderationsCertain U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsTax Treatment of ShareholdersDispositions of Shares in a CFC or RPII CFC. U.S. persons who hold Common Shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if American Safety Insurance is considered to be a Passive Foreign Investment Company (a PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If American Safety Insurance is considered a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. person who owns Common Shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences, including subjecting the investor to a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply and subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed, in which case your investment could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if American Safety Insurance were considered a PFIC, upon the death of any U.S. individual owning Common Shares, that individuals heirs or estate would not be entitled to a step-up in the basis of the shares which might otherwise be available under U.S. federal income tax laws. American Safety Insurance does not believe that it is, and does not expect to become, a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. No assurance can be given, however, that American Safety Insurance will not be deemed a PFIC by the IRS. If American Safety Insurance were considered a PFIC, it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation. There are currently no regulations regarding the application of the PFIC provisions to an insurance company. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming. We cannot predict what impact, if any, that guidance would have on an investor that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation. See Certain Tax ConsiderationsCertain U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsTax Treatment of ShareholdersPassive Foreign Investment Company. Risk Factors Relating to the Property and Casualty Insurance Industry Policy pricing in our industry is cyclical, and our financial results are impacted by that cyclicality. The property and casualty insurance industry has historically been a cyclical industry consisting of both hard market periods and soft market periods. During soft market periods, insurers tend to be more aggressive in writing policies and competitive in the pricing of those policies. Hard market periods are characterized by shortages of underwriting capacity and high premium rates. Beginning in 2000, we believe our industry experienced a hardening market, reflected by increasing rates and more restrictive coverage terms. These trends appeared to have started slowing in 2004. We believe the industry is now experiencing a softening market, where pricing generally has become more competitive and policy terms and conditions have become less restrictive. Therefore, we may not be able to achieve our growth and profitability goals. Because this cyclicality is due in large part to the economy, the particular needs of insureds and the actions of our competitors, we cannot predict the timing or duration of changes in the insurance market cycle. Our industry is subject to significant regulatory scrutiny. Recently, the insurance industry has been subject to a significant level of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies, including state attorneys general and insurance departments, concerning certain practices within the insurance industry. These practices include the receipt of contingent commissions by insurance brokers and agents from insurance companies and the extent to which this compensation has been disclosed, bid rigging and related matters. As a result of these and related matters, there have been a number of recent revisions to existing, or proposals to modify or enact new, laws and regulations regarding the relationship between insurance companies and producers. Any changes or further requirements that are adopted by federal, state or local governments could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, these issues have increased the regulatory scrutiny of our industry. We operate in a heavily regulated industry, and existing and future regulations may constrain how we conduct our business and couldimpose liabilities and other obligations upon us. Insurance Regulation. Our primary insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, as well as our non-subsidiary risk retention group affiliate, are subject to regulation under applicable insurance statutes of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed and write insurance. This regulation may limit our ability to, or speed with which we can, effectively respond to market opportunities and may require us to incur significant annual regulatory compliance expenditures. Insurance regulation is intended to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect shareholders of our insurance companies. Insurance regulation relates to authorized business lines, capital and surplus requirements, types and amounts of investments, underwriting limitations, trade practices, policy forms, claims practices, mandated participation in shared markets, loss reserve adequacy, insurer solvency, transactions with related parties, changes in control, payment of dividends and a variety of other financial and nonfinancial components of an insurance companys business. For instance, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital, or RBC, restrictions. RBC is a method of measuring the amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business in light of its size and risk profile. The ratio of a companys actual policyholder surplus to its minimum capital requirements will determine whether any state regulatory action is required. State regulatory authorities use the RBC formula to identify insurance companies which may be undercapitalized and may require further regulatory attention. Each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries satisfies its minimum capital requirements and none of them has been identified by any regulatory authority as being undercapitalized or requiring further regulatory attention. A number of legislative initiatives currently are under consideration by Congress. Any changes in insurance laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our operating results. We are unable to predict what additional laws and regulations, if any, affecting our business may be promulgated in the future or how they might be interpreted. Dividend Regulation. Like other insurance holding companies, American Safety Insurance Holdings, Ltd. relies on dividends from its insurance subsidiaries to be able to pay dividends and fulfill its other financial obligations. The payment of dividends by these subsidiaries and other intercompany transactions are subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries. As a result, insurance holding companies may not be able to receive dividends from their subsidiaries at times and in amounts sufficient to pay dividends and fulfill their other financial obligations. Additionally, as a Bermuda holding company, American Safety Insurance Holdings, Ltd. is subject to Bermuda regulatory constraints that will affect its ability to pay dividends on the Common Shares and to make other payments. Under the Companies Act, of 1981 ("the Companies Act") insurance holding companies may declare or pay a dividend out of distributable reserves only if it has reasonable grounds to believe that it is, and would after the payment be, able to pay liabilities as they become due and if the realizable value of its assets would thereby not be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and issued share capital and share premium accounts. We currently do not pay dividends on the Common Shares, nor do we expect to do so in the future. Environmental Regulation. Environmental remediation activities and other environmental risks are heavily regulated by both federal and state governments. Environmental regulation is continually evolving, and changes in the regulatory patterns at federal and state levels may have a significant effect upon potential claims against our insureds and us. These changes also may affect the demand for the types of insurance offered by and through us and the availability or cost to us of reinsurance. We are unable to predict what additional laws and regulations, if any, affecting environmental remediation activities and other environmental risks may be promulgated in the future, how they might be applied, and what their impact might be.
