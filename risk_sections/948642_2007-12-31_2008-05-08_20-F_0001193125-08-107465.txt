Risk Factors Continued growth in the mobile telecommunications markets in which we operate will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. These factors include: · the activities of our competitors; · competitive pressures and regulations applicable to retail and wholesale prices; · the development and introduction of new and alternative technologies for mobile telecommunications; · products and services and their attractiveness to customers; · the success of new disruptive or substitutive technologies; and · the development of the mobile communications markets. In addition, as our core domestic Italian market has become increasingly saturated, the focus of competition has shifted to customer retention from customer acquisition, and increasing the value of existing customers. Such focus could result in increased expenses to retain customer loyalty or if we are unable to satisfactorily offer better value to our customers our market share and revenues could decline. If the mobile telecommunications markets in which we operate do not continue to expand, or we are unable to retain our existing customers or stimulate increases in customer usage, our financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. We may be adversely affected if we fail to successfully implement our Internet and broadband strategy in Italy and internationally. The introduction of Internet and broadband services is an important element of our growth strategy and means to increase the use of our networks in Italy and expand our operations outside of Italy, particularly in Europe. The broadband market has continued to grow in 2007 at the same rate as 2006 but competitive pressure has also grown. Our strategy is to replace the mature, traditional voice services with value added content and services to consumers and small and medium-sized companies. Our ability to successfully implement this strategy may be affected if: · Internet usage in Italy grows more slowly than anticipated, for reasons such as changes in Internet users preferences; · broadband penetration in Italy and other European countries does not grow as we expect; · competition increases, for reasons such as the entry of new competitors, consolidation in the industry or technological developments introducing new platforms for Internet access and/or Internet distribution or other operators can provide broadband connections superior to those that we can offer; and · we experience any network interruptions or related problems with network infrastructure. Outside of Italy our ability to implement this strategy will depend on whether we are able to acquire assets or networks or utilize networks of incumbent operators that will allow us to offer such services. Any of the above factors may adversely affect the successful implementation of our strategy, our business and results of operations. Actual or perceived health risks or other problems relating to mobile handsets or transmission masts could lead to litigation or decreased mobile communications usage. The effects of and any damage caused by exposure to an electromagnetic field were and are the subject of careful evaluations by the international scientific community, but until now there is no scientific evidence of harmful effects on health. We cannot rule out that exposure to electromagnetic fields or other emissions originating from wireless handsets will not be identified as a health risk in the future. Our mobile communications business may be harmed as a result of these alleged health risks. For example, the perception of these health risks could result in a lower number of customers, reduced usage per customer or potential consumer liability. In addition, although Italian law already requires strict limits in relation to transmission equipment, these concerns may cause regulators to impose greater restrictions on the construction of base station towers or other infrastructure, which may hinder the completion of network build-outs and the commercial availability of new services and may require additional investments. 12 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Exchange Rates 3.2 EXCHANGE RATES We publish our consolidated financial statements in euros. References to , euro and Euro are to the euro, the single unified currency that was introduced in Italy and 10 other member states of the EU on January 1, 1999. References to U.S. dollars, dollars, U.S.$ or $ are to U.S. dollars, the currency of the United States of America. For convenience only (except where noted otherwise), certain euro figures have been translated into dollars at the rate (the Euro/Dollar Exchange Rate) of 1.00= U.S.$ 1.4603, using the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers in foreign currencies as announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for customs purposes (the Noon Buying Rate) on December 31, 2007. These translations should not be construed as a representation that the euro amounts actually represent such dollar amounts or have been or could be converted into dollars at the rate indicated. For the purpose of this Annual Report, billion means a thousand million.

The Ordinary Shares, par value 0.55 (the Ordinary Shares) and Savings Shares, par value 0.55 (the Savings Shares) of Telecom Italia trade on Mercato Telematico Azionario (Telematico), managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (Borsa Italiana) in euro. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar will affect the U.S. dollar equivalent of the euro price of the Ordinary Shares and the Savings Shares and the price of the Ordinary Share American Depositary Shares (Ordinary Share ADSs) and the Savings Share American Depositary Shares (Savings Share ADSs), on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Cash dividends are paid in euro. Exchange rate fluctuations will affect the U.S. dollar amounts received by owners of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs upon conversion by the Depositary of cash dividends paid in euro on the underlying Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares. See Item 10. Additional Information10.5 Description of American Depositary Receipts. On completion of the Merger, Telecom Italia (formerly Olivetti) became a successor registrant to Old Telecom Italia under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act) and, therefore, became subject to and continues to file periodic reports under the 1934 Act required for a foreign private issuer. Telecom Italia (formerly Olivetti) obtained a listing of the Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares issued at completion of the Merger, on the NYSE where such Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares trade in the form of ADSs. 13 Table of Contents Item 3.

(2) For the purposes of IFRS, Parent, as used in this Annual Report, means Telecom Italia S.p.A.. (3) The average number of employees in the Group (excluding employees relating to the consolidated companies considered as Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale and including personnel with temp work contracts) was 79,628, 79,993, 79,869 and 79,602 in 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (4) In accordance with IAS 33 (Earnings per share), basic earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the Groups profit available to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding treasury shares. Since Telecom Italia has both Ordinary and Savings Shares outstanding, the calculations also take into account the requirement that holders of Savings Shares are entitled to an additional dividend equal to 2% of the par value of shares above dividends paid on the Ordinary Shares. For the purpose of these calculations, the weighted average number of: · Ordinary Shares was 13,254,934,303 for the year ended December 31, 2007, 13,254,860,233 for the year ended December 31, 2006, 12,283,195,845 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 10,208,327,613 for the year ended December 31, 2004; · Savings Shares was 6,026,120,661 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, 5,930,204,164 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 5,795,921,069 for the year ended December 31, 2004. For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares outstanding is adjusted assuming conversion of all dilutive potential shares. Potential shares are those securities that, if converted into shares, would increase the total number of shares outstanding and reduce the earnings attributable to each share. Potential shares include options, warrants and convertible securities. The Groups profit is also adjusted to reflect the impact of the conversion of potential shares net of the related tax effects. (5) Telecom Italias dividend coupons for the year ended December 31, 2007, were clipped on April 21, 2008 and were payable from April 23, 2008. (6) Share capital represents share capital issued net of the par value of treasury shares. (7) Net Financial Debt is a Non-GAAP Financial Measure as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K under the 1934 Act. For further details please see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects5.4 Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 20075.4.2 Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 17 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Dividends 3.4 DIVIDENDS The determination of our future dividend policy, and the amounts thereof, will depend upon a number of factors, including but not limited to our earnings, financial condition and cash requirements, prospects and such other factors as may be deemed relevant at the time. Dividends declared by Telecom Italia (formerly Olivetti). The following table sets forth the dividends per Ordinary Share and per Savings Share declared by Telecom Italia with respect to each of the last five fiscal years and the aggregate dividends paid in such years. Actual dividends paid are rounded to the nearest whole cent.

(2) Approved at the Annual Shareholders Meeting held on April 14, 2008. Pursuant to Italian Stock Exchange rules, dividends on the Ordinary Shares and the Savings Shares are payable from the fourth trading day after the third Friday of each month, and in any case, at least four business days after the Shareholders Annual Meeting approving the dividends. Telecom Italias dividend coupons for the year ended December 31, 2007 were clipped on April 21, 2008, and were payable from April 24, 2008. Payment of annual dividends is subject to approval by the holders of Ordinary Shares at the annual general shareholders meeting, which must be convened within 120 days after the end of the financial year to which it relates. In addition, Article 21 of the Companys Bylaws gives the Board of Directors the power to approve the distribution of interim dividends. Pursuant to Italian law, the distribution may be approved after the final approval of the preceding years financial statements, and the interim dividends may not exceed the lower of (i) the difference between profits from the preceding fiscal year and amounts required to be attributed to legal and statutory reserves and (ii) available reserves. Once paid in compliance with applicable laws, shareholders cannot be required to repay interim dividends to the Company if the shareholders collected such dividends in good faith. Dividends not collected within five years from the date they become payable will be forfeited in favor of the Company. If profits are not fully distributed, additional reserves are created. According to the Italian Civil Code, before dividends may be paid with respect to any year, an amount equal to 5% of the profit of the Company for such year must be set aside to the legal reserve until the legal reserve, including amounts set aside during prior years, is at least equal to one-fifth of the par value of the Companys issued share capital. This legal reserve is not available for payment of dividends. Such restriction on the payment of dividends applies, on a non-consolidated basis, to each Italian subsidiary of the Telecom Italia Group. The Company may also pay dividends out of available retained earnings from prior years or other reserves. Dividends in respect of Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares held with Monte Titoli S.p.A. (Monte Titoli) are automatically credited to the accounts of the beneficial owners with the relevant participant of Monte Titoli, without the need for presentation by such beneficial owners of any documentation. See Item 10. Additional Information10.4 Description of Capital Stock. Arrangements between Euroclear or Clearstream and Monte Titoli permit the shareholders to collect the dividends through Euroclear or Clearstream. Holders of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are entitled to receive payments in respect of dividends on the underlying Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares, as the case may be, in accordance with the relevant Deposit Agreement. Dividends payable on the Companys Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares may be subject to deduction of Italian withholding tax. See Item 10. Additional Information10.6 Taxation. Italian regulations do not contain any specific restrictions on the payment of dividends to non-residents of Italy. See Item 10. Additional Information10.2 Exchange Controls and Other Limitations Affecting Security Holders. 18 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Dividends Pursuant to Italian law, in connection with the payment of dividends, participants of Monte Titoli are required to supply to the Italian tax authorities certain information concerning the identity of non-resident shareholders holding Ordinary Shares or Savings Shares. Shareholders are required to provide their Italian tax identification number, if any, or alternatively, in the case of legal entities, their name, country of establishment and address, or in the case of individuals, their name, address and place and date of birth, or in the case of partnerships, the information required for legal entities and the information required for individuals with respect to one of their representatives. In the case of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs owned by non-residents of Italy, Telecom Italia understands that the provision of information concerning the Depositary, in its capacity as holder of record of the Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares, as the case may be, will satisfy these requirements. The Depositary, in accordance with Telecom Italia, will provide information to beneficial owners of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs, that are considered U.S. residents for purposes of applicable law, to the extent such owners wish to benefit from reduced withholding tax rates on dividends under an income tax convention, and claims for such benefits therefore must be accompanied by the required information. See Item 10. Additional Information10.6 Taxation. 19 Table of Contents
