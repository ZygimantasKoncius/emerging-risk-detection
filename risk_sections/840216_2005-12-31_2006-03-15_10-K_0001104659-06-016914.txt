Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the risks previously mentioned, the following important risk factors could adversely impact our business. These risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking and other statements that we make in periodic reports and other filings with the SEC, and that we make from time to time in our news releases, annual reports and other written communications, as well as other statements made from time to time by our representatives. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects could be materially adversely affected: Factors may affect our future results (Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). Certain information included in this report or in other materials we have filed or will file with the SEC (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us) contains or may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They contain words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, plan, believe, may, can, could, might and other words or phrases of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: · statements about our strategies, plans, objectives, goals, expectations and intentions; · information relating to anticipated operating results, financial resources, changes in revenues, changes in profitability, interest expense, growth and expansion, anticipated income to be realized from our investments in unconsolidated entities; · the impact of demographic trends and supply constraints on the demand for and supply of housing; · housing market conditions in the geographic markets in which we operate; · the number and types of homes and number of acres of land that we may develop and sell; · the ability to deliver homes from backlog; · the timing and outcomes of regulatory approval processes or administrative proceedings, which may result in delays in the land entitlement, development, construction, or the opening of new communities (including, but not limited to ongoing administrative proceedings related to our joint venture near Oxnard, California); · the ability to secure materials and subcontractors; · the ability to produce the liquidity and capital necessary to expand and take advantage of opportunities in the future; · our ability to realize the value of our net operating loss carry forwards; · our ability to continue relationships with current or future partners; · the effectiveness and adequacy of our disclosure and internal controls; · the impact of recent accounting pronouncements; and · stock market valuations. Any or all of the forward-looking statements included in this report and in any other reports or public statements made by us may turn out to be inaccurate. This can occur as a result of incorrect assumptions or 13 as a consequence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in this report or in other reports or public statements made by us, such as government regulation and the competitive environment, will be important in determining our future performance. Consequently, actual results may differ materially from those that might be anticipated from our forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements because they are based on current expectations or beliefs regarding future events or circumstances, which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that our strategies, plans, objectives, goals, expectations and intentions reflected in, or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable given current information available to us, we can give no assurance that any of them will be achieved. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in our subsequent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K should be consulted. The following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business includes factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Other factors beyond those listed below, including factors unknown to us and factors known to us which we have not determined to be material, could also adversely affect us. This discussion is provided as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and all of our forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referenced in this section. Our homebuilding operations lack geographic diversification. Our residential land development and homebuilding operations are limited to the following six Southern California counties: Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and Ventura. Therefore, economic and other events that adversely impact this comparatively narrow geographic region will have a direct negative impact on our business and operations. Because we do not have more diversified geographic operations, the following risk factors should be considered with extreme care given the potential material adverse effect on our limited operations that could occur if any of these risks become a reality. Our business is cyclical and downward changes in economic conditions generally or in the market regions where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas. The residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as those which are listed below. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the market regions where we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes, either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings. Our business is substantially affected by changes in national and general economic factors outside of our control, such as: · short and long term interest rates; · the availability of financing for homebuyers; · consumer confidence (which can be substantially affected by external conditions, including international hostilities involving the United States); 14 · consumer income; · federal mortgage financing programs; and · federal income tax provisions. The cyclicality of our business is also highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions that can occur on a local or regional basis, such as changes in: · housing demand; · population growth; · employment levels and job growth; and · property taxes. The factors described above can cause demand and prices for our homes to diminish or cause us to take longer and incur more costs to build our homes. We may not be able to recover these increased costs by raising prices because the price of each home is usually set several months before the home is delivered, as our customers typically sign their home purchase contracts before construction has even begun on their homes. In addition, some of the factors described above could cause some homebuyers to cancel their home purchase contracts altogether. Supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries. Fluctuating lumber prices and shortages, as well as shortages or price fluctuations in other important building materials, can have an adverse effect on our homebuilding business. Similarly, labor shortages or unrest among key trades, such as carpenters, roofers, electricians and plumbers, can delay the delivery of our homes and increase our costs. Rebuilding efforts underway in the gulf coast region of the United States following the destruction caused by the two devastating hurricanes there in the summer of 2005 may cause or exacerbate shortages of labor and/or certain materials. Inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup if demand declines. Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor may require us to increase the sales price of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins. However, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand, in which case we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease. Tax law changes could make home ownership more expensive or less attractive. Significant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, generally are deductible expenses for an individuals federal, and in some cases state, income taxes, subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy. If the federal government or a state government changes income tax laws, as has been discussed recently, to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions, then the after-tax cost of owning a new home would increase substantially. This could adversely impact demand for, and/or sales prices of, new homes. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters could delay deliveries, increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas. Weather conditions and natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, floods, droughts, fires, extended periods of rain and other environmental conditions can harm our homebuilding business on a local or regional basis. Civil unrest can also have an adverse effect on our homebuilding business. 15 The homebuilding industry has not experienced an economic downturn in many years, which may have resulted in land and new homes being overvalued. Although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical, it has not experienced a downturn in many years. During 2005, land and home prices rose significantly in several of our markets. Some have speculated that the prices of land and new homes, and the stock prices of companies like ours that build new homes, are inflated and may decline if the demand for new homes weakens. A decline in the prices for new homes would have an adverse effect on our homebuilding business, in particular on our revenues and margins. A decline in our stock price could also make financing or raising capital more difficult and expensive. When mortgage-financing costs are high, or as credit quality declines, customers may be unwilling or unable to purchase our homes. The majority of our homebuyers finance their purchases through our joint venture with Wells Fargo or third-party lenders. In general, housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and by decreases in the availability of mortgage financing as a result of declining customer credit quality or other issues. If mortgage interest rates increase and the ability or willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases is adversely affected, our operating results may be adversely affected. Some homebuyers may cancel their home purchases because the required deposits are small and generally refundable, if new home prices decline, interest rates increase or there is a downturn in the economy. Our backlog numbers reflect the number of homes for which we have entered into a sales contract with a customer but not yet delivered. Those sales contracts typically require only a small deposit and the deposit is generally refundable if customers are unable to close on the sale of their existing home, fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. If the prices for new homes begin to decline, interest rates increase or there is a downturn in local or regional economies or the national economy, homebuyers may have financial incentive to terminate their existing sales contracts in order to negotiate for a lower price or to explore other options. Such a result could have an adverse effect on our homebuilding business and our results of operations. Competition for homebuyers, labor and materials could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability. The homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor, materials and suitable land, as well as homebuyers. We compete in each of our markets with numerous national, regional and local homebuilders many of whom have substantially greater resources than we do. In addition, smaller regional and local builders can have an advantage in local markets because of long-standing relationships they may have with local labor or land sellers. This competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver, or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume. We also compete with resales of existing used or foreclosed homes, housing speculators and available rental housing. Increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes and increase cancellations of sales contracts in backlog. Slow or no growth initiatives have been or may be adopted in regions where we operate, which could adversely affect our ability to build or timely build in these areas. Some municipalities where we operate have approved, and others where we operate may approve, various slow growth or no growth homebuilding initiatives and other ballot measures that could negatively impact the availability of land and building opportunities within those localities. Approval of slow growth, no growth or similar initiatives (including the effect of these initiatives on existing entitlements and zoning) could adversely affect our ability to build or timely build and sell homes in the affected markets and or 16 create additional administrative and regulatory requirements and costs, which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our future revenues and earnings. We may not be able to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices, which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues, earnings and margins. The availability of finished and partially developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control, including land availability in general, competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property, inflation in land prices, and zoning, allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements. Our long-term ability to build homes depends upon our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build. As competition for suitable land increases, and as available land is developed, the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise, and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline. Over the past few years, we have experienced an increase in competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets. Any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs. We may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs, which could adversely impact our revenues, earnings and margins. We are subject to substantial legal and regulatory requirements regarding the development of land, the homebuilding process and protection of the environment, and compliance with federal, state and local regulations related to our business could have substantial costs both in time and money, and some regulations could prohibit or restrict some homebuilding projects. Our homebuilding business is heavily regulated and subject to increasing local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, resource protection, other environmental impacts, building design, construction and similar matters. These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that regulate these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of a specified project or a number of projects in particular markets. We may also experience periodic delays in homebuilding projects due to building moratoria in any of the areas in which we operate. Our business is conducted in California, which is one of the most highly regulated and litigious states in the country. Therefore, our potential exposure to losses and expenses due to new laws, regulations or litigation may be greater than other homebuilders with a less significant California presence. We are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect the land development and homebuilding process, including laws and regulations related to zoning, permitted land uses, levels of density, building design, elevation of properties, water and waste disposal and use of open spaces. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations related to workers health and safety. We generally are required to obtain permits, entitlements and approvals from local authorities to commence and complete residential development or home construction. Such permits, entitlements and approvals may, from time-to-time, be opposed or challenged by local governments, neighboring property owners or other interested parties, adding delays, costs and risks of non-approval to the process. Our obligation to comply with the laws and regulations under which we operate, and our obligation to ensure that our employees, subcontractors and other agents comply with these laws and regulations, could result in delays in construction and land development, cause us to incur substantial costs and prohibit or restrict land development and homebuilding activity in certain areas in which we operate. We are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. These laws and regulations may cause delays in construction and delivery of new homes, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. In addition, 17 environmental laws may impose liability for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances whether or not the developer or owner of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of those substances. The presence of those substances on our properties may prevent us from selling our homes and we may also be liable, under applicable laws and regulations or lawsuits brought by private parties, for hazardous or toxic substances on properties and lots that we have sold in the past. Changing market conditions may adversely impact our ability to sell homes at expected prices, which could reduce our margins. There is often a significant amount of time between when we initially acquire land and when we can make homes on that land available for sale. The market value of a proposed home can vary significantly during this time due to changing market conditions. In the past, we have benefited from increases in the value of homes over time, but if market conditions were to reverse, we may need to sell homes at lower prices than we anticipate. We may also need to take write-downs of our home inventories and land holdings if market values decline. Home prices and sales activity in the particular markets and regions in which we do business impact our results of operations because our business is concentrated in these markets. Home prices and sales activity in some of our key markets have declined from time to time for market-specific reasons, including adverse weather or economic contraction due to, among other things, the failure or decline of key industries and employers. If home prices or sales activity decline in one or more of the key markets in which we operate, our costs may not decline at all or at the same rate and, as a result, our overall results of operations may be adversely impacted. Product liability litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect our business. As a homebuilder, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high, and the amount of coverage offered by insurance companies is currently limited. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly. If we are not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims, we may experience losses that could hurt our financial results. We could be hurt by the loss of key management personnel. Our future success depends, to a significant degree, on the efforts of our senior management. Our operations could be adversely affected if key members of senior management cease to be active in our company. Future terrorist attacks against the United States or increased domestic or international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations. Adverse developments in the war on terrorism, future terrorist attacks against the United States, or increased domestic or international instability could adversely affect our business. 18 Item 1B.
