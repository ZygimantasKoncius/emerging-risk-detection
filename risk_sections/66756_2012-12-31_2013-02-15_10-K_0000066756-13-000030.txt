Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)We may not be able to successfully implement our strategic objectives of growing load at the utility, due to the inability of current and potential industrial customers to obtain necessary governmental permits in order to successfully implement expansion plans.As part of our long-term strategy, we pursue new wholesale and retail loads in and around our service territory. Currently, there are several companies in northeastern Minnesota that are in the process of developing natural resource-based projects that represent long-term growth potential and load diversity for Minnesota Power. These projects may include construction of new facilities and restarts of old facilities, both of which require permitting and/or approvals to be obtained before the projects can be successfully implemented. If a project cannot be implemented due to certain governmental (including environmental) permits and approvals not being obtained, our long-term strategy and thus our results of operations could be adversely impacted.Weak real estate market conditions in Florida may continue to adversely affect our strategy to sell our Florida real estate.ALLETE intends to sell its Florida land assets when opportunities arise. However, if weak market conditions continue, the impact on our future operations would be the continuation of little to no sales while still incurring operating expenses such as community development district assessments and property taxes which could result in continued annual net operating losses at ALLETE Properties. The properties could also be at risk for impairment which could adversely impact our results of operations. (See Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies â€“ Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.)Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.
