Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 20-F. We caution you that our businesses and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. A. Operating Results We are one of the largest handset design and software solution providers based in China. Since our inception in 2002, we have been providing complete handset design services spanning the entire handset design cycle, which involves industrial design, hardware design, component selection and sourcing, prototype testing, pilot production and production support. While we design GSM-based mobile handsets based on major baseband technology platforms, we launched our first 3G handset based on the WCDMA/GSM technology platform in the third quarter of 2005 and have re-allocated most of our GSM resources to focus on 3G handset design and development. We have also begun to develop smart phones. In June 2006, we and QUALCOMM formed TechSoft in China to develop software applications for wireless communication devices. We indirectly own 70% of TechSoft. In the first quarter of 2006, we realigned our business operations into three business units, namely, handset design business unit, smart phone and pocket PC unit, and wireless software and application business unit. The realignment does not affect our financial reporting for prior fiscal years. The mobile handset industry is characterized by shortened product life cycles, increasing competition, margin pressure for wireless handset brand owners and a growing trend toward outsourcing. We expect our business to be primarily driven by the growing mobile handset markets and the industry trend to outsource the handset design function. We also expect our future revenue growth to be driven by our design contracts from new international customers and top Chinese customers and the expansion of our service offerings to cover handsets for sale internationally. Our gross margins have varied since our inception and are expected to continue to vary as a result of a variety of factors. These factors include changes in the relative mix of our services and products and the terms at which we offer them. In order to maintain or improve our gross margin for our design services, we must reduce our unit cost through achieving greater economies of scale, particularly in the face of price pressures in a competitive market. We offer PCBs, wireless modules and other component products principally at cost, plus a margin. We also assist customers in procuring handset testing equipment. We offer these products and services principally for strategic purposes at a margin lower than that for our design services. For example, we sell PCBs as a means of determining our customers handset sales for calculating royalty payments under arrangements discussed in  Net Revenues below. Accordingly, to the extent the contribution of component sales to our net revenues increases, our blended gross margin will correspondingly decrease, in the absence of any other change. 34 Table of Contents In response to customer demand, we intend to sell completed smart phone handsets that we design beginning in 2006. We do not, however, intend to manufacture the smart phones ourselves, but will outsource the manufacturing to EMS providers. We expect the margins from the sale of completed smart phones to generate a lower gross margin than from design services only. In addition, as we believe demand for 3G handsets presents significant opportunity to us, we have re-allocated most of our GSM resources to focus on 3G programs beginning from the fourth quarter of 2005. As we halted two out of four GSM platforms, this will impact our revenue in the short term. We provide mobile handset design services to mobile handset brand owners. Our customers include leading Chinese mobile handset brand owners, and international mobile handset brand owners. Although Chinese mobile handset customers fueled our initial growth, international brand owners have contributed to an increasing portion of our net revenues. We expect the revenue contribution from international mobile handset customers to increase rapidly as we focus our sales and marketing efforts to target international brand owners while retaining the top Chinese brand owners. A small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our net revenues. In 2003, our top three customers collectively accounted for approximately 88.2% of our net revenues. In 2004, our top three customers collectively accounted for approximately 51.0% of our net revenues. In 2005, our top three customers collectively accounted for approximately 55.1% of our net revenues, and NEC contributed over 10% of our net revenues for the period. Sales to our largest customers have varied from period to period due primarily to our relatively short period of operation and the continued expansion of our customer base. As international mobile handset brand owners offer high growth potential to our business, and Chinese mobile handset brand owners are reportedly experiencing declining profitability due to intense competition from international brand owners and decrease in consumer demand, we believe that our future growth and success will depend in part on the extent to which leading international mobile handset brand owners engage us to design mobile handsets for them. We expect that our largest customers will vary significantly in the future as we aim to attract more international mobile handset brand owners as our customers. Major Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations Net Revenues. We derive our revenues primarily from mobile handset design services, and to a lesser extent, sales of wireless modules, PCBs, and other component products for mobile handsets. Revenues from design services comprise of design fees and royalty income. We recognize design fees as revenues only when a pre-agreed milestone has been reached. In general, three milestones are identified in our design contracts with customers. When the mobile handset design receives the approval verifying its conformity with applicable industry standards, in the case of GSM-based handsets, the full type approval, or FTA, for its conformity with GSM standards, we achieve the first milestone with respect to the design. When the mobile handset design receives regulatory approval for its use in the intended country, in the case of China, a China type approval, or CTA, we achieve the second milestone. When the customer accepts the mobile handset design and is ready to begin mass production of mobile handsets based on our design, we achieve the last milestone, which we refer to as shipping acceptance, or SA. We generally charge a fixed price for our projects and recognize revenues based on percentage of completion of the project upon attaining pre-agreed milestones set forth in the agreement with the customer. We measure progress toward 35 Table of Contents completion by reference to the total labor costs and direct project expenses incurred as of the time we reach a pre-agreed milestone, as compared to the total labor costs and direct project expenses we expect to incur for completing a design project through SA, the last milestone. We believe this measure of percentage of completion best reflects the value of the work completed as of the milestone. If actual labor costs and direct project expenses change after a milestone is reached, we adjust the cost of revenues for the period during which we know the facts that give rise to the change. If a milestone has not been reached, the associated cost is deferred and revenues are not recognized until the milestone has been achieved. We have entered into royalty arrangements with Chinese mobile handset brand owners and a limited number of international mobile handset brand owners, pursuant to which we charge a royalty in addition to the design fees described above. The royalty is calculated at a variable rate based on the volume of mobile handsets manufactured by a customer. In addition, beginning from the fourth quarter of 2004, some of our component suppliers and technology providers agreed to provide commissions to us for the use of their components and technology in our designs, and we recognize such commissions as part of our royalty income when these component suppliers and technology providers confirm the amount of commissions. We recognize revenues from sales of wireless modules, PCBs and other electronic component products for mobile handsets upon delivery of these products to the customer. The customer orders component products it requires to manufacture mobile handsets from us. We then source the production of the component products from an outside supplier. We recognize revenues when the component products are delivered to the customer. We record the gross amounts billed to our customers as we are the primary obligor in these transactions. This is because we have latitude in establishing prices, are involved in the determination of the service specifications, bear credit risk and inventory risk and have the right to select the suppliers. We also assist certain customers in installing mobile handset testing lines and recognize revenues when these lines are installed. Our net revenues from design fees and royalty income reflect deductions from our gross revenues for local business taxes incurred by our subsidiaries in China. Each of our subsidiaries in China is subject to a local business tax at an effective rate of 5% on revenues generated from services provided in China. We may, upon application to and approval from relevant tax authorities, be eligible for full refunds of the business taxes to the extent they related to the revenue generated under technology development agreements and/or technical marketing agreements. We have applied for and received refunds in connection with the revenues generated under several of our mobile handset design contracts. Our net revenues from sales of wireless modules, PCBs and other component products reflect deductions from our gross revenues for value-added taxes incurred by our subsidiaries in China. We are required to pay value added tax, or VAT, at a rate of 17% of the gross sales proceeds received by our PRC subsidiaries from such sales. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our design fees primarily consists of part of our engineers compensation and benefits for the period during which they are involved in any mobile handset design project, and to a lesser extent, product warranty expenses, costs of materials used in making handset prototypes and depreciation and amortization of intangible assets including technology licenses and royalty rights used in connection with our design services. Cost of revenues for our royalty income normally are minimal. Cost of revenues from our sales of wireless modules consists primarily of cost of materials used in making 36 Table of Contents wireless modules, and to a lesser extent, compensation and benefits to our staff associated with the wireless module business. Cost of revenues from sales of PCBs and other component products consists of the cost of acquiring PCBs and other component products from third parties, and cost incurred in connection with our assisting customers in installing testing equipment and lines for the testing of handsets before shipment. Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses consist of general and administrative, research and development and selling and marketing expenses and expenses related to impairment of acquired intangible assets. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits of administrative personnel, lease expenses for occupancy associated with administration, travel and other expenses for general and administrative purposes, as well as costs for professional services, including legal and accounting services. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of the portion of our engineers compensation and benefits not attributable to any mobile handset design project pursuant to a design contract, amortization of assets related to research and development, compensation and benefits to our engineers who are involved in the development of wireless modules, and lease expenses for occupancy associated with research and development. Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of expenses related to marketing and promotion activities, compensation and benefits for sales and marketing personnel and travel expenses of sales and marketing personnel. We expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute terms as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel and expand our selling and marketing network in Japan, Europe and North America to promote and sell our services. Income Taxes. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, where we are located, and the current laws of the British Virgin Islands, where our holding company and intermediate holding companies are located, we are not subject to tax on our income or capital gains. In addition, our payment of dividends is not subject to withholding tax in these jurisdictions. Under the current laws of China, our subsidiaries in China are subject to state enterprise income tax, or EIT, at a rate of 33% on taxable income in China. TechFaith China, TechFaith Beijing, STEP Technologies and Techfaith Intelligent Handset Beijing have all been classified by the PRC government authorities as new and high technology enterprises. In addition, all of them are located in the special technology development zone in Beijing. As a result of these factors, they are entitled to a preferential EIT rate of 15% and a three-year exemption from EIT beginning from their respective first years of operation, followed by a 50% reduction in the EIT rate for the succeeding three years. TechFaith Shanghai is exempt from EIT from 2005 to 2006. Applicable laws and regulations in China specify certain financial and non-financial criteria for a company to be eligible for and maintain its status as a new and high technology enterprise. The status of our subsidiaries in China is re-assessed on a bi-annual basis. 37 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our financial statements in conformity with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the financial reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements as their application assists management in making their business decisions. Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are primarily derived from designing mobile handsets and we generate our revenues principally through design fees and royalty income. We recognize design fees in accordance with Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2 because the software element of the handset has been deemed more than incidental for the handset design process taken as a whole. Accordingly, as prescribed by SOP 97-2, we recognize design fees revenues in accordance with SOP 81-1 Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts as the handset design process requires significant production, development or customization of software. SOP 81-1 provides that the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition is preferable in instances where reasonably dependable estimates exist. We believe that we are able to produce such estimates and to appropriately measure the amount of revenues to be recognized at the date each contractual milestone  FTA, CTA or SA  is achieved using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Consistent with SOP 81-1, we believe that an output measure, such as contract milestones, is most reflective of the manner in which we earn revenues under our design contracts. Accordingly, we recognize design fee revenues as each contractual milestone is met, based on the percentage of completion at each milestone by using input measures  labor hours and other relevant costs incurred through the date of milestone compared to the total labor hours and other relevant costs estimated to be incurred to complete the design project through the last milestone. We believe that these contractual milestones are significant and specific tasks that are outlined in the design contracts and provide our customers with the ability to review the project status. We also believe that this is more reflective of the design progress completed through the date of the milestone, as opposed to designating percentage of completion based on the amounts that become billable at the milestone. The customized mobile handset design process involves industrial design, mechanical design, software design, hardware design, component selection and sourcing, prototype testing and pilot production. It typically takes six to nine months to complete a mobile handset design project. We generally enter into a design contract with each customer with respect to a design project prior to the commencement of the project. On a periodic basis, management estimates the percentage of completion of each project to calculate the amount of revenues to be recognized when each project reaches a contractual milestone. Recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision 38 Table of Contents become known. Accordingly, any changes in our estimates would impact our future operating results. Our project and department managers have significant experience in the design and development of mobile handsets. The estimates deployed are based on their experience designing handsets. These are estimates and therefore contain a risk of change. In our experience, we have not experienced material adverse changes from period to period in calculating the percentage of completion. Results of Operations The following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated. Our business has evolved rapidly and significantly since we commenced operations in July 2002. Our limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results very difficult. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as being indicative of future performance. For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 (In thousands) Consolidated Statement of Operations Data Net revenues: Design fees $ 7,947 $ 29,495 $ 63,020 Royalty income 1,259 6,961 15,651 Component products 471 10,104 11,439 Total net revenues $ 9,677 $ 46,560 $ 90,110 Cost of revenues: Design fees $ 2,260 $ 10,951 $ 26,258 Royalty income  725  Component products 371 8,208 8,803 Total cost of revenues $ 2,631 $ 19,884 $ 35,061 Gross profit: Design fees $ 5,687 $ 18,544 $ 36,762 Royalty income 1,259 6,236 15,651 Component products 100 1,896 2,636 Total gross profit $ 7,046 $ 26,676 $ 55,049 Operating expenses: General and administrative $ (968 ) $ (4,771 ) $ (9,574 ) Research and development (700 ) (2,506 ) (3,447 ) Selling and marketing (39 ) (694 ) (1,269 ) Impairment of acquired intangible assets (423 )   Total operating expenses $ (2,130 ) $ (7,971 ) $ (14,290 ) Income from operations $ 4,916 $ 18,705 $ 40,759 Total other income (loss), net (9 ) (484 ) 2,149 Income taxes   (54 ) Minority interests 49 23 (1,469 ) Net income $ 4,956 $ 18,244 $ 41,385 39 Table of Contents Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2004 and the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Revenues Our net revenues increased substantially by 93.5% to US$90.1 million in 2005 from US$46.6 million in 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in net revenues from design fees and, to a much lesser extent, increases in net revenues from component products and royalty income. Design Fees. Our net revenues from design fees increased substantially to US$63.0 million in 2005 from US$29.5 million in 2004 because of a significant growth of our wireless handset design service business. In 2005, a total of 123 designs contributed to our design fee revenues, 77 of our mobile handset designs achieved the FTA milestone, 72 of our mobile handset designs achieved the CTA milestone, and 80 of our mobile handset designs achieved the SA milestone. In contrast, in 2004, a total of 58 handset designs contributed to our design fee revenues, 69 mobile handsets designed by us reached the FTA milestone, 62 mobile handsets designed by us achieved the CTA milestone and 55 mobile handsets designed by us achieved the SA milestone. Royalty Income. Our royalty income increased substantially by 124.8% to US$15.7 million in 2005 from US$7.0 million in 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the continuous completion of handset design projects throughout 2005. Component Products. Revenues from sales of our component products increased by 13.2% to US$11.4 million in 2005 from US$10.1 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to our recent entrance into the CDMA wireless modules market. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues increased substantially by 76.3% to US$35.1 million in 2005 from US$19.9 million in 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in cost of revenues for design fees due to the increased number of projects completed during the period and, to a much lesser extent, a small increase in cost of revenues for component products. Design Fees. Cost of revenues for design fees increased substantially to US$26.3 million in 2005 from US$11.0 million in 2004, primarily as a result of increased compensation and benefits allocated to engineers who worked on design projects in 2005. Royalty Income. We did not incur any cost of revenues for royalty income in 2005. Component Products. Cost of revenues for component products increased slightly by 7.3% to US$8.8 million in 2005 from US$8.2 million in 2004. The increase was due primarily to an increases in sales of component products in 2005. Gross Profit Our gross profit was US$55.0 million in 2005, compared to US$26.7 million in 2004, representing gross margins of 61.1% and 57.3%, respectively. 40 Table of Contents Design Fees. Our gross profit for design fees was US$36.8 million in 2005, compared to US$18.5 million in 2004, representing gross margins of 58.3% and 62.9%, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of a decrease in the average design fee per project in 2005 as compared to 2004. Royalty Income. Our gross profit for royalty income was US$15.7 million in 2005, compared to US$6.2 million in 2004, representing gross margins of 100% and 89.6%, respectively. The increase in gross margin was because we did not incur any cost of revenues for royalty income in 2005. Component Products. Our gross profit from the sale of component products was US$2.6 million in 2005, compared to US$1.9 million in 2004, representing gross margins of 23.0% and 18.8%, respectively. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of higher margin contribution from selling CDMA-based wireless modules. Operating Expenses Operating expenses increased by 79.3% to US$14.3 million in 2005 from US$8.0 million in 2004. The increase was due to increases in general and administrative expenses and selling and marketing expenses and, to a lesser extent, an increase in research and development. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased to US$9.6 million in 2005 from US$4.8 million in 2004. The increase was due primarily to a substantial increase in our administrative personnel as we continued to grow our business, increase in professional service fees as a newly listed company, and to a lesser extent, an increase in rental costs as we leased new office space for administrative use. The increase was also attributable to recording allowance for doubtful account. Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased by 37.6% to US$3.4 million in 2005 from US$2.5 million in 2004. The increase was due primarily to our continuous investment in emerging technologies. Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 82.9% to US$1.3 million in 2005 from US$0.7 million in 2004. The increase was due primarily to the increase in our selling and marketing staff and activities as we expanded our efforts to market and sell our services. Total Other Income (Loss), Net We recorded a total other net income of US$2.1 million in 2005 as compared to total other net loss of US$0.5 million in 2004, primarily due to an increase in interest income and partially offset by a negative change in fair value of call option. Net Income Our net income increased to US$41.4 million in 2005 from US$18.2 million in 2004 as a result of the cumulative effect of the foregoing factors. 41 Table of Contents Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2003 and the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Revenues Our net revenues increased substantially to US$46.6 million in 2004 from US$9.7 million in 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in net revenues from design fees and, to a lesser extent, substantial increases in net revenues from component products and royalty income. Design Fees. Our net revenues from design fees increased substantially to US$29.5 million in 2004 from US$7.9 million in 2003 because of a significant growth of our wireless handset design service business. In 2003, a total of 9 handset designs contributed to our design fee revenues, 11 mobile handsets designed by us reached the FTA milestone, 4 mobile handsets designed by us achieved the CTA milestone and 3 mobile handsets designed by us achieved the SA milestone. In contrast, in 2004, a total of 58 designs contributed to our design fee revenues, 69 of our mobile handset designs achieved the FTA milestone, 62 of our mobile handset designs achieved the CTA milestone, and 55 of our mobile handset designs achieved the SA milestone. Our customer base expanded substantially in 2004. International customers such as Kyocera, Mitsubishi, NEC and UTStarcom engaged us to design mobile handsets, while eight of the top ten Chinese mobile handset brand owners were our customers in 2004. Royalty Income. Our royalty income increased substantially to US$7.0 million in 2004 from US$1.3 million in 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to the continuous completion of handset design projects throughout 2004, whereas we only began generating royalty income in the fourth quarter of 2003, after completing our first design project in September 2003. Component Products. Revenues from sales of our component products increased substantially to US$10.1 million in 2004 from US$0.5 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to substantial increases in sales of PCBs to US$6.0 million in 2004 from US$0.4 million in 2003 and sales of other components for mobile handsets to US$4.1 million in 2004 from US$0.1 million in 2003. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues increased substantially to US$19.9 million in 2004 from US$2.6 million in 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in cost of revenues for design fees and, to a lesser extent, substantial increases in cost of revenues for component products and royalty income. Design Fees. Cost of revenues for design fees increased substantially to US$11.0 million in 2004 from US$2.3 million in 2003, primarily as a result of increased compensation and benefits allocated to engineers who worked on design projects in 2004. Royalty Income. Our cost of revenues for royalty income was US$0.7 million in 2004. This cost related to amortization charges associated with our acquisition of certain intangible assets from Beijing Qidi in January 2004. We did not incur any cost of revenues for royalty income in 2003. 42 Table of Contents Component Products. Cost of revenues for component products increased substantially to US$8.2 million in 2004 from US$0.4 million in 2003. The increase was due primarily to increases in cost of revenues of PCBs to US$5.0 million in 2004 from US$0.3 million in 2003 and cost of revenues of other components for mobile handsets to US$3.2 million in 2004 from US$0.1 million in 2003. Gross Profit Our gross profit was US$26.7 million in 2004, compared to US$7.0 million in 2003, representing gross margins of 57.3% and 72.8%, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was primarily as a result of an increase in cost of revenues across all three categories of our revenues. Design Fees. Our gross profit for design fees was US$18.5 million in 2004, compared to US$5.7 million in 2003, representing gross margins of 62.9% and 71.6%, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of a decrease in the average design fee per project in 2004 as compared to 2003. Royalty Income. Our gross profit for royalty income was US$6.2 million in 2004, compared to US$1.3 million in 2003, representing gross margins of 89.6% and 100%, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was because we incurred cost of revenues for royalty income in 2004. Component Products. Our gross profit from the sale of component products was US$1.9 million in 2004, compared to US$0.1 million in 2003, representing gross margins of 18.8% and 21.2%, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of the increases in cost of revenues from PCBs. Operating Expenses Operating expenses increased to US$8.0 million in 2004 from US$2.1 million in 2003. The increase was due to substantial increases in general and administrative expenses and research and development and, to a lesser extent, an increase in selling and marketing expenses. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased to US$4.8 million in 2004 from US$1.0 million in 2003. The increase was due primarily to a substantial increase in our administrative personnel as we continued to grow our business, and to a lesser extent, an increase in rental costs as we leased new premises to accommodate our growth. The increase was also attributable to additional staff and rent expenses related to TechFaith Shanghai, which we formed in early 2004 to focus on developing mobile handsets based on the CDMA platform licensed from QUALCOMM. Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased to US$2.5 million in 2004 from US$0.7 million in 2003. The increase was due primarily to the hiring of additional engineers in anticipation of the growth of our wireless design service business, including 2.5G and 3G mobile handset designs based on the CDMA platform licensed from QUALCOMM. 43 Table of Contents Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased to US$0.7 million in 2004 from US$39,000 in 2003. The increase was due primarily to the increase in our selling and marketing staff and activities as we expanded our efforts to market and sell our services. Impairment of Acquired Intangible Assets. In 2003, we recorded an impairment charge related to impairment of acquired intangible assets in the amount of US$0.4 million, or 19.9% of the total amount of operating expenses in 2003. This expense reflected the one-time write-off of the then carrying value of the monochrome screen interface technology we acquired and then discontinued to use in 2003. We did not incur any such expense in 2004. Total Other Income (Loss), Net We incurred total other net income of US$0.5 million in 2004 as compared to total other net loss of US$9,000 in 2003, primarily due to the accrued interest expense and amortized discount related to the convertible notes issued in April 2004. Net Income Our net income increased to US$18.2 million in 2004 from US$5.0 million in 2003 as a result of the cumulative effect of the foregoing factors. B. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 8,716 $ 25,809 $ 16,950 Net cash used in investing activities (8,395 ) (8,112 ) (5,529 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 7,342 9,700 89,259 Effect of exchange rate changes 25 (10 ) 1,441 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 7,688 27,387 102,121 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 11 7,699 35,086 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 7,699 $ 35,086 $ 137,207 We have financed our operations through cash generated from our operating activities and securities issuances, including our initial public offering in May 2005. As of December 31, 2005, we had US$137.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand and bank deposits with terms of three months or less. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next twelve months. We may, however, require additional cash resources beyond the next twelve months due to higher than expected growth 44 Table of Contents in our business or other changing business conditions or future developments, including any possible investments or acquisitions. If our existing cash resources are insufficient to meet our requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity securities, debt securities or borrow from banks. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The sale of additional securities, including convertible debt securities, would result in additional dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. If we are unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing as required, our business, operations and prospects may suffer. The ability of our subsidiaries in China to convert RMB into U.S. dollars and make payments to us is subject to PRC foreign exchange regulations. Under these regulations, RMB is convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, security investment and repatriation of investment, however, is still subject to the approval of relevant PRC government authorities. TechFaith is a holding company and has no present plan to pay any cash dividends on its ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. See Item 8.A. of this annual report on Form 20-F, Financial Information ¾ Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information ¾ Dividend Policy. Nor does TechFaith have any loans or any other outstanding debts. Each of our operating subsidiaries in China fulfils its own cash obligations. Accordingly, we believe that the impact of PRC foreign exchange regulations on TechFaiths ability to meet its cash obligations is minimal. Operating Activities. Net cash provided from operating activities decreased substantially to US$17.0 million in 2005 from US$25.8 million in 2004. The decrease was due primarily to a substantial increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in advance from customers in 2005. Net cash provided from operating activities increased substantially to US$25.8 million in 2004 from US$8.7 million in 2003. The increase was due primarily to the increased operating income resulting from the significant increase in our wireless handset design service contracts and, to a lesser extent, to the significant increases in our component product sales and our royalty income. In connection with our design services, our customers typically pay us a portion of design fees immediately after the design contract is executed. We account such fees as advances from customers only until a pre-agreed milestone has been reached. Due to the increasing competition among mobile handset design houses, the percentage of the upfront design fees to the total design fees paid to us by our customers in connection with a mobile handset design project was smaller in 2005 as compared to 2004. As a result, the amount of advances from customers decreased by 86.2% to US$2.3 million in 2005 from US$16.4 million in 2004 even though design fee revenues increased by 113.7% during the same period. For the same reason, the amount of advances from customers increased by 175.8% to US$16.4 million in 2004 from US$6.0 million in 2003 even though design fee revenues increased by 271.2% during the same period. Our accounts receivable amounted to US$5.2 million, US$7.8 million and US$34.1 million as of December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Our inventories amounted to US$0.7 million, US$5.0 million and US$5.0 million as of December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. 45 Table of Contents Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased to US$5.5 million in 2005 from US$8.1 million in 2004. Our investing activities in 2005 primarily consist of the purchase of plant, machinery and equipment and intangible assets. Our investing activities in 2004 primarily consist of the purchase of plant, machinery and equipment and the purchase of intangible assets for our mobile handset design business. Net cash used in investing activities decreased slightly to US$8.1 million in 2004 from US$8.4 million in 2003. Our investing activities in 2003 primarily consist of capital expenditures in connection with the purchase of software, machinery and equipment, offset by the US$1.2 million received from sale of our equity interest in Beijing Qidi. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities increased significantly to US$89.3 million in 2005 from US$9.7 million in 2004. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2005 primarily consisted of net proceeds received from our initial public offering in May 2005. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by 32.1% to US$9.7 million in 2004 from US$7.3 million in 2003. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2004 primarily consisted of US$10.0 million from net issuance of interest-free convertible notes to three strategic investors in April 2004. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2003 primarily consisted of US$4.0 million from issuance of interest-free convertible notes to SeaBright and US$4.2 million from our shareholders as capital contribution to our subsidiaries in China, offset by our repayment of a short term loan in the amount of US$1.8 million to an unrelated party. Our capital expenditures amounted to US$5.6 million, US$6.2 million and US$9.4 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Our historical capital expenditure consisted principally of purchases of software, machinery, equipment and other items related to our mobile handset design services. We incurred capital expenditures totaling approximately US$9.4 million in 2005, which primarily consisted of plant and machinery, leasehold improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment. Our capital expenditure plans for 2006 have not yet been fixed, but we expect to spend approximately RMB160 million (US$20 million), primarily for acquiring premises in Beijing and Hangzhou. On March 23, 2006, we have entered into contracts to purchase six floors in a commercial building in Beijing for an aggregate consideration of approximately RMB89.8 million (US$11.1 million). Under these contracts, we are required to pay the seller of the property RMB50 million (US$6.2 million) by July 30, 2006 and the remainder by October 1, 2007. C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc. See Item 4.B. Information on the Company ¾ Business Overview. D. Trend Information Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events for the period from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2005 that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that caused the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions. 46 Table of Contents E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any outstanding off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency forward contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. F. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005: Payment Due by Period Less Than 1 More Than 5 Contractual Obligations Total Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Years (In thousands of U.S. dollars) Long-term debt obligations $ ¾ $ ¾ $ ¾ $ ¾ $ ¾ Operating lease obligations 5,035 1,787 2,927 321 ¾ Purchase obligations(1) 418 418 ¾ ¾ Investment obligations(2) 1,239 1,239 ¾ ¾ ¾ Total $ 6,692 $ 3,444 $ 2,927 $ 321 $ ¾ (1) Purchase obligations relating to the purchase of plant, machinery and equipment. (2) Investment obligations relating to contribution as paid-in-capital in a newly established affiliate. Other than the contractual obligations set forth above, we do not have any long-term commitments. G. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. Our risk exposure from changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest income generated by excess cash invested in short term bank deposits. Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. We have not been nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk. Substantially all of our revenues and substantially all our cost of revenues are denominated in RMB, with an immaterial portion of our cost of revenues denominated in the U.S. dollar. We have not had any material foreign exchange gains or losses. We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign exchange risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy has resulted in an approximately 2.5% appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar by the end of 2005. While the international reaction to the RMB revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. Any significant revaluation of RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings and financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our ADS in U.S. dollars. For example, an appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar would make any new RMB denominated investments or expenditures more costly to us, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for such purposes. 47 Table of Contents H. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R, which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on the grant-date fair values. The new standard, as recently amended, will be effective for us in the annual reporting period beginning after January 1, 2006. We have applied the provision of SFAS No. 123R and it did not have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of SFAS No. 143. FIN 47 clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity if the fair value can be reasonably estimated even though the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event. FIN 47 is required to be adopted for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2005. We are evaluating the effect of the adoption of FIN 47. It is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154) which replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinions No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements  An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes retrospective application, or the latest practicable date, as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2005, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a final consensus on Issue 04-13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty. EITF04-13 requires that two or more legally separate exchange transactions with the same counterparty be combined and considered a single arrangement for purposes of applying APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, when the transactions are entered into in contemplation of one another. EITF 04-13 is effective for new arrangements entered into, or modifications or renewals of existing arrangements, in interim or annual periods beginning after March 15, 2006. We do not expect this provision to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs  an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting that requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs, and spoilage costs to be recognized as current-period charges. It also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred on or after July 1, 2005. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. 48 Table of Contents In December 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets  an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 (SFAS 153), which amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetary assets exchanges occurring in fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees A.

The following table summarizes, as of June 23, 2006, the outstanding options granted under our 2005 Plan to our directors and senior executive officer named below since our board of directors adopted the 2005 Plan. Ordinary Shares Underlying Exercise Price Options Granted (US$/Share) Date of Grant Date of Expiration Hung Hsin (Robert) Chen 131,636 1.083 March 19, 2006 March 19, 2016 Peter Clarke 131,636 1.083 August 13, 2005 August 13, 2015 Jy-Ber Gilbert Lee 131,636 1.083 August 13, 2005 August 13, 2015 Total 394,908 The following paragraphs describe the principal terms of the 2005 plan. 52 Table of Contents Types of Awards. We may grant the following types of awards under our 2005 plan: § our ordinary shares; § options to purchase our ordinary shares; § restricted shares, which are non-transferable ordinary shares, subject to forfeiture upon termination of a grantees employment or service; § restricted share units, which represent the right to receive our ordinary shares at a specified date in the future, subject to forfeiture upon termination of a grantees employment or service; § share appreciation rights, which provide for the payment to the grantee based upon increases in the price of our ordinary shares over a set base price; and § dividend equivalent rights, which represent the value of the dividends per share that we pay. Awards may be designated in the form of ADSs instead of ordinary shares. If we designate an award in the form of ADSs, the number of shares issuable under the 2005 plan will be adjusted to reflect that one ADS represents 15 ordinary shares. Plan Administration. Our board of directors, or a committee designated by our board or directors, will administer the 2005 plan. The committee or the full board of directors, as appropriate, will determine the provisions and terms and conditions of each award grant. Award Agreement. Awards granted under our 2005 option plan are evidenced by an award agreement that sets forth the terms, conditions and limitations for each award. In addition, in the case of options, the award agreement also specifies whether the option constitutes an incentive stock option, or ISO, or a non-qualifying stock option. Eligibility. We may grant awards to employees, directors and consultants of our company or any of our related entities, which include our subsidiaries or any entities in which we hold a substantial ownership interest. However, we may grant options that are intended to qualify as ISOs only to our employees. Acceleration of Awards upon Corporate Transactions. The outstanding awards will accelerate upon occurrence of a change-of-control corporate transaction where the successor entity does not assume our outstanding awards under the 2005 plan. In such event, each outstanding award will become fully vested and immediately exercisable, and the transfer restrictions on the awards will be released and the repurchase or forfeiture rights will terminate immediately before the date of the change-of-control transaction. If the successor entity assumes our outstanding awards and later terminates the grantees service without cause within 12 months of the change-of-control transaction, the outstanding awards will automatically become fully vested and exercisable. Terms of Awards. In general, the plan administrator determines the exercise price of an option or the purchase price of the restricted shares and sets forth the price in the award agreement. The exercise price may be a fixed or variable price related to the fair market value of our ordinary shares. If we grant an ISO to an employee, who, at the time of that grant, 53 Table of Contents owns shares representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of our share capital, the exercise price cannot be less than 110% of the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the date of that grant. The term of each award shall be stated in the award agreement. The term of an award shall not exceed 10 years from the date of the grant. Vesting Schedule. In general, the plan administrator determines, or the award agreement specifies, the vesting schedule. Amendment and Termination. Our board of directors may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the 2005 plan. Amendments to the 2005 plan are subject to shareholder approval to the extent required by law, or stock exchange rules or regulations. Additionally, shareholder approval is specifically required to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the 2005 plan or to extend the term of an option beyond 10 years. Unless terminated earlier, the 2005 plan will expire and no further awards may be granted after the tenth anniversary of the shareholder approval of the 2005 plan. C.

Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions A. Major Shareholders Please refer to Item 6.E. Directors, Senior Management and Employees  Share Ownership. B. Related Party Transactions Transactions with Certain Directors and Officer On October 20, 2003, TechFaith China, and our directors Mr. Defu Dong and Mr. Jun Liu and our officer Mr. Yibo Fang entered into a patent application transfer agreement pursuant to which Mr. Defu Dong, Mr. Jun Liu and Mr. Yibo Fang agreed to transfer to TechFaith China without payment a patent application dated July 17, 2003 related to a new mobile handset design named Baby Handset. Issuance and Sale of Convertible Notes In April 2004, TechFaith BVI issued interest-free notes in the aggregate principal amount of US$14 million to HTF 7 Limited, QUALCOMM, SeaBright China Special Opportunities (I) Limited and Intel Capital Corporation, pursuant to a Note Subscription and Rights Agreement, or Subscription Agreement. The notes were convertible into our ordinary shares at any time with the initial conversion price of approximately US$0.21 per share, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement. Upon completion of our initial public offering on May 11, 2005, the notes were automatically converted into our ordinary shares pursuant to the then effective conversion price. We have granted the original holders of the notes customary registration rights, including demand and piggyback registration rights and Form F-3 registration rights. Set forth below are more detailed description of the registration rights. Demand Registration Rights. At any time commencing six months after our companys initial public offering, holders of a majority of the registrable securities have the right to demand that we file a registration statement covering the offer and sale of their securities, except other than pursuant to a registration statement on Form F-4 or S-8, so long as the aggregate amount of securities to be sold under the registration statement exceeds $5.0 million. However, we are not obligated to effect any such demand registration if we have within the six month period preceding the demand already effected a registration or if such holders had an opportunity to be included in a registration pursuant to their piggyback registration rights. We have the ability to delay or withdraw the filing of a registration statement for up to ninety days if our board of directors determines there is a valid business reason to delay such filing. We are not obligated to effect such demand registrations on more than two occasions. Form F-3 Registration Rights. Upon our company becoming eligible for use of Form F-3, holders of a majority of the registrable securities have the right to request we file a 57 Table of Contents registration statement under Form F-3. Such requests for registrations are not counted as demand registrations. Piggyback Registration Rights. If, at any time after our companys initial public offering, we propose to file a registration statement with respect to an offering for our own account, then we must offer each holder of the registrable securities the opportunity to include their shares in the registration statement, other than pursuant to a registration statement on Form F-4 or S-8. We must use our reasonable best efforts to cause the underwriters in any underwritten offering to permit any such shareholder who so requests to include their shares on the same terms and conditions as the securities of our company. Expenses of Registration. We will pay all expenses relating to any demand or piggyback registration, whether or not such registrations become effective; except, shareholders shall bear the expense of any brokers commission or underwriters discount or commission relating to registration and sale of their securities, and shall bear the fees and expenses of their own counsel. The registration rights and certain information rights of the note holders remain in effect after the completion of our initial public offering. However, all other rights set forth in the Subscription Agreement terminated automatically upon the completion of our initial public offering. Transactions with QUALCOMM In December 2003, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with QUALCOMM to confirm mutual intentions and understandings regarding the establishment of a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company to engage solely in CDMA-related business. Pursuant to this memorandum of understanding, we established TechFaith Shanghai in March 2004 and entered into several license agreements with QUALCOMM for the development of CDMA 1X mobile phones. Under these license agreements, we have obtained a non-exclusive license to manufacture, use and sell CDMA cards and components using certain intellectual property of QUALCOMM. In addition, we have obtained QUALCOMMs technical support for certain particular process technologies and design platforms. In March 2006, QUALCOMM and we entered into a joint venture by incorporating a Cayman Islands holding company named TechFaith Software (China) Holding Limited. QUALCOMM and we hold 30% and 70%, respectively, of this holding companys shares. In June 2006, TechFaith Software (China) Holding Limited formed a company, TechSoft, in China to develop application software for wireless devices. Pursuant to an agreement entered into on March 22, 2006 in relation to this joint venture with QUALCOMM, TechSoft will receive a total of US$35 million in funding by QUALCOMM and us. The US$35 million will comprise US$20 million in cash and US$15 million in non-cash in-kind contributions. TechSoft will be based in Beijing and Hangzhou, China. We became QUALCOMMs first independent handset design house partner in China, following an investment announced in April 2004. Initially focusing on 3G CDMA mobile handsets, TechSoft will operate as an independent entity. 58 Table of Contents Transactions with NEC On September 26, 2003, we entered into a joint venture agreement with NEC for the establishment of STEP Technologies, which was formed in November 2003. We contributed US$4.2 million and NEC contributed US$1.8 million as the registered capital of STEP Technologies, in return for a 70% and 30%, respectively, equity interest in STEP Technologies. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement, NECs consent is required for certain matters of STEP Technologies, including amendment of the articles of association, profit distribution or loss treatment, sale or transfer of intangible assets, and investment in any other entity. Since March 2003, we have entered into several business contracts with Wuhan NEC, a PRC subsidiary of NEC, pursuant to which we have provided mobile handset design services to Wuhan NEC. In 2003, 2004 and 2005, we derived net revenue of approximately US$4.1 million, US$14.9 million and US$40.6 million, respectively, from these business contracts. We entered into additional business contracts with NEC and its subsidiaries after completion of our initial public offering. In June 2004, we entered into a written agreement with Wuhan NEC, with respect to a mobile handset model we designed for and accepted by Wuhan NEC in December 2003. Under the agreement, we were required to pay Wuhan NEC US$1.5 million by October 29, 2004 to compensate its losses allegedly arising from the delay in the design schedule, certain software quality problems and changes of the initial design in the design process. At the time of execution of the agreement, it was the mutual understanding of both parties that Wuhan NEC would terminate the agreement and all of our obligations thereunder if the sales of the two new models of mobile handsets designed by us were satisfactory to Wuhan NEC. The sales of the two new models in September and October 2004 were satisfactory to Wuhan NEC and accordingly, Wuhan NEC orally agreed to terminate the agreement and all of our obligations thereunder in October 2004. We and Wuhan NEC entered into a new written agreement in December 2004 to affirm our previous oral agreements, clarify that the design quality issues were attributable to the components supplied by a third party and declare the June 2004 agreement to be void and ineffective from the date thereof. Transactions with SEF Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Defu Dong, co-founded Beijing Sino-Electronics Future Telecommunication R&D, Ltd., or SEF, a mobile handset design house, in February 2001.

Mr. Wensheng Tan is, and was at all relevant times, a shareholder of both our company and SEF. On September 18, 2003, Lenovo, SEF and TechFaith China entered into an agreement pursuant to which SEF assigned to TechFaith China and TechFaith China assumed without payment all the rights and obligations under three product technology development cooperation agreements entered into between Lenovo and SEF. Under the assignment and novation agreement, SEF agreed to act as a guarantor of the obligations of TechFaith China and continue to observe certain restrictions. On October 20, 2003, TechFaith China and SEF entered into five transfer agreements pursuant to which SEF agreed to transfer to TechFaith China without consideration three 59 Table of Contents patents and two patent applications that were principally developed by some employees of SEF who subsequently joined TechFaith China. On January 18, 2004, SEF, TechFaith China and Skyworks Solutions entered into an agreement pursuant to which SEF assigned to TechFaith China all the rights under an April 2002 development and license agreement between SEF and Skyworks Solutions in return for TechFaith Chinas payment of US$0.3 million to SEF. The consideration was determined based on the remaining pro rata share of the total license fee previously paid by SEF to Skyworks Solutions for the five year license period. We entered into a lease agreement dated July 31, 2003 with SEF with respect to part of our premises in Beijing. Our lease with SEF expired in December 2005 when the ownership of the property was transferred to another company. During the term of our lease, we were required to pay SEF a quarterly rent of US$34,177. In 2003, 2004 and 2005, we reimbursed SEF an aggregate amount of US$0.55 million, US$nil and US$nil million, respectively, for certain staff remuneration that SEF paid on behalf of our company before we established our statutory employee welfare reserve system under PRC law. Transactions with Beijing Qidi Transfer of Mobile Handset Design Contracts. We previously owned a 49% interest in Beijing Qidi, a company formed in September 2002 to provide wireless solutions to wireless manufacturers and brand owners in China. We sold our equity interest in Beijing Qidi to another shareholder of Beijing Qidi unrelated to us for US$1.2 million in September 2003. On December 5, 2003, Guangzhou Rowa Communication Company Limited, or Rowa, Beijing Qidi and TechFaith China entered into an agreement pursuant to which Beijing Qidi assigned and novated to TechFaith China, effective from January 1, 2004, all the rights and obligations under a mobile handset project cooperation agreement dated June 20, 2003 entered into between Rowa and Beijing Qidi, whereby Rowa engaged Beijing Qidi to design mobile handsets and agreed to pay Beijing Qidi design fees and royalties for its design services.

In September 2003, CECW, one of our competitors, sued Beijing Qidi, a former affiliate, and 18 individuals, including our director Baozhuang Huo, a former hardware design manager at CECW, in the Beijing First Intermediate Peoples Court, claiming that Beijing Qidi and the individuals had engaged in unfair competition. In December 2003, CECW also initiated arbitration proceedings against four individuals, including Mr. Huo, claiming that these individuals had violated the non-competition restrictions set forth in their respective employment agreements with CECW. In January 2004, we settled these claims with CECW on behalf of Beijing Qidi, Mr. Huo and the other individuals involved. In connection with the settlement, Beijing Qidi assigned three mobile handset project cooperation agreements to us. CECW subsequently withdrew all of its claims, and the litigation and arbitration were dismissed. Mr. Huo and several other individuals involved in the litigation joined our company in January 2004. The settlement was recorded as cost for the acquisition of intangible assets in our financial statements in 2004 at its cost, which estimated the fair market value of the intangible assets acquired in exchange for the settlement of this claim. Transactions with an Employee In 2005, we sold component products to a corporate customer, 30% of which is owned by one of our employees. Total net revenues for 2005 amounted to US$1.6 million and the related accounts receivable as of December 31, 2005 was US$1.6 million. C. Interests of Experts and Counsel Not applicable. Item 8.
