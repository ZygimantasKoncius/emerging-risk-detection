Item 1A. Risk Factors Changes in interest rates could adversely impact the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Companys ability to make a profit, like that of most financial institutions, substantially depends upon its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. However, certain assets and liabilities, may react differently to changes in market interest rates. Further, interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in broader market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets may lag behind. Additionally, some assets such as adjustable-rate mortgages, have features, and rate caps, which restrict changes in their interest rates. Factors such as inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, global disorder such as that experienced as a result of the terrorist activity on September 11, 2001, instability in domestic and foreign financial markets, and other factors beyond the Companys control, may affect interest rates. Changes in market interest rates will also affect the level of voluntary prepayments on loans and the receipt of payments on mortgage-backed securities, resulting in the receipt of proceeds that may have to be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage-backed security being prepaid. Although the Company pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to control its risk from changes in market interest rates, changes in interest rates can still have a material adverse effect on the Companys profitability. If the Company has higher loan losses than it has allowed for, its earnings could materially decrease. The Companys loan customers may not repay loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. The Company may therefore experience significant credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. The Company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the size of the allowance for loan losses, the Company relies on its experience and its evaluation of economic conditions. If its assumptions prove to be incorrect, its current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in its loan portfolio and adjustment may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in its loan portfolio. Consequently, a problem with one or more loans could require the Company to significantly increase the level of its provision for loan losses. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the Companys allowance for loan losses and may require it to increase its provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease the Companys net income. A significant amount of the Companys loans are concentrated in Massachusetts, and adverse conditions in this area could negatively impact its operations. Substantially all of the loans the Company originates are secured by properties located in or are made to businesses which operate in Massachusetts. Because of the current concentration of the Companys loan origination activities in Massachusetts, in the event of adverse economic conditions, potential downward pressure on housing prices, political or business developments or natural hazards that may affect Massachusetts and the ability of property owners and businesses in Massachusetts to make payments of principal and interest on the underlying loans, the Company would likely experience higher rates of loss and delinquency on its loans than if its loans were more geographically diversified, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition. The Company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely impacted by changes in law and regulations. The Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination. See Regulation in Item 1 hereof, Business. Any change in the laws or regulations and failure by the Company to comply with applicable law and regulation, or a change in regulators supervisory policies or examination procedures, whether by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, other state or federal regulators, the United States Congress, or the Massachusetts legislature could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company has strong competition within its market area which may limit the Companys growth and profitability. The Company faces significant competition both in attracting deposits and in the origination of loans. See Market Area and Competition in Item 1 hereof, Business. Commercial banks, credit unions, savings 18 Table of Contents banks, savings and loan associations operating in our primary market area have historically provided most of our competition for deposits. Competition for the origination of real estate and other loans come from other commercial banks, thrift institutions, insurance companies, finance companies, other institutional lenders and mortgage companies. The success of the Company is dependent on hiring and retaining certain key personnel. The Companys performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. The Company relies on key personnel to manage and operate its business, including major revenue generating functions such as loan and deposit generation. The loss of key staff may adversely affect the Companys ability to maintain and manage these functions effectively, which could negatively affect the Companys revenues. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which could cause a decrease in the Companys net income. The Companys continued ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate its existing employees. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None
