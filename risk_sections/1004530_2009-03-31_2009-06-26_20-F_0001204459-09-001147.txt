D. Risk factors. The Company, and thus the securities of the Company, should be considered a highly speculative investment and investors should carefully consider all of the information disclosed in this Annual Report prior to making an investment in the Company. In addition to the other information presented in this Annual Report, the following risk factors should be given special consideration when evaluating an investment in any of the 2 Company's securities. Any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and on the market price of its common stock. (a) The Company's limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate the Company's current business and forecast future results. The Company has only a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of the Company's current business and prospects, each of which should be considered in light of the risks, expenses and problems frequently encountered in the early stages of growth of all companies, and in mining companies in particular. The Company has not commenced mining operations and is still in the exploratory and permitting stage. The Company may not be able to obtain all of the permits which are necessary for it to commence oprations. The Companys mining operations may not be successful. As a result of this limited operating history, period-to-period comparisons of the Companys operating results may not be meaningful and the results for any particular period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. (b) The diamond mining business is speculative and the Company may not be successful in implementing its plans to establish a successful and profitable diamond mining business Resource exploration and possible development is a speculative business, characterized by a number of significant risks including, among other things, unprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits but from finding mineral deposits which, though present, are insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production. Diamonds acquired or discovered by the Company may be required to be sold to The Diamond Trading Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of De Beers, as per the Gahcho Kué Joint Venture Agreement (see Item 4D - Property, plant and equipment - Principal Properties - The AK Property), at a price which is reflective of the market at that time. (c) The Company has no significant source of operating cash flow and failure to generate revenues in the future could cause the Company to go out business. The Company currently has no significant source of operating cash flow. The Company has limited financial resources. The Company's ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate revenues. The Companys current operations do not generate any cash flow. The Companys annual operating costs are approximately $1.3 million. (d) Exploration and Development The Company's properties are primarily in the advanced exploration and permitting stage. Company mining operations may never become profitable. Drilling of the 5034, Hearne and Tuzo kimberlite pipes has been extensive and has now been completed. There are no estimates of reserves. Estimates of mineral deposits, development plans and production costs, when made, can be affected by such factors as environmental permit regulations and requirements, weather, environmental factors, unforeseen technical difficulties, unusual or unexpected geological formations and work interruptions. In addition, the grade of diamonds ultimately discovered may differ from that indicated by bulk sampling results. Mine plans and processing concepts that have been developed are preliminary in nature. (e) The preliminary process testing may not be accurate in predicting the actual presence and recoverability of diamonds on Company properties. Process testing is limited to small scale testing based on a number of laboratory test programs, trade-off studies and design evaluations conducted in 2002 and 2004. Ore dressing study technical investigations were performed on kimberlite from the 5034 and Hearne pipes. A database of operating information developed during the 1999/2000 bulk sample processing of 2,000 tonnes of kimberlite was used to supplement the ore dressing study data. Limited processing data is available for the Tuzo and Telsa kimberlites. Process plant studies were conducted during the course of 2005. There can be no assurance that diamonds recovered in small scale tests will be duplicated in large scale tests under on-site conditions or in production scale. 3 Difficulties may be experienced in obtaining the expected diamond recoveries when scaling up to a production scale process plant. (f) The Company currently does not have adequate funds to explore properties other than the Gahcho Kué Project. Except for the Gahcho Kué Project where project costs are paid by De Beers, the Company does not have the ability to pay for exploration or development costs on its other properties. If if such funds were available, there is no assurance that expending such funds would result in discovery of any diamondiferous kimberlite. (g) The Company has a history of losses and is likely to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. The Company has a history of losses and is likely to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. During the years ended March 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company incurred net losses or earnings during each of the following periods: • $1.538 million net loss for the year ended March 31, 2009. • $0.166 million net earnings for the year ended March 31, 2008. • $1.961 million net loss for the year ended March 31, 2007. As of March 31, 2009, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $27.5 million. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. None of the Company's properties have advanced to the commercial production stage, and the Company has no history of earnings or cash flow from operations and, as an exploration company, has only a history of losses. (h) The Company may never recover the amounts it has capitalized for mineral property costs The recoverability of the amounts capitalized for mineral properties in the Company's consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, is dependent upon the ability of the Company to complete exploration and development, the discovery of economically recoverable reserves, and, if warranted, upon future profitable production or proceeds from disposition of some or all of the Company's mineral properties. (i) The Companys failure to generate revenues in the future could cause the Company to go out of business. As of March 31, 2009, the Company had cash and short-term investment of approximately $0.297 million and working capital of approximately $0.2 million. During the past three fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, the Company has used approximately $3.4 million in cash flows in operating activities including approximately $1.142 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, $1.230 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, and $0.978 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. The Company's administrative and other expenses are expected to be approximately $1.3 million for the next year. The Company will be required to raise additional capital through equity and/or debt financings in the very near future on terms that may be dilutive to its shareholders' interests in the Company and to the value of their common shares. The Company may consider debt financing, joint ventures, production sharing arrangements, disposing of properties or other arrangements to meet its capital requirements in the future. Such arrangements may have a material adverse affect on the Company's business or results of operations. As well, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise additional capital, or to raise additional capital on terms and conditions which it finds acceptable. If the Company is not able to raise sufficient capital, it may not be able to grow the Company, or it may be forced to cease doing business. 4 (j) The Companys properties have no proven reserves The properties in which the Company has an interest are all in the advanced exploratory and permitting stage and at this point, there are only indicated and inferred resources in four kimberlite bodies in Kennady Lake. See Item 4D - Property, plants and equipment - Principal Properties. The Company has not yet determined whether its mineral properties contain mineral reserves that are economically recoverable. Failure to discover economically recoverable reserves will require the Company to write-off costs capitalized in its financial statements. (k) If the Company does not hold good title to properties, its ability to explore and eventually mine them could be prevented or restricted. The Companys business depends upon having clear title to its properties and its ability to explore and mine its properties without undue restriction. If any of its properties are subject to prior unregistered agreements that restrict the use of the properties, or if it does not hold title to the properties as it believes it does, its ability to explore and mine on those properties could be limited or prevented completely. This would have a material adverse effect on the business and its results of operation. (l) Diamond prices can fluctuate significantly, and as a result, the Companys results of operation may fluctuate significantly. The market for rough diamonds is subject to strong influence from the world's largest diamond producing company, De Beers, of South Africa, and from The Diamond Trading Co., (formerly known as the Central Selling Organization), a marketing agency controlled by De Beers. The price of diamonds has historically fluctuated. The price of diamonds dropped sharply after September 11, 2001 and had recovered, but future prices cannot be predicted. Between 2003 and 2006 diamond prices increased on average by approximately 15%. In 2007, rough diamond prices increased by an average of 25%, and in the first five months of 2008, by a further 11%. From about mid-2008 to mid-April 2009, rough diamond prices fell sharply with concerns of the global economic environment of the time. Starting in mid-April 2009, rough diamond prices have started to rebound, tempered by concerns of consumer buying confidence and behaviour. Because of such fluctuations, the Companys results of operation may fluctuate significantly. (m) The Company may incur significant costs to comply with Environmental and Government Regulation The current and anticipated future operations of the Company, including development activities and commencement of production on its properties, require permits from various federal, territorial and local governmental authorities and such operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations governing prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labour standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety and other matters. Companies engaged in the development and operation of mines and related facilities generally experience increased costs, and delays in production and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits. The Company's exploration activities and its potential mining and processing operations in Canada are subject to various Canadian Federal and Territorial laws governing land use, the protection of the environment, prospecting, development, production, exports, taxes, labour standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, mine safety and other matters. Such operations and exploration activities are also subject to substantial regulation under these laws by governmental agencies and may require that the Company obtain permits from various governmental agencies. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with all material laws and regulations which currently apply to its activities. There can be no assurance, however, that all permits which the Company may require for construction of mining facilities and conduct of mining operations will be obtainable on reasonable terms or that such laws and regulations, or that new legislation or modifications to existing legislation, would not have an adverse effect on any exploration or mining project which the Company might undertake. Further detail on governmental regulation may be found in Item 4 - Business Review - Government Regulation, below. 5 Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permit requirements may result in enforcement actions thereunder, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. Parties engaged in mining operations may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violation of applicable laws or regulations. The amount of funds required to comply with all environmental regulations and to pay for compensation in the event of a breach of such laws may exceed the Company's ability to pay such amount. Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of mining companies, or more stringent implementation of existing or new laws, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and cause increases in capital expenditures or production costs or reduction in levels of production at producing properties or require abandonment or delays in development of new mining properties. (n) Climate and transportation costs may increase and have a negative effect on the Companys results of operation. The Gahcho Kué Project is subject to climate and transportation risks because of its remote northern location. Such factors can add to the cost of exploration, development and operation, thereby increasing costs and negatively affecting profitability. (o) The Company is dependent upon its joint venture partner for the success of the Gahcho Kué Project.r The Company, and the success of the Gahcho Kué Project, are dependent on the efforts, expertise and capital resources of our joint venture partner, De Beers Canada, and its parent De Beers. De Beers Canada is the project operator and is responsible for exploring, permitting, developing and operating the Gahcho Kué Project. In additional, De Beers Canada is providing critical financing for the project. The Company is dependent on De Beers Canada for accurate information about the Gahcho Kué Project, and the proper and timely progress of exploration, permitting and development. (p) Operating Hazards and Risks Diamond exploration involves many risks. Operations in which the Company has a direct or indirect interest will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration, development and production of resources, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to property and possible environmental damage. (q) There are numerous factors beyond the control of the Company affect the marketability of any diamonds discovered. Factors beyond the control of the Company may affect the marketability of any diamonds produced. Significant price movements over short periods of time may be affected by numerous factors beyond the control of the Company, including international economic and political trends, expectations of inflation, currency exchange fluctuations (specifically, the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar and other currencies), interest rates and global or regional consumption patterns. The effect of these factors on the prices of diamonds and therefore the economic viability of any of the Company's projects cannot accurately be predicted. (r) The Company's expectations reflected in forward looking statements may prove to be incorrect. This Form 20-F includes "forward looking statements". A shareholder or prospective shareholder should bear this in mind when assessing the Company's business. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this annual report, including, without limitation, the statements under and located elsewhere herein regarding industry prospects and the Company's financial position are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable, such expectations may prove to be incorrect. 6 (s) The Mineral Resources Industry is intensely competitive and the Company competes with many company that have greater financial means and technical facilities. The resource industry is intensely competitive in all of its phases, and the Company competes with many companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities. Competition could adversely affect the Company's ability to acquire suitable producing properties or prospects for exploration in the future. The Company may be required under the Gahcho Kué Joint Venture Agreement (see Item 4B - Information on the Company - Business Overview) to sell its rough diamonds at a price that is reflective of the market price, to The Diamond Trading Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of De Beers, which controls approximately 50% of the diamond market. There may therefore be no competition for diamonds produced from the Company's properties. The Company only competes in the acquisition of new properties. (t) Financing Risks. The Company's current operations do not generate any cash flow. As the Company seeks additional equity financing, the issuance of additional shares will dilute the interests of the Company's current shareholders. The amount of the dilution would depend on the number of new shares issued and the price at which they are issued. The Company has successfully raised funds in recent years through share, option and warrant issuances. As of March 31, 2009, the Company had cash and short-term investment of approximately $0.297 million and working capital of approximately $0.2 million. Subsequent to March 31, 2009, certain directors and officers exercised 165,365 outstanding options for total proceeds of $208,360 in order to provide additional liquidity to the Company for near term requirements. The Company is currently investigating various sources of additional liquidity to increase the cash balances required for ongoing operations over the foreseeable future. These additional sources include, but are not limited to, share offerings, private placements, credit facilities, and debt, as well as further possible exercises of outstanding options by directors and officers. The Companys annual cash operating costs are approximately $1.3 million. (u) If outstanding options to buy Company stock are exercised, existing shareholders interests in the Company will be diluted. As at June 25, 2009, there were 1,134,635 options outstanding with exercise prices ranging from $1.26 to $4.50 (expiring at various dates). There were no warrants outstanding. The stock options, if fully exercised, would increase the number of shares outstanding by 1,134,635. Such options, if fully exercised, would constitute about 2% (out of 61,232,381 shares (60,097,746 issued and outstanding, plus total outstanding options) respectively) of the Company's resulting share capital as at June 25, 2009. It is unlikely that options would be exercised unless the market price of the Company's common shares exceeds the exercise price at the date of exercise. The exercise of such options and the subsequent resale of such Common shares in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price and the Company's ability to raise equity capital in the future at a time and price which it deems appropriate. The Company may also enter into commitments in the future which would require the issuance of additional common shares and the Company may grant new share purchase warrants and stock options. Any share issuances from the Company's treasury will result in immediate dilution to existing shareholders. (v) Members of our Board of Directors may have outside interests which conflict with the Company or its shareholders. Patrick Evans and Jennifer Dawson have Consulting Agreements with the Company (see Item 6C - Board Practices). In addition, certain officers and directors of the Company are associated with other natural resource companies that acquire interests in mineral properties.. Such associations may give rise to conflicts of interest from time to time. (w) If the Company is not able to attract and maintain qualified key management personnel, it may not be able to successfully implement its planned business activities and growth. The nature of the Company's business, its ability to continue its exploration and development activities and to thereby develop a competitive edge in its marketplace depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and 7 maintain qualified key management personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain such personnel. The Company's development to date has depended, and in the future will continue to depend, on the efforts of Patrick Evans. See Item 7B -Related party transactions and Item 6C - Board Practices. Loss of the key person could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company does not maintain key-man life insurance on Patrick Evans. (x) The Companys stock price is subject to significant fluctuations. Prices for the Company's shares on the TSX and on the NYSE Amex, have been extremely volatile. The price for the Company's common shares on the TSX ranged from $0.75 (low) and $5.05 (high) during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, and from $3.79 (low) to $5.93 (high) during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. The price on the NYSE Amex ranged from $0.58 US (low) and $4.95 US (high) during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, and from $3.54 US (low) to $5.49 US (high) during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. Any investment in the Company's securities is therefore subject to considerable fluctuations in value. (y) The Company has not paid dividends in the past and does not anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future. Since our inception, we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay any dividends on our common stock, our shareholder will be able to profit from an investment only if the price of the stock appreciates before the shareholder sells it. (z) Currency rate fluctuations may have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and timing of the development of the Companys properties. Feasibility and other studies conducted to evaluate the Company's properties are denominated in U.S. dollars, and the Company conducts a significant portion of its operations and incurs a significant portion of its administrative and operating costs in Canadian dollars. The exchange rate for converting U.S. dollars into Canadian dollars has fluctuated in recent years. Accordingly, the Company is subject to fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, and these fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange may materially affect the Company's financial position, results of operations and timing of the development of its properties. In particular, the recent strong increase in the value of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar should be expected to have a material impact on projected future capital and operating costs, which could impact on the economic viability of the Gahcho Kué Project. (aa) De Beers Support The exploration of the Gahcho Kué Project has been primarily funded by De Beers, and De Beers Canada has made an equity investment in the Company. However, there is no assurance that the level of support provided by De Beers will continue in the future. (bb) It will be difficult for any shareholder of our Company to commence legal activation against our esecutives. Enforcing judgments won against them or the Company will be difficult. As the Company is a Canadian company, it may be difficult for U.S. shareholders of the Company to effect service of process on the Company or to realize on judgments obtained against the Company in the United States. Some of its directors and officers are residents of Canada and a significant part of its assets are, or will be, located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for shareholders resident in the United States to effect service of process within the United States upon the Company, directors, officers or experts who are not residents of the United States, or to realize in the United States judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon civil liability of any of the Company, directors or officers under the United States federal securities laws. If a judgment is obtained in the U.S. courts based on civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against the Company or its directors or officers it will be difficult to enforce the judgment in the Canadian courts against the Company and any of the Company's non-U.S. resident executive officers or directors. Accordingly, United States shareholders may be forced to bring actions against 8 the Company and its respective directors and officers under Canadian law and in Canadian courts in order to enforce any claims that they may have against the Company or its directors and officers. Subject to necessary registration, as an extra provincial company, under applicable provincial corporate statutes in the case of a corporate shareholder, Canadian courts do not restrict the ability of non-resident persons to sue in their courts. Nevertheless it may be difficult for United States shareholders to bring an original action in the Canadian courts to enforce liabilities based on the U.S. federal securities laws against the Company and any of the Company's Canadian executive officers or directors. (cc) Our common stock may be delisted from NYSE Amex, and if this occurs, shareholders may have difficulty converting their investment into cash efficiently. NYSE Amex has established certain standards for the continued listing of a security on this exchange. If our common stock were to be excluded from NYSE Amex, the prices of our common stock and the ability of shareholders to sell such stock would be adversely affected. As well, the Company would be required to comply with the initial listing requirements to be relisted on NYSE Amex. Item
