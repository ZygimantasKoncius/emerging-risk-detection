Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially from what we 4projected. Consequently, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation (and expressly disclaim any such obligation) to update or revise the forward-looking statements, except as required by federal securities laws.GLOSSARY OF SELECTED MINING TERMSABMet. Advanced Biological Metals Removal System. A technology utilized for selenium water treatment, which was developed by General Electric.ACOE. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before deducting interest income and expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization; asset retirement obligation expense; sales contract accretion; impairment and restructuring charge; DIP financing fees; and reorganization items.Bituminous coal. The most common type of coal with moisture content less than 20% by weight and heating value of 10,500 to 14,000 Btu per pound.British thermal unit, or “Btu.” A measure of the thermal energy required to raise the temperature of one pound of pure liquid water one degree Fahrenheit at the temperature at which water has its greatest density (39 degrees Fahrenheit).Carbon dioxide (CO2). A gaseous chemical compound that is generated as a by-product of the combustion of fossil fuels or the burning of vegetable matter, among other processes.Central Appalachia. The bituminous coal producing states and regions of eastern Kentucky, eastern Tennessee, western Virginia and southern West Virginia.CERCLA. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.Coal ash. Impurities consisting of iron, aluminum and other incombustible matter that are contained in coal. Since ash increases the weight of coal, it adds to the cost of handling and can affect the burning characteristics of coal.Coal seam. Coal deposits occur in layers typically separated by layers of rock. Each layer is called a “seam.” A coal seam can vary in thickness from inches to a hundred feet or more.Coke. A hard, dry carbon substance produced by heating coal to a very high temperature in the absence of air. Coke is used in the manufacture of iron and steel. Its production results in a number of useful by-products.Complex. An area with one or more company-operated mines and/or contractor-operated mines as well as a preparation plant.Continuous miner. An underground mining machine that removes coal from the face.Continuous miner mining. An underground method in which airways and transportation entries are developed by continuous mining machines, leaving “pillars” to support the roof. Continuous miner mining is also referred to as “room-and-pillar” mining. Pillars may subsequently be extracted to maximize the reserve recovery. This method is often used to mine smaller coal reserves or thinner seams.Dragline. A large machine used in the surface mining process to remove the overburden, or layers of earth and rock covering a coal seam. The dragline has a large bucket suspended from the end of a long boom. The bucket, which is suspended by cables, is able to scoop up substantial amounts of overburden as it is dragged across the excavation area.Dragline mining. An efficient surface method that uses large capacity draglines to remove overburden to expose the coal seams. Once mined, the coal is loaded into haul trucks for transportation to a preparation plant or transportation to a loading facility.EPA. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Face. Commonly used to describe the exposed area of a coal seam from which coal is extracted.FBR. Fluidized Bed Reactor. A technology utilized for selenium water treatment.Force majeure. An event not anticipated as of the date of the applicable contract, which is not within the reasonable control of the party affected by such event, that partially or entirely prevents such party’s ability to perform its contractual 5obligations. During the duration of the force majeure, the obligations of the party affected by the event may be excused to the extent required.Fossil fuel. Fuel such as coal, petroleum or natural gas formed from the fossil remains of organic material.Geologic conditions. The physical nature of the coal seam and surrounding strata and their effects on the mining process. Geologic conditions that can have an adverse effect on underground mining include thinning coal seam thickness, rock partings within a coal seam, weak roof or floor rock, sandstone channel intrusions, groundwater and increased stresses within the surrounding rock mass due to over mining, under mining and overburden changes.Highwall mining. A surface mining method generally utilized in conjunction with truck-and-shovel/loader surface mining. As the highwall is exposed by the truck-and-shovel/loader operation, a modified continuous miner with an attached auger conveyor system cuts horizontal passages from the highwall into the coal seam. These passages can penetrate to a maximum depth of up to 1,600 feet, but generally average 1,000 to 1,200 feet.High vol metallurgical coal. Coal with volatile matter greater than approximately 30%. Volatile matter refers to the impurities that become gaseous when heated to certain temperatures.IFSeR. Iron Facilitated Selenium Reduction. A technology utilized for selenium water treatment.Illinois Basin. The bituminous coal producing states and regions of Illinois, Indiana and western Kentucky.Longwall mining. An underground mining method that uses hydraulic shields, varying from five feet to twelve feet in height, to support the roof of the mine while a shearing machine traverses the coal face removing a two to three foot slab of coal with each pass. An armored face conveyer then moves the coal to a standard deep mine conveyer system for delivery to the surface. Longwall mining is highly productive, but it is effective only for large blocks of medium to thick coal seams.Low vol metallurgical coal. Coal with volatile matter between approximately 16% and 22%. Volatile matter refers to the impurities that become gaseous when heated to certain temperatures.Metallurgical coal. The various grades of coal suitable for carbonization to make coke for steel manufacture. Also known as “met” coal and “coking” coal, it possesses four important qualities: volatility, which affects coke yield; the level of impurities, which affects coke quality; composition, which affects coke strength; and basic characteristics, which affect coke oven safety. Metallurgical coal generally has a particularly high Btu heat content, but low ash and sulfur content.Mid vol metallurgical coal. Coal with volatile matter between approximately 24% and 28%. Volatile matter refers to the impurities that become gaseous when heated to certain temperatures.MSHA. U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration.Northern Appalachia. The bituminous coal producing states and regions of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Maryland and the northern part of West Virginia.NPDES. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.OSM. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. Administers the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) and establishes mining, environmental protection and reclamation standards for all aspects of U.S. surface mining as well as many aspects of underground mining.Outfall. A water discharge point authorized in a NPDES permit. In the case of coal mining, the discharge point is often a pipe or channel that discharges water from a sediment control structure. Also referred to as an “outlet.”Overburden. Layers of earth and rock covering a coal seam. In surface mining operations, overburden is removed prior to coal extraction.OVEC. Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, Inc.Pillar. An area of coal left to support the overlying strata in an underground mine, sometimes left permanently to support surface structures.Preparation plant. A facility for crushing, sizing and washing coal to remove rock and other impurities to prepare it for use by a particular customer. Preparation plants are usually located on a mine site, although one plant may serve several mines. The washing process has the added benefit of removing some of the coal’s sulfur content.6Reclamation. The process of restoring land and the environment to their original state following mining activities. The process commonly includes “recontouring” or reshaping the land to its approximate original appearance, restoring topsoil and planting native grass and ground covers. Reclamation operations are usually underway before the mining of a particular site is completed. Reclamation is closely regulated by both state and federal law.Roof. In an underground mine, the stratum of rock or other mineral above a coal seam; the overhead surface of a coal mine working area.Roof bolting. A method of supporting the roof of underground mines by inserting long steel bolts into holes bored into the overlying strata forming a more stable roof by creating a composite beam.Selenium. A naturally occurring element that is encountered in earthmoving operations. The extent of selenium occurrence varies depending upon site-specific geologic conditions. Selenium is encountered globally in coal mining, phosphate mining and agricultural operations. In coal mining applications, selenium can be discharged to surface water when mine tailings are exposed to rain and other natural elements. Selenium effluent limits are included in permits issued to us and other coal mining companies.SMCRA. Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.Sulfur. One of the elements present in varying quantities in coal that reacts with air when coal is burned to form sulfur dioxide.Sulfur dioxide (SO2). A gaseous by-product of coal combustion.Surface mine. A mine in which the coal lies near the surface and can be extracted by removing the covering layer of earth and rock (see “Overburden”).Thermal coal. Coal used by power plants and industrial steam boilers to produce electricity, steam or both. It generally is lower in Btu heat content and higher in volatile matter than metallurgical coal. Also known as “steam” coal.Tons. A “short” or net ton is equal to 2,000 pounds. A “long” or British ton is equal to 2,240 pounds; a “metric” ton (also called a “tonne”) is approximately 2,205 pounds. The short ton is the unit of measure referred to in our filings.Truck-and-Shovel/Loader mining. A surface mining method that uses large electric- or diesel-powered shovels to remove overburden. Loading equipment is used to load coal into haul trucks for transportation to the preparation plant or transportation loading facility. Productivity depends on equipment, geological composition and the ratio of overburden to coal.UMWA. United Mine Workers of America.Underground mine. Also known as a “deep” mine. Usually located several hundred feet below the earth’s surface, an underground mine’s coal is removed mechanically and transferred by shuttle car or conveyor to the surface.WVDEP. West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection.ZVI. Zero Valent Iron. A technology utilized for selenium water treatment.7PART IUnless the context indicates otherwise, all references in this report to Patriot, the Company, us, we, or our include Patriot Coal Corporation and our subsidiaries (Patriot). Refer to the Glossary on pages 5 through 7 for the definition of mining terms used throughout this document.Item 1. Business.OverviewWe are a producer of coal in the eastern United States (U.S.), with operations and coal reserves in the Appalachia and the Illinois Basin coal regions. Our principal business is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal and metallurgical coal. Thermal coal is primarily sold to electricity generators, and metallurgical coal is sold to steel mills and independent coke producers.As of December 31, 2012, our operations consisted of eleven active mining complexes. Our operations include company-operated mines, contractor-operated mines and coal preparation facilities. The Appalachia and Illinois Basin segments consist of our operations in West Virginia and Kentucky, respectively. We control approximately 1.8 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves. Our proven and probable coal reserves include metallurgical coal and medium and high-Btu thermal coal, with low, medium and high sulfur content.We ship coal to electricity generators, industrial users, steel mills and independent coke producers, as well as brokers that ultimately sell the coal to these same types of customers. In 2012, we sold 24.9 million tons of coal, of which 75% was sold to domestic and global electricity generators and industrial customers and 25% was sold to domestic and global steel and coke producers. Export sales were 45% of our total volume in 2012. Coal is shipped via various company-owned and third-party loading facilities, multiple rail and river transportation routes and ocean-going vessels.Effective October 31, 2007, Patriot was spun off from Peabody Energy Corporation (Peabody) and became a separate, publicly-traded company. This transaction is referred to in this Form 10-K as the “distribution” or the “spin-off.” The spin-off from Peabody was accomplished through a dividend of all outstanding shares of Patriot.On July 23, 2008, Patriot completed the acquisition of Magnum Coal Company (Magnum). Magnum was one of the largest coal producers in Appalachia, operating eight mining complexes with production from surface and underground mines in Appalachia and controlling more than 600 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. Magnum results are included as of the date of the acquisition.Bankruptcy ProceedingsOn July 9, 2012 (the Petition Date), Patriot Coal Corporation, as a stand-alone entity, and substantially all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Filing Subsidiaries and, together with Patriot, the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (the Chapter 11 Petitions) under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The Debtors’ Chapter 11 cases are being jointly administered under the caption In re: Patriot Coal Corporation, et al. (Case No. 12-51502) (the Bankruptcy Case). Our joint ventures and certain of our other subsidiaries (collectively, the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries) were not included in the Chapter 11 filing.On July 18, 2012 and August 7, 2012, respectively, the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) and several surety companies filed motions requesting that the venue for our Chapter 11 filing be transferred to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The U.S. Trustee also filed a motion arguing that the venue should be transferred from the Southern District of New York to another district. A hearing was held in September 2012, at which time the Company, the Creditors’ Committee and certain other creditors contested these motions. On November 27, 2012, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York issued a ruling transferring the bankruptcy cases to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. On December 19, 2012, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York entered an order formally transferring the bankruptcy cases to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and/or the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, as applicable, the Bankruptcy Court).Effective July 10, 2012, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) suspended trading of our common stock and commenced proceedings to delist our common stock. On August 6, 2012, our common stock was delisted from the NYSE. Our stock is now traded under the ticker symbol “PCXCQ” on the OTCQB marketplace, operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (the OTC Market).8The filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions constituted an event of default under the Company’s pre-petition debt obligations, and those debt obligations became automatically and immediately due and payable, although any actions to enforce such payment obligations are stayed as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions. Due to the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions, the Company’s pre-petition unsecured long-term debt of $458.5 million is included in “Liabilities subject to compromise” in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012.The Debtors are currently operating as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. In general, the Debtors are authorized to, and continue to, operate as an ongoing business, but may not engage in transactions outside of the ordinary course of business without the approval of the Bankruptcy Court.Debtor-In-Possession (DIP) FinancingIn connection with filing the Chapter 11 Petitions, the Debtors filed a motion seeking, among other things, Bankruptcy Court authorization to obtain post-petition financing, and for each Filing Subsidiary (other than EACC Camps, Inc.) and for Patriot Ventures LLC (collectively, the DIP Guarantors) to guaranty our obligations in connection with the DIP financing, up to an aggregate principal amount of $802.0 million, consisting of (a) a revolving credit loan in an amount not to exceed $125.0 million (First Out Revolving Credit Loan), (b) a term loan in the amount of $375.0 million (First Out Term Loan, and together with the First Out Revolving Credit Loan, the First Out Facility), and (c) a $302.0 million roll up (the L/C Roll Up) of obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated May 5, 2010 (the Pre-Petition Credit Agreement) in respect to outstanding letters of credit, inclusive of any obligations as to reimbursement, renewal and extension of the same issued in the aggregate amount of $300.8 million as of the Petition Date (the Second Out Facility and, together with the First Out Facility, the DIP Facilities).On July 11, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court entered an interim order (the Interim DIP Order) that, among other things, authorized us to borrow money and obtain letters of credit pursuant to the DIP Facilities and to guaranty such borrowings and our obligations with respect to such letters of credit, up to an aggregate principal or face amount of $677.0 million (plus interest, fees and other expenses and amounts), consisting of borrowings of up to an aggregate principal or face amount of $125.0 million under the First Out Revolving Credit Loan, $250.0 million under the First Out Term Loan, and up to $302.0 million under the Second Out Facility, in accordance with the terms of the Interim DIP Order. On August 3, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court entered a final order (the Final DIP Order) that, among other things, authorized us to borrow the full amount under the DIP Facilities in accordance with the terms of the Final DIP Order. The maturity date of the DIP Facilities is October 4, 2013, but may be extended to December 31, 2013 provided certain conditions are met.Reorganization ProcessThe Bankruptcy Court authorized us to pay certain of our pre-petition obligations, including payments for employee wages, salaries and certain benefits and payments to certain shippers and critical vendors, subject to certain limitations. The Debtors are required to pay vendors and other providers in the ordinary course for goods and services received after the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions and to pay certain other business-related payments necessary to maintain the operation of our business. We have retained legal and financial professionals to advise us on the bankruptcy proceedings. From time to time, we may seek the Bankruptcy Court’s approval for the retention of additional professionals.Immediately after filing the Chapter 11 Petitions, we began notifying all known current or potential creditors of the Debtors of the bankruptcy filings. Subject to certain exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions automatically enjoined, or stayed, the continuation of any judicial or administrative proceedings or other actions against the Debtors or their property to recover, collect or secure a claim arising prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions. Thus, for example, most creditor actions to obtain possession of property from us, or to create, perfect or enforce any lien against our property, or to collect on monies owed or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with respect to a pre-petition claim are enjoined unless and until the Bankruptcy Court lifts the automatic stay.As required by the Bankruptcy Code, the U.S. Trustee for the Southern District of New York appointed an official committee of unsecured creditors (the Creditors’ Committee). The Creditors’ Committee and its legal representatives have a right to be heard on all matters that come before the Bankruptcy Court.Under Section 365 and other relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Code, we may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real property and equipment, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. In this context, “assumption” means that the Company agrees to perform its obligations and cure all existing defaults under the contract or lease, and “rejection” means that it is relieved from its obligations to perform further under the contract or lease, but is subject to a pre-petition claim for damages for 9the breach thereof subject to certain limitations. Any damages resulting from rejection of executory contracts that are permitted to be recovered under the Bankruptcy Code will be treated as liabilities subject to compromise unless such claims were secured prior to the Petition Date.Since the Petition Date, the Company received approval from the Bankruptcy Court to reject a number of equipment leases and other executory contracts of various types. On January 15, 2013, the Company filed a motion for authorization to assume or reject all of our unexpired leases of nonresidential real property, including our coal reserve leases. Substantially all of our assumptions and rejections were approved by the Bankruptcy Court on January 28, 2013. We are working to resolve differences in cure amounts and certain other discreet issues with counterparties that objected to our motion. The Company continues to review all of its executory contracts and unexpired leases to determine which additional contracts and leases it will reject.The Company expects that additional liabilities subject to compromise will arise due to rejection of executory contracts, including leases, and from the determination of the Bankruptcy Court (or agreement by parties in interest) of allowed claims for contingencies and other disputed amounts. The Company also expects that the assumption of additional executory contracts and unexpired leases will convert certain of the liabilities shown on the consolidated balance sheet as liabilities subject to compromise to liabilities not subject to compromise. Due to the uncertain nature of many of the potential claims, the Company cannot project the magnitude of such claims with certainty.On October 18, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order establishing December 14, 2012 (the General Bar Date) as the bar date for potential creditors, other than governmental units, to file claims. For governmental units to file claims, the bar date was established as January 21, 2013 (the Governmental Bar Date). The bar date is the date by which certain claims against the Company must be filed if the claimants wish to receive any distribution in the bankruptcy cases. Proof of claim forms received after the bar date are typically not eligible for consideration of recovery as part of the Company’s bankruptcy cases. All known potential creditors were notified of the bar date and the requirement to file a claim with the Bankruptcy Court. Patriot also published notices in various publications that are available to the public. Differences between liability amounts estimated by the Company and claims filed by creditors are being investigated and, if necessary, the Bankruptcy Court will make a final determination of the allowable claim. The determination of how liabilities will ultimately be treated cannot be made until the Bankruptcy Court approves a plan of reorganization. Accordingly, the ultimate amount or treatment of such liabilities is not determinable at this time.In order to successfully exit Chapter 11, we will need to propose and obtain confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court of a plan of reorganization that satisfies the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization, among other things, would resolve our pre-petition obligations, set forth the revised capital structure of the newly reorganized entity and provide for corporate governance subsequent to emerging from bankruptcy.We had the exclusive right for 120 days after the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions to file a plan of reorganization. On November 15, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order extending this exclusivity period to May 5, 2013. We may file one or more motions to request extensions of this exclusivity period, which are routinely granted up to 18 months in bankruptcy cases of this size and complexity. If our exclusivity period lapses, any party-in-interest would be able to file a plan of reorganization. In addition to being voted on by requisite holders of impaired claims and equity interests, a plan of reorganization must satisfy certain requirements of the Bankruptcy Code and must be approved, or confirmed, by the Bankruptcy Court in order to become effective. Our timing for filing a plan of reorganization will depend on the timing and outcome of numerous other ongoing matters in the Chapter 11 proceedings.Under the priority rankings established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless creditors agree otherwise, pre-petition liabilities and post-petition liabilities must be satisfied in full before stockholders are entitled to receive any distribution or retain any property under a plan of reorganization. The ultimate recovery to creditors and/or stockholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation of a plan of reorganization. No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be ascribed to each of these constituencies or what types or amounts of distributions, if any, they would receive. A plan of reorganization could result in holders of certain liabilities and/or securities, including common stock, receiving no distribution on account of their interests and cancellation of their holdings. Because of such possibilities, there is significant uncertainty regarding the value of our liabilities and securities, including our common stock. At this time, there is no assurance we will be able to restructure as a going concern or successfully propose or implement a plan of reorganization.10Going Concern MattersPatriot’s consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, although the Bankruptcy Case and weak industry conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or to the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, market conditions and our ability to improve profitability, to meet the financial covenants of the DIP Facilities or obtain appropriate waivers, to obtain financing to replace the DIP Facilities upon emergence and to restructure our obligations in a manner that allows us to obtain confirmation of a plan of reorganization by the Bankruptcy Court. In order to improve profitability, we are taking actions to further reduce operating expenses and align our production to meet market demand. As a result of the Bankruptcy Case, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. While operating as debtors-in-possession pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, we may sell or otherwise dispose of or liquidate assets or settle liabilities, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court or as otherwise permitted in the ordinary course of business (and subject to restrictions contained in the DIP Facilities), for amounts other than those reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Further, any plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities reported in the historical consolidated financial statements.Financial Reporting ConsiderationsFor periods subsequent to filing the Chapter 11 Petitions, we have applied the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 852, “Reorganizations” (ASC 852), in preparing the consolidated financial statements. ASC 852 requires that the financial statements distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Accordingly, certain revenues, expenses, realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred in the bankruptcy proceedings have been recorded in “Reorganization items, net” on the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, pre-petition obligations that may be impacted by the bankruptcy reorganization process have been classified on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012 in “Liabilities subject to compromise.” These liabilities are reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts.Reorganization Items and Other Bankruptcy Related CostsASC 852 requires separate disclosure of reorganization items. The Company’s reorganization items for the year ended December 31, 2012 consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2012 (Dollars in thousands)Provision for rejected executory contracts and leases$82,213Professional fees35,506Losses from adjusting debt from carrying value to amount of allowed claim27,021Accounts payable settlement gains(8,876)Reorganization items, net$135,864Professional fees are directly related to the reorganization and include fees associated with advisors to the Company, the Creditors’ Committee and certain secured creditors. Net cash paid for reorganization items for the year ended December 31, 2012 totaled $23.3 million, all of which related to professional fees.Debt issuance costs of $42.5 million were incurred and paid in connection with the DIP Financing. These amounts were expensed and separately disclosed in the 2012 consolidated statement of operations.Liabilities Subject to CompromiseLiabilities subject to compromise represent pre-petition unsecured obligations that will be settled under a plan of reorganization. Generally, actions to enforce or otherwise effect payment of pre-petition liabilities are stayed. Pre-petition liabilities subject to compromise are reported at the amounts expected to be allowed, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. These liabilities represent the amounts expected to be allowed on known or potential claims to be resolved through the Chapter 11 process, and remain subject to future adjustments arising from negotiated settlements, actions of 11the Bankruptcy Court, rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases, the determination as to the value of collateral securing the claims, proofs of claim, or other events. Liabilities subject to compromise also include certain items that may be assumed under the plan of reorganization, and as such, may be subsequently reclassified to liabilities not subject to compromise.The Bankruptcy Court approved payment of certain pre-petition obligations, including employee wages, salaries and benefits, and the payment of vendors and other providers in the ordinary course for goods and services received after the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions and other business related payments necessary to maintain the operations of the Company’s business. Obligations associated with these matters are not classified as liabilities subject to compromise.With the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, the Company has rejected certain pre-petition executory contracts and unexpired leases with respect to the Company’s operations and may reject additional contracts or unexpired leases in the future. Damages resulting from rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases are generally treated as general unsecured claims and are classified as liabilities subject to compromise. Holders of pre-petition claims were required to file proofs of claims by the General Bar Date or the Governmental Bar Date, as applicable. Differences between liability amounts estimated by the Company and claims filed by creditors are being investigated and, if necessary, the Bankruptcy Court will make a final determination of the allowable claim. The determination of how liabilities will ultimately be treated cannot be made until the Bankruptcy Court approves a plan of reorganization. Accordingly, the ultimate amount or treatment of such liabilities is not determinable at this time.Liabilities subject to compromise consisted of the following: December 31, 2012 (Dollars in thousands)Postretirement benefit obligations, excluding Coal Act$1,517,284Unsecured debt458,500Interest payable4,838Rejected executory contracts and leases151,449Trade payables78,086Other accruals52,150Liabilities subject to compromise$2,262,307Other accruals primarily include liabilities subject to compromise related to accrued royalty payments, litigation reserves, employee claims and other operating accruals.Mining OperationsOur mining operations and coal reserves are as follows:•Appalachia. As of December 31, 2012, we had eight active mining complexes located in Boone, Lincoln, Logan, Kanawha, and Raleigh counties in southern West Virginia. In northern West Virginia, we have one mining complex located in Monongalia County. During 2012, we closed one mining complex in southern West Virginia and converted certain contractor-operated mines to company-operated mines. Also during 2012, we reduced production at certain thermal and metallurgical coal mines in response to decreased market demand. In Appalachia, we sold 18.5 million tons of coal in the year ended December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, we controlled approximately 1.2 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves in Appalachia, of which 492 million tons were assigned to current operations.•Illinois Basin. As of December 31, 2012, we had two active mining complexes located in Union and Henderson counties in western Kentucky. During 2012, we closed one Illinois Basin mining complex. In the Illinois Basin, we sold 6.4 million tons of coal in the year ended December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, we controlled 658 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in the Illinois Basin, of which 119 million tons were assigned to current operations.12The following table provides the location and summary information of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2012.Location Complex Mine(s) MiningMethod(1) Met/Thermal 2012 TonsSold(2)Appalachia Big Mountain(3) Big Mountain No. 16, Contractor CM Thermal 106 Corridor G Job 21, Hill Fork(4) DL, TS Thermal 2,837 Kanawha Eagle(5) Peerless, Coalburg No. 1, Coalburg No. 2, Eagle CM Met/Thermal 697 Logan County Guyan TS Thermal 2,198 Midland Trail Blue Creek No. 1, Campbell’s Creek No. 7(6), Contractor CM Thermal 1,589 Paint Creek Samples, Winchester TS, HW, CM Met/Thermal 1,794 Panther Panther LW, CM Met 2,194 Rocklick Black Oak, Gateway Eagle, Farley Eagle CM Met 1,053 Wells Campbell’s Creek No. 10, Black Stallion, Workman Branch(7) CM Met 1,538 Federal Federal No. 2 LW, CM Thermal 4,036 Purchased coal N/A N/A N/A 472 Subtotal 18,514 Illinois Basin Bluegrass(8) Patriot, Freedom TS, CM Thermal 1,539 Dodge Hill Dodge Hill No. 1 CM Thermal 879 Highland Highland No. 9 CM Thermal 3,967 Subtotal 6,385 Total 24,899(1) LW = Longwall, CM = Continuous Miner, TS = Truck-and-Shovel, DL = Dragline, HW = Highwall(2) Tons sold, presented in thousands, for each complex approximated actual annual production in 2012, subject to stockpile variations.(3) The Big Mountain complex was closed in February 2012.(4) The Hill Fork mine was idled in April 2012.(5) The Coalburg No. 1, Coalburg No. 2 and Eagle mines were closed in the first half of 2012.(6) The Campbell’s Creek No. 7 mine was closed in February 2012.(7) The Workman Branch mine was idled in September 2012.(8) The Freedom mine was closed in June 2012 and the Patriot surface mine was closed in December 2012.13Appalachian Mining OperationsAs of December 31, 2012, our Appalachian Mining Operations included nine active mining complexes in West Virginia.AppalachiaCorridor GThe Corridor G mining complex consists of two company-operated surface mines, Job 21 and Hill Fork, located in southern West Virginia. Coal is sourced from the Kittanning, Stockton and Coalburg seams. Corridor G utilizes dragline and truck-and-shovel/loader mining. Coal produced at Job 21 is transferred by belt to the on-site preparation plant and loadout facility. After processing, the coal is transported to customers by CSX rail. We idled the Hill Fork mine in the second quarter of 2012. Coal produced at the Corridor G mining complex is sold on the thermal market. Certain employees at the Corridor G mining complex are represented by the UMWA.Kanawha EagleThe Kanawha Eagle mining complex is located in southern West Virginia and is currently sourced by one underground mine, Peerless, using continuous mining methods. The Peerless mine was opened in early 2012 and is a company-operated mine. In the first half of 2012, we closed three mines at our Kanawha Eagle mining complex. Processed coal can be sold either on the metallurgical or thermal markets and is transported via CSX rail directly to the customer or trucked to a loading facility on the Kanawha River where the coal can be loaded on barges or Norfolk Southern rail. Coal is produced from the Peerless seam. The employees at the Kanawha Eagle complex are not represented by a union.Logan CountyThe Logan County mining complex consists of one company-operated surface mine, Guyan, located in southern West Virginia. Coal from this complex is sold on the thermal market. The Guyan mine utilizes the truck-and-shovel/loader mining method. Coal produced at this complex is transferred by truck to its on-site preparation plant and loadout facility. Coal is principally transported from the loadout facility to customers by CSX rail. Coal at Logan County is sourced from the Kittanning, Stockton and Coalburg seams. Certain employees at the Logan County complex are represented by the UMWA.Midland TrailThe Midland Trail mining complex is located in southern West Virginia and consists of two underground mines, one company-operated, Blue Creek No. 1, and one contractor-operated. Coal at the Midland Trail mining complex is produced from the Stockton seam. The complex utilizes continuous mining methods. Coal produced at the Midland Trail complex is sold on the thermal market and is loaded onto trucks for transportation to a loading facility on the Kanawha River where the coal can be loaded on barges or Norfolk Southern rail. The employees at the company-operated mine are not represented 14by a union. In 2012, the Campbell’s Creek and Blue Creek mining operations were combined into the Midland Trail complex, and the Campbell’s Creek mines were closed in the first half of 2012.Paint CreekThe Paint Creek mining complex consists of one surface mine and one underground mine located in southern West Virginia. Both mines are company-operated. The surface mine, Samples, utilizes truck-and-shovel/loader and highwall mining methods, while the underground mine, Winchester, utilizes the continuous mining method. Coal from Samples is sourced from the 5-Block, Stockton and Coalburg seams. The Winchester mine operates in the Hernshaw seam. After processing, coal is transported from the on-site preparation plant and loadout facility to customers by CSX rail. Coal can also be trucked approximately 14 miles to the Kanawha River where the coal can be loaded on barges or Norfolk Southern rail. Coal from this complex is sold on both the metallurgical and thermal markets. The employees at the Paint Creek complex are not represented by a union.PantherThe Panther mining complex consists of one company-operated underground mine, Panther, located in southern West Virginia. Coal is produced utilizing the longwall mining and continuous mining methods. All coal is processed at an on-site preparation plant and then transported via truck to a CSX loading facility or to a facility on the Kanawha River where the coal can be loaded on barges or Norfolk Southern rail. Coal produced at the Panther complex is sold into the metallurgical market; however, thermal coal can also be processed and sold at this operation. Coal at the Panther mining complex is produced from the Eagle seam. The employees at the Panther complex are not represented by a union.RocklickThe Rocklick mining complex is located in southern West Virginia and is sourced by three company-operated underground mines, Black Oak, Gateway Eagle, and Farley Eagle. In 2012, we reduced metallurgical coal production at our Rocklick mining complex in response to further weakened demand. Coal at the Rocklick mining complex is produced utilizing continuous mining methods. Rocklick has the capability to transport coal on both the CSX and the Norfolk Southern railroads. Metallurgical coal at the Black Oak mine is produced from the No. 2 Gas seam. The Gateway Eagle mine opened in 2011 and produces metallurgical coal from the Eagle seam. The Farley Eagle mine produces metallurgical coal from the Eagle seam. Thermal coal can also be processed and sold at this operation. Certain employees at the Rocklick mining complex are represented by the UMWA.WellsThe Wells mining complex is located in southern West Virginia and is sourced by two company-operated underground mines, Black Stallion and Campbell’s Creek No. 10. In 2012, we reduced metallurgical coal production at our Wells mining complex in response to further weakened demand. Coal is produced utilizing continuous mining methods. Coal currently produced at the Wells mining complex is sold on the metallurgical market and is transported to customers via CSX rail. Thermal coal can also be processed and sold at this operation. Coal is sourced from the Eagle and No. 2 Gas seams. Certain employees at the company-operated facilities of the Wells mining complex are represented by the UMWA.FederalThe Federal mining complex is located in northern West Virginia and is sourced by one company-operated underground mine, Federal No. 2, utilizing longwall and continuous mining methods. All coal produced at Federal is sold on the thermal market and is transported to customers via the CSX and Norfolk Southern railroads or via barges on the Ohio River. Coal is produced from the Pittsburgh seam. Certain employees at the Federal mining complex are represented by the UMWA.Big MountainIn February 2012, we closed our Big Mountain mining complex located in southern West Virginia. This complex was sourced by one company-operated underground mine, Big Mountain No. 16, and one contractor-operated underground mine located in southern West Virginia.15Illinois Basin Mining OperationsAs of December 31, 2012, our Illinois Basin Mining Operations included two active mining complexes in western Kentucky.Illinois BasinDodge HillThe Dodge Hill mining complex is located in western Kentucky and is sourced by one company-operated underground mine, Dodge Hill No. 1, utilizing continuous mining methods. All coal is sold on the thermal market and transported via truck to a barge loading facility on the Ohio River. Coal at the Dodge Hill mining complex is produced from the Kentucky No. 6 seam. The employees at the Dodge Hill mining complex are not represented by a union.HighlandThe Highland mining complex is located in western Kentucky and is sourced by one company-operated underground mine, Highland No. 9, utilizing continuous mining methods. All coal is sold on the thermal market and is transported via barges loaded on the Ohio River. Coal is produced from the Kentucky No. 9 seam. Certain employees at the Highland complex are represented by the UMWA.BluegrassDuring 2012, we closed our Bluegrass mining complex located in western Kentucky. This complex was sourced by two company-operated mines, Freedom, an underground mine, and Patriot, a surface mine. Coal was produced from the Kentucky No. 9 seam. Coal at Freedom was produced utilizing continuous mining methods, while coal at Patriot was produced utilizing the truck-and-shovel/loader mining method. All coal was sold on the thermal market and was transported via truck or via barge loaded on the Green River. The Freedom mine was idled in the second quarter of 2012 and the Patriot mine and preparation plant were closed in December 2012. The employees at the Bluegrass mining complex were not represented by a union.16Customers and BacklogIn 2012, our coal was sold to 54 electricity generating, industrial, steel producing and coke producing plants in 9 countries, including the U.S., which is where we have our primary customer base. Additionally, 32% of our revenue in 2012 was derived from sales to third-party brokers and traders who ultimately sold the coal as exports to these same types of customers.As of December 31, 2012, we had a sales backlog of 22.4 million tons of coal, including backlog subject to price reopener and/or extension provisions. Our coal supply agreements have remaining terms of up to 3 years and an average volume-weighted remaining term of approximately 1.4 years. Commitments as of December 31, 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 andLater TotalTons (in millions) 16.5 3.9 2.0 — 22.4The 2013 commitments represent approximately 70-75% of our currently estimated production for 2013.In 2012, approximately 65% of our coal sales were under long-term (greater than one year) agreements. We expect to continue selling a significant portion of our coal under long-term coal supply agreements. Our approach is to selectively renew or enter into new coal supply agreements when we can do so at prices we believe are favorable.Typically, customers enter into coal supply agreements to secure reliable sources of coal at predictable prices, while we seek stable sources of revenue to support the investments required to open, expand and maintain or improve productivity at the mines needed to supply these agreements. The terms and conditions of coal supply agreements result from competitive bidding and extensive negotiations with customers. Consequently, the terms and conditions of these contracts vary significantly in many respects, including price adjustment features, price reopener terms, coal quality requirements, quantity parameters, permitted sources of supply, treatment of environmental constraints, extension options, force majeure, termination and assignment provisions.Each coal supply agreement sets a base price. Some agreements provide for a predetermined adjustment to the base price at times specified in the agreement. Base prices may be adjusted quarterly, annually or at other periodic intervals for changes in production costs and/or changes due to inflation. The inflation adjustments are measured by public indices, the most common of which is the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product as published by the U.S. Department of Commerce. In most cases, the components of the base price represented by taxes, fees and royalties which are based on a percentage of the selling price are also adjusted for any changes in the base price and passed through to the customer.Most long-term coal supply agreements also contain provisions to adjust the base price due to new laws or changes in the language, interpretation or application of existing laws that increase our cost of performance under such agreements. Buyers often negotiate similar clauses covering changes in environmental laws. In these instances, we often negotiate the right to supply coal that complies with a new environmental requirement to avoid contract termination.Price reopener provisions are present in some of our long-term coal supply agreements. These provisions may allow either party to commence a renegotiation of the contract price at various intervals. In most of the agreements with price reopener provisions, if the parties do not agree on a new price, the buyer or seller has an option to terminate the contract. Under some agreements with price reopener provisions, we have the right to match the pricing offered to our customers by other suppliers.Quality and volumes for the coal are stipulated in coal supply agreements, and in some limited instances, buyers have the option to vary annual or monthly volumes. Variations to the quality of coal may lead to adjustments in the contract price. Most coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within certain ranges for specific coal characteristics such as heat content (Btu), sulfur and ash content, grindability, ash fusion temperature and metallurgical characteristics. Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, suspension or cancellation of shipments or termination of the contract. Coal supply agreements typically stipulate procedures for sampling, analysis and weighing. In most of our agreements, we have a right of substitution, allowing us to provide coal from different mines, including third parties, as long as the replacement coal meets the contracted quality specifications and is sold at the same delivered price.In most cases, the provisions of coal supply agreements set out mechanisms for temporary reductions or delays in coal volumes in the case of a force majeure event, including strikes, adverse mining conditions, permitting or serious 17transportation problems that affect the seller or unanticipated plant outages that may affect the buyer. Most force majeure provisions stipulate that this tonnage can be made up by either mutual agreement or at the option of the nonclaiming party.Coal supply agreements typically contain termination clauses if either party fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement, although most termination provisions provide the opportunity to cure defaults.Sales and MarketingWe sell coal produced by our operations and by third-party producers. Our sales and marketing group includes personnel dedicated to performing sales functions, transportation, distribution, market research, contract management, and credit/risk management activities.TransportationCoal consumed domestically is typically sold at the mine and transportation costs are borne by the buyer. At most Appalachian mine complexes, we load coal from the preparation plant directly onto railcars. At certain locations, we utilize truck, conveyor belt and rail to transport coal from our mines to docks for transportation to customers via barges. Export coal is usually sold at the loading port, with buyers paying ocean freight. For export coal, we usually pay shipping costs from the mine to the port, transloading fees at the port and any applicable vessel demurrage costs associated with delayed loadings.Of our 24.9 million tons sold in 2012, approximately 58% was shipped by rail, 36% by barge, 4% by ocean-going vessel and 2% by truck. Our transportation staff manages the loading of coal via these transportation modes.Suppliers and ContractorsThe main types of goods we purchase are mining equipment and replacement parts, steel-related (including roof control) products, belting products, lubricants, fuel, explosives and tires. We have many long, well-established relationships with our key suppliers. Although we do not believe that we are dependent on any of our individual suppliers other than for purchases of certain underground mining equipment and steel roof bolts, there are a limited number of suppliers in the coal mining industry. Purchases of certain underground mining equipment and steel roof bolts are concentrated with one principal supplier. The supplier base providing mining materials has been relatively consistent in recent years.We contract with third-party producers to mine certain of our owned or leased coal reserves on a rate per ton basis. Third-party contractors accounted for approximately 10% of our total sales volume for the year ended December 31, 2012.CompetitionThe U.S. coal industry is highly competitive, both regionally and nationally. Coal production in Appalachia and the Illinois Basin totaled approximately 418.5 million tons in 2012, with the largest five producers (Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., CONSOL Energy Inc., Alliance Resource Partners, L.P., Peabody and Patriot) accounting for 48% of production. In addition to competition within the eastern U.S. region, coal is transported into the region from the western U.S. and international producers for purchase by utility customers.A number of factors beyond our control affect the markets in which we sell our coal. Coal consumption patterns are affected primarily by the demand for electricity and steel, environmental and other governmental regulations, and technological developments. Continued demand for our coal and the prices obtained by us depend primarily on the coal consumption patterns of the electricity and steel industries in the U.S. and abroad and the location, availability, quality and price of competing fuels for power such as natural gas, nuclear, fuel oil, and alternative energy sources such as wind and hydroelectric power. The most important factors on which we compete are delivered price (i.e., including transportation costs, which are paid by our customers), coal quality characteristics and reliability of supply.Employees & Labor RelationsRelations with our employees and, where applicable, organized labor, are important to our success. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 4,100 employees. Approximately 40% of our employees were represented by an organized labor union, specifically the UMWA. Our represented employees work at various sites in Appalachia and at the Highland complex in the Illinois Basin. In relation to the bankruptcy process and pursuant to Sections 1113 and 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code, Patriot is seeking to renegotiate the terms of collective bargaining agreements between 18certain Patriot subsidiaries and the UMWA, as well as certain postretirement healthcare benefits. This process, and the resulting outcome, could negatively impact our labor relations.In the third quarter of 2011, certain of our subsidiaries signed new agreements with the UMWA, which were effective July 1, 2011 and generally extend through December 2016. The new agreements are substantially the same as the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement negotiated in mid-2011 between the Bituminous Coal Operators Association and the UMWA. We refer to this as the 2011 National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement (2011 NBCWA).We operate two training centers in Appalachia. Our training centers educate our workforce, particularly our most recent hires, in our rigorous safety standards, the latest mining techniques and equipment, and serve as a center for dissemination of mining best practices across all of our operations. Our training efforts are designed with the intent of attracting new miners, in large part to replace miners expected to retire in the near term, and to develop and retain a productive and safety-oriented workforce.Certain LiabilitiesWe have significant long-term liabilities for asset retirement obligations (including reclamation and selenium water treatment), retiree healthcare and work-related injuries and illnesses. In addition, labor contracts with the UMWA and certain arrangements with non-union employees include long-term benefits, notably healthcare coverage for retired employees, future retirees and their dependents.Asset Retirement ObligationsOur asset retirement obligations include both reclamation and selenium water treatment obligations. Reclamation obligations primarily represent the present value of future anticipated costs to restore surface land to levels equal to or greater than pre-mining conditions, as required by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). Selenium water treatment obligations primarily represent the fair value of future anticipated costs for water treatment of selenium discharges, as required by current court orders, consent decrees and mining permits.As of December 31, 2012, our asset retirement obligations of $731.6 million included $443.0 million of selenium water treatment obligations and $288.6 million of reclamation obligations ($130.4 million of which are related to locations that are closed or inactive). Asset retirement obligation expense (which includes liability accretion and asset amortization) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $354.6 million, $105.2 million and $112.7 million, respectively.Our selenium water treatment obligation is primarily associated with mining properties acquired in connection with the Magnum acquisition in July 2008. Selenium is a naturally occurring element that is encountered in earthmoving operations. The extent of selenium occurrence varies depending upon site-specific geologic conditions. Selenium is encountered globally in coal mining, phosphate mining and agricultural operations. In coal mining applications, selenium can be discharged to surface water when mine tailings are exposed to rain and other natural elements. Selenium effluent limits are included in permits issued to us and other coal mining companies.We have been involved in various legal proceedings related to compliance with the effluent selenium limits in our mining permits. As a result of these legal proceedings, we are subject to various consent decrees and court orders that generally require us, among other things, to meet certain compliance deadlines related to selenium discharge levels at permitted outfalls. In the past, we have paid fines and penalties with respect to violations of selenium effluent limitations.The asset retirement obligation expense included adjustments to increase the selenium water treatment liability by $258.3 million, $35.0 million and $69.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to modifications to our selenium water treatment plans in order to comply with our mining permits and the above mentioned court orders and consent decrees. See a full description of these lawsuits and outcomes related to our selenium water treatment obligations in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Environmental Claims and Litigation.Retiree Healthcare and Pension Obligations for Active and Retired EmployeesRetiree healthcare obligations primarily represent the estimated cost of providing retiree healthcare benefits to current retirees and active employees who will retire in the future. Provisions for active employees represent the amount recognized to date, based on the employee’s service to date. Additional amounts are accrued periodically so that the total estimated liability is accrued when the employee retires.19Our postretirement benefit obligations were $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Expense for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $134.6 million, $125.0 million and $117.2 million, respectively.In relation to the bankruptcy process and pursuant to Sections 1113 and 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code, Patriot is seeking to renegotiate the terms of collective bargaining agreements between certain Patriot subsidiaries and the UMWA, as well as certain postretirement healthcare benefits. Patriot also intends to terminate certain non-union and salaried healthcare and postemployment plans. As such, we have classified the liabilities associated with these plans as “Liabilities subject to compromise” on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012. The liability related to healthcare coverage under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits Act of 1992 (the Coal Act) is not subject to compromise and is classified as such.In connection with the spin-off, a subsidiary of Peabody assumed certain of our pre-spin-off obligations associated with the Coal Act, the 2007 National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement (2007 NBCWA) and certain postretirement healthcare benefits for salaried employees. At December 31, 2012, the present value of the liability as reported by Peabody was $637.6 million. We continue to administer these benefits. Certain Patriot subsidiaries remain jointly and severally liable for the Coal Act obligations and remain secondarily liable for the 2007 NBCWA obligations and the salaried employee postretirement obligations.In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and a companion bill, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the 2010 Healthcare Legislation), were enacted, impacting our costs to provide healthcare benefits to our eligible active and certain retired employees and workers’ compensation benefits related to occupational disease resulting from coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (black lung disease).Many of the 2010 Healthcare Legislation’s standard changes have taken effect and estimates of the impact of these changes on our postretirement benefit obligation have been incorporated into the actuarial valuation. Beginning in 2018, the 2010 Healthcare Legislation will impose a 40% excise tax on employers to the extent that the value of their healthcare plan coverage exceeds certain dollar thresholds. We anticipate that certain government agencies will provide additional regulations or interpretations concerning the application of this excise tax. Until these regulations or interpretations are published, it is impractical to reasonably estimate the ultimate impact of the excise tax on our future healthcare costs or postretirement benefit obligations. We have incorporated changes to our actuarial assumptions to determine our postretirement benefit obligations utilizing basic assumptions related to pending interpretations. Based on preliminary estimates and basic assumptions regarding the pending interpretations of these regulations, the present value of the excise tax does not have a material impact on our postretirement benefit obligations. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2010 Healthcare Legislation in future periods as additional information and guidance become available.The Coal Act provides for the funding of health benefits for certain UMWA retirees. The Coal Act established the United Mine Workers of America Combined Fund (Combined Fund) into which “signatory operators” and “related persons” are obligated to pay annual premiums for beneficiaries. This multi-employer fund provides healthcare benefits to a closed group of retired former employees who last worked prior to 1976, as well as orphaned beneficiaries of bankrupt companies who were receiving benefits as orphans prior to the 1992 law. No new retirees will be added to this group. The liability is subject to increases or decreases in per capita healthcare costs, offset by the mortality curve in this aging population of beneficiaries. The Coal Act also created a second benefit fund, the 1992 Benefit Plan, for miners who retired between July 21, 1992, and September 30, 1994, and whose former employers are no longer in business. Beneficiaries may continue to be added to this fund as employers default in providing their former employees with retiree medical benefits, but the overall exposure for new beneficiaries into this fund is limited to retirees covered under their employer’s plan who retired prior to October 1, 1994. A third fund, the 1993 Benefit Plan, was established through collective bargaining and provides benefits to qualifying former employees, who retired after September 30, 1994, of certain signatory companies who have gone out of business and have defaulted in providing their former employees with retiree medical benefits. Beneficiaries may continue to be added to this fund as employers go out of business. The collective bargaining agreement with the UMWA, which specifies the payments to be made to the 1993 Benefit Plan, was renegotiated in 2011 and generally extends through 2016.In December 2006, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2006 (2006 Act) was enacted. Under the 2006 Act, the orphan benefits paid to the Combined Fund and the 1992 Benefit Plan will be the responsibility of the federal government on a phased-in basis. The legislation authorizes $490 million per year in general fund revenues to pay for these and other benefits under the bill. In addition, future interest from the federal Abandoned Mine Land (AML) trust fund and previous unused interest from the AML trust fund will be available to offset orphan retiree healthcare 20costs. Under current projections for the health funds, these available resources are sufficient to cover all anticipated costs of orphan retirees. These amounts are in addition to any amounts that may be appropriated by the United States Congress (Congress) at its discretion. The legislation also revises the AML fees paid by coal producers based on coal production, effective in October 2007, with the imposition of such fees currently scheduled to expire in its entirety on September 30, 2021. See additional details about the AML trust fund in Mine Closure Costs below.The 2006 Act specifically amended the federal laws establishing the Combined Fund, the 1992 Benefit Plan and the 1993 Benefit Plan. The 2006 Act provided new and additional funding to all three programs, subject to the limitations described below. The 2006 Act guaranteed full funding of all beneficiaries in the Combined Fund by supplementing the annual transfers of interest earned on the AML trust fund. The 2006 Act further provided federal funding for the annual orphan health costs under the 1992 Benefit Plan on a phased-in basis, reaching 100% in 2011. The coal producers that signed the 1988 labor agreement, including some of our subsidiaries, remain responsible for the costs of their beneficiaries of the 1992 Benefit Plan. The 2006 Act also included the 1993 Benefit Plan as one of the statutory funds and authorized the trustees of the 1993 Benefit Plan to determine the contribution rates through 2010 for pre-2007 beneficiaries. Our subsidiaries that have agreed to the 2011 NBCWA will pay $1.10 per hour worked to the 1993 Benefit Plan in 2013. New inexperienced miners hired after January 1, 2007 cannot receive benefits from the 1993 Benefit Plan unless they are disabled as the result of a mine accident. The 1993 Benefit Plan is now effectively closed to new miners.Under the 2006 Act, these new and additional federal expenditures to the Combined Fund, 1992 Benefit Plan, 1993 Benefit Plan and certain AML payments to the states and Indian tribes are collectively limited by an aggregate annual cap of $490 million as described above. To the extent that (i) the annual funding of the programs exceeds this amount (plus the amount of interest from the AML trust fund paid with respect to the Combined Fund), and (ii) Congress does not allocate additional funds to cover the shortfall, contributing employers and affiliates, including some of our subsidiaries, would be responsible for the additional costs.The actuarially-determined liability for these benefit plans was $39.3 million as of December 31, 2012, $5.0 million of which was a current liability. The actuarially-determined liability for these benefit plans was $40.8 million as of December 31, 2011, $5.4 million of which was a current liability. Expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $2.1 million, $2.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Cash payments to these funds were $5.0 million, $5.4 million and $6.0 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The benefit plans that qualify as multi-employer plans are expensed as payments are made and no liability was recorded other than amounts due and unpaid. Expense related to these funds was $4.0 million, $2.5 million and $10.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Certain of our subsidiaries participate in a defined benefit multi-employer pension fund (the 1974 Plan) that was established as a result of collective bargaining with the UMWA pursuant to the 2007 NBCWA, as periodically negotiated and adjusted based on the 2011 NBCWA. The assets of the 1974 Plan are managed by the UMWA. The plan provides pension and disability pension benefits to qualifying represented employees upon retirement. The 2011 NBCWA requires funding at $5.50 per hour for certain UMWA workers. Our subsidiaries with UMWA-represented employees are required to contribute to the 1974 Plan. The 1974 Plan funding rate could change during the term of the 2011 NBCWA if deemed necessary to guarantee benefit payments. Expense related to this plan was $20.8 million, $24.3 million and $21.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.In relation to the bankruptcy process and pursuant to Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code, Patriot is seeking to renegotiate the terms of collective bargaining agreements between certain Patriot subsidiaries and the UMWA, which may affect our future participation in the 1974 Plan.The 1974 Plan is considered to be in “Seriously Endangered Status” for the plan year beginning in July 2011 (the 2011 Plan Year). That status is the result of the 1974 Plan funded percentages being less than 80% and because the 1974 Plan is projected to have an accumulated deficiency within six years after the 2011 Plan Year. As a result, a funding improvement plan was adopted by the 1974 Plan as of May 25, 2012, which would require increased contributions to the 1974 Plan after a new UMWA collective bargaining agreement is negotiated in 2016. Under the funding improvement plan, the hourly contribution rate would increase in stages from a minimum of $12.50 in 2017 to a maximum potential rate of $26.50 as early as 2022.New inexperienced miners hired after January 1, 2012 will not participate in the 1974 Plan. Instead, for each hour worked, the Company contributes $1.00 into the UMWA Cash Deferral Plan on the employee’s behalf, increasing to $1.50 on January 1, 2014. Effective January 1, 2012, employers also pay $1.50 per hour to a new Retiree Bonus Account Trust (Trust) for the term of the 2011 NBCWA. This Trust will make a payment to pensioners in November of 2014, 2015 and 212016 in the amount of $580 for most retirees and $455 for disabled retirees. If Trust funding is not sufficient to make these annual bonus payments, employers will pay the difference directly to their retirees.Effective January 1, 2012, employers also make an additional supplemental pension contribution of $1.00 per hour worked into the UMWA Cash Deferred Savings Plan for each active miner with at least 20 years of credited service under the 1974 Plan, increasing to $1.50 per hour on January 1, 2014. Effective January 1, 2012, any participant in the 1974 Plan may make an irrevocable election to opt out of the 1974 Plan. Such employee will cease to accrue any further service or benefits under the 1974 Plan. Effective with the election, employers contribute $1.00 per hour worked to the UMWA Cash Deferred Plan on the employee’s behalf as a Supplemental Pension Contribution, increasing to $1.50 on January 1, 2014.Workers’ Compensation ObligationsThese liabilities represent the estimates for compensable, work-related injuries (traumatic claims) and occupational disease, principally black lung disease, and are based primarily on actuarial valuations. The Federal Black Lung Benefits Act requires employers to pay black lung awards to former employees who filed successful claims after June 1973. The 2010 Healthcare Legislation amended previous legislation related to black lung disease, providing automatic extension of awarded lifetime benefits to surviving spouses and providing changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims. These liabilities were $279.1 million and $258.3 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, of which $24.4 million and $26.7 million were current liabilities, respectively. Expense for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $35.1 million, $39.8 million and $38.2 million, respectively.Regulatory MattersFederal and state authorities regulate the U.S. coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety, permitting and licensing requirements, the protection of the environment, plants and wildlife, the reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining has been completed, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on surface and groundwater quality and availability. In addition, the industry is affected by significant legislation mandating certain benefits for current and retired coal miners. We have in the past, and will in the future, be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations.Future legislation and regulations are expected to become increasingly restrictive, and there may be more focus on the enforcement of existing and future laws and regulations. Depending on the development of future laws and regulations, we may experience substantial increases in equipment and operating costs and may experience delays, interruptions or termination of operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines or penalties, the acceleration of cleanup and site restoration costs, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations and the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations.Black LungIn the U.S., under the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981, each U.S. coal mine operator must pay federal black lung benefits and medical expenses to claimants who are current and former employees and last worked for the operator for at least one year after July 1, 1973. Coal mine operators must also make payments to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to July 1, 1973. Historically, less than 7% of the miners currently seeking federal black lung benefits have been awarded these benefits. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on coal production sold to U.S. customers. The excise tax is $1.10 per ton for underground mines and $0.55 per ton for surface mines, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price.Mine Safety and HealthOur goal is to achieve excellent mine safety and health performance. We measure our progress in this area primarily through the use of accident frequency rates. We believe that it is our responsibility to our employees to provide a superior safety and health environment. We seek to implement this goal by training employees in safe work practices; openly communicating with employees; establishing, following and improving safety standards; involving employees in the establishment of safety standards; and recording, reporting and investigating all accidents, incidents and losses to avoid re-occurrence. We utilize best practices in emergency preparedness, which includes maintaining multiple mine rescue teams. Certain periodic incentive payments for eligible Patriot personnel are tied to our safety record.22Stringent health and safety standards have been in effect since Congress enacted the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the 1977 Act) significantly expanded the enforcement of safety and health standards and imposed safety and health standards on all aspects of mining operations. In 1978, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) was created to carry out the mandates of the 1977 Act.Congress enacted the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (MINER Act) as a result of an increase in fatal accidents. Among the MINER Act’s requirements, each miner must have at least two, one-hour Self Contained Self Rescue (SCSR) devices for use in the event of an emergency (each miner had at least one SCSR device prior to the MINER Act) and we must provide additional caches of SCSR devices in the escape routes leading to the surface. Our evacuation training programs have been expanded to include more comprehensive training with the SCSR devices and frequent escape drills, as well as mine-wide simulated disaster training. The MINER Act also requires installation of two-way communication systems that allow communication between rescue workers and trapped miners following an accident as mine operators must have the ability to locate each miner’s last known position immediately before and after a disaster occurs.MSHA mandated additional requirements for two-way communication and electronic tracking for use in mine emergencies in January 2009. In September 2010, MSHA issued an emergency temporary standard requiring mine operators to increase the incombustible content of combined coal dust, rock dust, and other dust to at least 80 percent in underground areas of bituminous coal mines. This requirement is further increased for mines containing methane gas. Finally, MSHA has proposed several additional regulations, including a proposal to require the use of continuous personal dust monitors and expanded requirements for medical surveillance. Compliance with these regulations continues to result in additional expense.In the aftermath of the April 5, 2010 accident at a competitor’s underground mine in Central Appalachia, MSHA continues to make changes in seal design and ventilation system approvals. Through Emergency Temporary Standards, Program Policy Bulletins and discretionary approval criteria issued by the MSHA District Manager, the guidelines governing seals and ventilation evaluation points have reduced the action levels of the various gases while increasing the frequency of withdrawals from the mine. Once withdrawal levels are reached, the resumption of operation is solely at MSHA’s discretion and the criteria for plan approval is based on the MSHA District Manager’s requirements. New regulations and changes in the interpretation, enforcement or application of existing laws and regulations have resulted in higher scrutiny during inspections and lower production.The states in which we operate also have programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement. As a result of industry-wide fatal accidents in recent years, primarily at underground mines, several states, including West Virginia and Kentucky, have adopted new safety and training regulations. In addition, MSHA has issued numerous new policies and regulations addressing, but not limited to: emergency notification and response plans, increased fines for violations and additional training and mine rescue coverage requirements. Collectively, federal and state safety and health regulation in the coal mining industry is perhaps the most comprehensive and pervasive system for protection of employee health and safety affecting any segment of U.S. industry. While these changes have had a significant effect on our operating costs, our U.S. competitors with underground mines are subject to the same degree of regulation.Mining Control and Reclamation RegulationsSMCRA is administered by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) and establishes mining, environmental protection and reclamation standards for all aspects of U.S. surface mining as well as many aspects of underground mining. Mine operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals for mining operations from the OSM. Where state regulatory agencies have adopted federal mining programs under SMCRA, the state becomes the regulatory authority. States in which we have active mining operations have achieved primary control of enforcement through federal authorization. On April 13, 2012, the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) ordered the consolidation of certain functions of the OSM into the Bureau of Land Management, and it is uncertain how this or any future actions will affect the administration of SMCRA.SMCRA permit provisions include requirements for coal prospecting; mine plan development; topsoil removal, storage and replacement; selective handling of overburden materials; mine pit backfilling and grading; protection of the hydrologic balance; subsidence control for underground mines; surface drainage control; mine drainage and mine discharge control and treatment; and revegetation.The mining permit application process in the U.S. is initiated by collecting baseline data to adequately characterize the pre-mining environmental condition of the permit area. We develop mine and reclamation plans by utilizing this 23geologic data and incorporating elements of the environmental data. Our mine and reclamation plans incorporate the provisions of SMCRA, the state programs and the complementary environmental programs that impact coal mining. Also included in the permit application are documents defining ownership and agreements pertaining to coal, minerals, oil and gas, water rights, rights of way and surface land, and documents required of the OSM’s Applicant Violator System, including the mining and compliance history of officers, directors and principal stockholders of the applicant.Once a permit application is prepared and submitted to the regulatory agency, it goes through a completeness and technical review. Public notice of the proposed permit is given for a comment period before a permit can be issued. Some SMCRA mine permit applications take over a year to prepare, depending on the size and complexity of the mine, and often take two years or more to be issued. Regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of the permit issuance and the public has the right to comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including public hearings and through intervention in the courts.SMCRA requires compliance with many other major environmental programs. These programs include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and employee right-to-know provisions. Besides OSM, other federal regulatory agencies are involved in monitoring or permitting specific aspects of mining operations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the lead agency for states with no authorized programs under the Clean Water Act, RCRA and CERCLA. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) regulates activities affecting navigable waters and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms regulates the use of explosive materials and equipment.Mine Closure CostsVarious federal and state laws and regulations, including SMCRA, require us to obtain surety bonds or other forms of financial security to secure payment of certain long-term obligations, including mine closure or reclamation costs, federal and state workers’ compensation costs and other miscellaneous obligations. As of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding surety bonds and total letters of credit of $564.9 million, including: $354.5 million for post-mining reclamation; $132.6 million related to workers’ compensation obligations; $54.4 million for retiree health obligations; and $23.5 million for other obligations (including collateral for surety companies and bank guarantees, road maintenance and performance guarantees). Changes in these laws and regulations could require us to obtain additional surety bonds or other forms of financial assurance.The AML trust fund, which is part of SMCRA, imposes a fee on all coal produced in the U.S. The proceeds are used to rehabilitate land mined and left unreclaimed prior to August 3, 1977 and to pay healthcare benefit costs of orphan beneficiaries of the Combined Fund. Under current law, from October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2021, the fee is $0.28 per ton for surface-mined coal and $0.12 per ton for underground-mined coal.Environmental LawsWe are subject to various federal and state environmental laws and regulations that impose significant requirements on our operations. The cost of complying with current and future environmental laws and regulations and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, particularly relating to air emissions, can reduce the demand for coal. Significant public opposition has been raised with respect to the proposed construction of certain new coal-fueled electricity generating plants and certain new export transloading facilities due to the potential air emissions that would result both domestically and globally. Such opposition could also reduce the demand for coal.Numerous federal, state and local governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. When we apply for these permits or approvals, we may be required to prepare and present to governmental authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that the proposed exploration for, or production or processing of, coal may have on the environment. Compliance with these requirements can be costly and time-consuming and can delay exploration or production operations. A failure to obtain or comply with permits could result in significant fines and penalties and could adversely affect the issuance of other permits for which we may apply.Certain key environmental issues, laws and regulations facing us are described further below.Clean Water ActThe federal Clean Water Act and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect coal mining operations by restricting the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill materials, into waters of the U.S. The Clean Water Act 24provisions and associated state and federal regulations are complex and subject to amendments, legal challenges and changes in implementation. As a result of several court decisions and regulatory actions, permitting requirements have increased and could continue to increase the cost and time we expend on compliance with water pollution regulations.For example, in January 2011, the EPA took the unprecedented step of rescinding a federal Clean Water Act permit held by another coal mining company for a surface mine in Appalachia. In explaining its position, the EPA cited significant and irreversible damage to wildlife and fishery resources and severe degradation of water quality caused by mining pollution. This was the first time that the EPA has canceled a federal water permit after it was issued. While our operations were not directly impacted and a federal district court has since reinstated the rescinded permit, this could be an indication that surface mining water permits could be subject to more substantial review in the future.These and other regulatory requirements, which have the potential to change due to legal challenges, legislative actions and other developments, increase the cost of, or could restrict or even prohibit, certain current or future mining operations. Our operations may not be able to remain in full compliance with all obligations and permit requirements under the Clean Water Act or corresponding state or local laws, and as a result we have, at times, been subject to compliance orders and third-party litigation seeking fines or penalties or changes to our operations. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings – Environmental Claims and Litigation for discussion of selenium-related matters.Clean Water Act requirements that may affect our operations include the following:Section 404Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires mining companies to obtain ACOE permits to place material in streams for the purpose of creating slurry ponds, water impoundments, refuse areas, valley fills or other mining activities. As is the case with other coal mining companies operating in Appalachia, our construction and mining activities, including our surface mining operations, frequently require Section 404 permits. The issuance of Section 404 permits for surface mining operations has been the subject of many court cases and increased regulatory oversight, which has resulted in permitting delays and increased permitting and operating costs at surface mining operations. As such, Patriot has been evaluating its utilization of what is termed as large-scale surface mining operations on a long-term strategic basis. In late 2012, Patriot agreed in a litigation settlement and consent modification with various non-governmental environmental organizations to impose interim caps on surface mining coal production beginning in 2014 and leading to a permanent cap beginning in 2018; to retire its Paint Creek surface mine dragline in 2013 and its Hobet surface mine dragline in 2015; and to refrain from certain new large-scale surface mining operations. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Environmental Claims and Litigation - December 2012 Settlement and Consent Modification, for a discussion of this litigation settlement and consent modification.As an example of the increased regulatory oversight, on June 17, 2010, the ACOE announced that it would suspend the use of the nationwide (or “general”) permit for the construction of valley fills and refuse impoundments under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, commonly described as Nationwide Permit 21 (NWP 21), by surface coal operations in West Virginia and other Appalachian states. NWP 21 was reinstated on March 19, 2012, but with significant modifications prohibiting the use of NWP 21 to authorize valley fills. Individual permits are required for surface coal mining projects that use valley fills. We have converted any pending permit applications that were submitted under NWP 21 to individual permit applications. However, individual permits require a public notice and review period, take longer to process and are more costly to obtain.In September 2009, the EPA announced that proposed mining related to certain pending Section 404 permits in Appalachia would require additional enhanced review under the Clean Water Act due to the potential water quality impacts. At that time, seventy-nine permit applications were identified for further, detailed reviews, including six of our permit applications. In January 2010, the permit for our Hobet 45 mine was issued after it had been selected for enhanced review. In October 2011, a federal district court set aside the enhanced review procedure. The EPA and ACOE have reportedly ceased using the enhanced review procedure but, consistent with the Clean Water Act and applicable regulations, continue to collaborate to review Section 404 permit applications.In November 2009, the DOI issued an advance notice of proposed rule making regarding the use of valley fills within a set distance of a stream. The notice set forth a number of potential options the DOI is considering in order to meet the goals of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) among the DOI, the EPA and the ACOE. The DOI is currently developing an environmental impact statement for use in drafting the anticipated stream protection rule. If additional restrictions are ultimately imposed, certain mining activities could become prohibited.25The DOI is also considering establishing, in the context of new permit applications under SMCRA, new standards for restoring mountaintops affected by surface mining, removing the rights of states to revise or grant exemptions to federal restoration standards and developing a federal definition of “material damage” to be used in the context of existing watershed area protections. It is also considering requiring surface mining companies to collect more information on the environmental health of watersheds near their operations, to monitor conditions before and after mining, and to change or close operations if unpermitted damage to the watersheds occurs.Additionally, through the Clean Water Act Section 401 certification program, states have approval authority over federal permits or licenses that might result in a discharge to their waters. States must consider whether the activity will comply with their water quality standards and other applicable requirements in deciding whether or not to certify the activity.National Pollutant Discharge Elimination SystemThe Clean Water Act requires effluent limitations and treatment standards for wastewater discharge through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program. NPDES permits govern the discharge of pollutants into water and require regular monitoring and reporting and performance standards. States are empowered to develop and enforce “in stream” water quality standards. These standards are subject to change and must be approved by the EPA. Discharges must either meet state water quality standards or be authorized through available regulatory processes such as alternate standards or variances. “In stream” standards vary from state to state. Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) regulations establish a process by which states designate stream segments not meeting present water quality standards as impaired. Industrial dischargers, including coal mining operations, may be required to meet new TMDL effluent standards for these stream segments.States must also develop anti-degradation policies to help protect high quality waters and existing quality of other waters. In general, the issuance and renewal of permits to discharge to non-impaired waters are subject to anti-degradation review and other limitations that could cause increases in the costs, time and difficulty associated with obtaining new and complying with existing NPDES permits and could adversely affect our coal production.EPA Water Quality StandardsOn July 21, 2011, the EPA issued comprehensive guidance to clarify the EPA’s roles and expectations in coordinating with its federal and state partners to assure more consistent, effective and timely compliance by Appalachian surface coal mining operations with the provisions of the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and the Environmental Justice Executive Order. This guidance established threshold conductivity levels to be used as a basis for evaluating compliance with narrative water quality standards. Conductivity is a measure that reflects levels of salt, sulfides and other chemical constituents present in water. The EPA has stated that it may be difficult for most surface mining operations to meet these water quality standards. Additionally, the guidance made recommendations with regard to assessing, avoiding and minimizing environmental impacts to water quality, including establishing protective water quality parameters and requiring best management practices and other permit requirements. As a result of the EPA’s guidance, we and other mining companies would have been subject to more stringent permit requirements imposed through our NPDES and Section 404 permits.On July 31, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (the D.C. District Court) struck down the EPA water quality guidance issued on July 21, 2011. However, the EPA has filed a notice of intent to appeal the D.C. District Court ruling and we cannot predict the outcome of such action. Moreover, the West Virginia Environmental Quality Board has called on WVDEP to include similar standards to those in the EPA guidance in any pending coal mining permit.There can be no guarantee that we are or will be able to meet the requirements imposed by our permits. It is unknown what other future changes will be implemented to the permitting review and issuance process or to other aspects of mining operations, but the increased regulatory focus, recent attention in Congress, announced regulatory changes and reviews and any additional future permitting changes could materially and adversely affect all coal mining companies operating in Appalachia, including us. In particular, we could be unable to obtain new permits or maintain existing permits, which could result in the suspension of current operations or prevent the opening of new mines, we could be required to change operations in a manner that could be costly and we could incur fines, penalties and other costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.26Clean Air RegulationsThe Clean Air Act and the corresponding state laws that regulate the emissions of materials into the air affect U.S. coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining and processing operations may occur through Clean Air Act permitting requirements and/or emission control requirements, including with respect to particulate matter and methane. In November 2011, advocates for further regulation of coal mining sued the EPA in an effort to force further restrictions on methane, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxide and other air emissions. The Clean Air Act and equivalent state laws also indirectly affect the coal industry by extensively regulating the air emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and other compounds emitted by our customers that operate coal-fueled electricity generating plants or other regulated combustion sources. Additionally, the EPA has begun regulating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. In recent years Congress has also considered legislation that would require reduced emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury. Existing and new legislation and regulations may lead to some electricity generating customers closing or curtailing operations or switching to other sources of fuel in an attempt to lower levels of regulated emissions.Clean Air Act requirements that may directly affect our customers include the following:Sulfur Dioxide and Nitrogen Oxide EmissionsThe EPA promulgated the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in March 2005. CAIR requires the reduction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from electricity generating plants in 27 eastern states and the District of Columbia. CAIR has been subject to a complex series of legal challenges since its promulgation. In July 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) to replace CAIR.On August 21, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit Court) vacated CSAPR, leaving CAIR in effect pending the issuance of a replacement rule. The EPA petitioned the D.C. Circuit Court for a rehearing in an effort to reinstate CSAPR. The D.C. Circuit Court rejected this petition on January 24, 2013. The EPA is expected to issue a replacement rule to regulate the interstate transport of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. Any such replacement rule would likely impose significant emission reduction requirements on our customers and reduce the demand for thermal coal.In addition, Congress has, in the past, considered legislation to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants. Any of the foregoing legislative or regulatory Clean Air Act initiatives could cause our customers to close or curtail operations, change their coal sources, or reduce their demand for coal.Mercury and Other Air Pollutant EmissionsIn December 2011, the EPA finalized the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for power plants (MATS), which, by early 2015, will impose on power plants emission standards for heavy metals, including mercury, arsenic, chromium and nickel, and acid gases, including hydrogen chloride and hydrogen floride.In February 2011, the EPA issued emission standards for mercury, other metals and organic air toxics from certain boilers and process heaters. In December 2012, the EPA finalized revisions to the emission standards imposing work practice requirements and emission limits that may affect the demand for coal.Congress has in the past also considered legislation to reduce mercury emission from power plants. Existing and future regulations and legislation that reduce emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from power plants and other combustion sources could adversely affect the demand for coal. For example, the EPA has estimated that MATS could cause coal production in Appalachia for use by the electric power sector to decline by 6% in 2015 relative to projected production levels in the absence of MATS.Particulate MatterIn October 2006, the EPA updated the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) applicable to fine and coarse particulate matter. In February 2009, the D.C. Circuit Court remanded to the EPA certain aspects of the fine particulate matter standards. In response, the EPA lowered the annual fine particulate matter standard to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter on December 14, 2012. Existing and possible future restrictions on the emission of fine or coarse particulate matter could result in additional and expensive control requirements for coal-fueled power plants, which could adversely affect the demand for coal. In addition, any such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to develop new mines or require us to modify our existing operations.27OzoneNitrogen oxides, which are a by-product of coal combustion, can lead to the creation of ground-level ozone. In 2008, the EPA lowered the eight-hour ozone standards to 0.075 parts per million. The EPA is expected to review these standards in 2013. Any revisions to these standards may require more stringent emissions controls on sources of nitrogen oxides, including coal-fueled electricity generating plants, which could adversely affect the demand for coal from our mining operations.New Source Review RegulationsPursuant to the EPA’s New Source Review (NSR) program, existing coal-fueled power plants could be required under certain circumstances to install the more stringent air emissions control equipment required of new plants. Our electricity generating customers may be subject to NSR enforcement actions and, if found not to be in compliance, could be required to install additional control equipment at the affected plants or they could decide to close some or all of those plants. The EPA has predicted that its enforcement of the NSR program will, in particular, lead to the closure of aging, coal-fueled power plants. Changes to the NSR program and/or its enforcement may adversely impact demand for coal.Regional HazeOn June 15, 2005, the EPA amended the 1999 regional haze rule, which established planning and emissions reduction timelines for states to use to improve visibility in national parks throughout the U.S. Under the amended rule, certain older power plants may be required to implement best available retrofit technology (BART), which could include the installation of additional controls for nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. The EPA has indicated that states may implement a CAIR trading program for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide as an alternative to requiring source-specific BART for power plants.Acid RainTitle IV of the Clean Air Act regulates sulfur dioxide emissions by coal-fueled power plants with generating capacity greater than 25 megawatts. The affected electricity generators have sought to meet these requirements by, among other compliance methods, switching to lower sulfur fuels, installing pollution control devices, reducing electricity generating levels or purchasing sulfur dioxide emission allowances. Title IV also requires that certain categories of electric generating stations install certain types of nitrogen oxide controls.State LawsSeveral states have recently proposed or adopted legislation or regulations further limiting emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and hazardous air pollutants. Limitations imposed by states on emissions of any of these substances could cause our customers to switch to other fuels to the extent it becomes economically preferable for them to do so.Global Climate ChangeOne by-product of burning coal is carbon dioxide, which has been linked in certain studies as a contributor to climate change. Pursuant to the Clean Air Act, the EPA has begun regulating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, as a result of which certain facilities, including coal-fueled power plants, are subject to permitting and other requirements under the Clean Air Act. We and many of our customers are required to report annual greenhouse gas emissions from certain operations. In addition, the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule (GHG Tailoring Rule) sets forth criteria for determining which facilities are required to obtain permits to construct, modify or operate on account of, and to implement the best available control technology (BACT) for, their greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V operating permit programs. Under the GHG Tailoring Rule, permitting requirements are being phased in through successive steps that expand the scope of covered sources over time. The EPA has issued guidance on what BACT entails for the control of greenhouse gases and individual states must determine what controls are required for facilities within their jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis.On April 13, 2012, the EPA published proposed new source performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from certain new power plants. The proposal anticipates that affected new-build coal fueled plants would generally need to install carbon capture and storage technology, which currently is not economically feasible, or other expensive carbon dioxide emission control technology to meet the proposed standard. In addition to the proposed standards, the EPA may also seek to regulate modifications to existing coal-fueled plants or provide guidelines for states to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. Although it is not yet possible to predict the effect of these or any other 28greenhouse gas regulations, such regulations may cause a reduction in the amount of coal that our customers purchase from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.In addition, legislators have considered the passage of significant new laws to address climate change, including, among others, those that would impose a nationwide cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and require large sources, including coal-fueled power plants, to obtain “emission allowances” to meet that cap, with the ultimate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.In the absence of federal legislation, many states, regions and local authorities have adopted greenhouse gas regulations and initiatives. For example, nine northeastern and mid-Atlantic states participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, pursuant to which they have agreed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector by 2018. In addition, more than half of the states in the U.S. have implemented renewable portfolio standards, which generally mandate that a specified percentage of electricity sales in the state come from renewable energy, and Congress has considered legislation that would impose a similar federal mandate.These and other federal, state and regional climate change rules will likely require additional controls on coal-fueled sources and may even cause some users of coal to close or curtail operations or switch from coal to a lower carbon fuel. In addition, some states, municipalities and individuals have initiated common law nuisance suits against power, coal, oil and gas companies alleging that their operations are contributing to climate change. The plaintiffs in these cases seek various remedies, including punitive and compensatory damages and injunctive relief. If successful, these or similar suits could lead to reductions in or other limitations on the amount of coal our customers could utilize.The permitting of new coal-fueled power plants has also recently been contested by state regulators and environmental organizations based on concerns relating to greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, certain power generating companies may reconsider short-term or long-term plans to build coal-fueled plants or may elect to build capacity using alternative forms of electrical generation.Demand for and use of coal also may be limited by any global treaties which place restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. As part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the U.S. has participated in negotiations regarding greenhouse gas emissions reductions and has committed to non-binding emissions reduction targets. Any treaty or other arrangement ultimately adopted by the U.S. or other countries to implement this commitment or otherwise reduce greenhouse gas emissions may have a material adverse impact on the global demand for coal, which in turn could have an adverse impact on our business.Any of the foregoing current or future laws, regulations or other initiatives to address greenhouse gas emissions could affect coal-fueled power plants in particular and reduce the amount of coal that our customers purchase from us, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations.Hazardous WasteThe RCRA established comprehensive requirements for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. Coal mine wastes, such as overburden and coal cleaning wastes, generally are not considered hazardous waste materials under the RCRA. In May 2010, the EPA released two competing proposals for the regulation of coal combustion by-products (CCB). One approach would regulate the by-products as hazardous or special waste, and the other would classify the by-products as non-hazardous waste. If CCB were classified as special or hazardous waste, regulations may impose restrictions on CCB disposal, provide specifications for storage facilities, require groundwater testing and impose restrictions on storage locations. These regulations, or any other regulations which increase the costs associated with the management or disposal of CCB, could adversely impact our customers’ operating costs and potentially reduce their demand for coal.Toxic Release ReportingUnder the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory process, companies are required to annually report the use, manufacture or processing of listed toxic materials that exceed defined thresholds, including chemicals used by us in equipment maintenance, reclamation and water treatment.Federal and State Superfund StatutesCERCLA and similar state laws impose liability for investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and for damages to natural resources. Under CERCLA or similar state laws, strict, joint and several liability may be imposed on waste generators, site owners or operators and others regardless of fault. Thus, coal mines or other sites that we currently 29own or operate or have previously owned or operated and sites to which we have sent waste material may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws. In the past, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at some sites, but based on current information, we do not believe any liability under CERCLA or similar state laws will be material.Additional InformationWe file annual, quarterly and current reports, and any amendments to those reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Risk Factors.RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in evaluating our company and our common stock. If any of the risks described below actually occur, our business, financial results, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.Risk Factors Relating to our Bankruptcy ProceedingsPatriot, as a stand-alone entity, and substantially all of our subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (collectively with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, the Bankruptcy Court) is hearing the cases, jointly administered under Case No. 12-51502 (the Bankruptcy Case), and we are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy proceedings.For the duration of the Bankruptcy Case, our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include:•our ability to continue as a going concern;•our ability to develop, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Bankruptcy Case, which is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to implement changes to wage and benefit programs and postretirement benefit obligations pursuant to Sections 1113 and 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code to minimize our liabilities upon emergence and to obtain post-bankruptcy financing;•our ability to operate within the restrictions and liquidity limitations of the post-petition credit facilities authorized by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Bankruptcy Case (the DIP Facilities);•our ability to obtain timely Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions filed in the Bankruptcy Case;•the ability of third parties to seek and obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a plan of reorganization, to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee or to convert the Bankruptcy Case to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code;•our ability to comply with and operate under any cash management orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court from time to time;•our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;•our ability to obtain and maintain normal payment and other terms with customers, vendors and service providers;•our ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees;•our ability to attract and retain customers;32•our ability to maintain credit to retain and attract necessary suppliers and service providers; and•our ability to fund and execute our business plan.These risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events or publicity associated with the Bankruptcy Case could adversely affect our relationships with our vendors, employees and customers, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Bankruptcy Case, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 reorganization process may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there is no certainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.Trading in our securities during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Case is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. It is impossible to predict at this time whether our equity or other securities will be canceled or if holders of such equity or other securities will receive any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments.It is unclear at this stage of the Bankruptcy Case if any proposed plan of reorganization would allow for distributions with respect to our equity or other securities. It is likely that our equity securities will be canceled and extinguished upon confirmation of a proposed plan of reorganization by the Bankruptcy Court and the holders thereof would not be entitled to receive, and would not receive or retain, any property or interest in property on account of such equity interests. In the event of cancellation of our equity or other securities, amounts invested by the holders of such securities would not be recoverable and such securities would have no value. Trading prices for our equity or other securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders thereof during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Case. Accordingly, we urge extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in our equity or other securities.Our common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange and is traded only in the over-the-counter market, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity.The shares of our common stock were historically listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) under the symbol “PCX.” In connection with the commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, effective July 10, 2012, the NYSE suspended the trading of our shares and, effective August 6, 2012, the NYSE removed our shares from listing and registration on the NYSE. Our common stock is now trading over-the-counter and is quoted on the OTC Market under the ticker symbol “PCXCQ.” The extent of the public market for our common stock and the continued availability of quotations depends upon such factors as the aggregate market value of the common stock, the interest in maintaining a market in our common stock on the part of securities firms and other factors. The OTC Market is a significantly more limited market than the NYSE, and the quotation of our common stock on the OTC Market may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential shareholders to trade shares of our common stock. This could further depress the trading price of our common stock and could also have a long-term adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any public market for our common stock will exist in the future or that we will be able to relist our common stock on a national securities exchange. In connection with the delisting of our common stock, there may also be other negative implications, including the potential loss of confidence in Patriot by suppliers, customers and employees and the loss of institutional investor interest in our common stock.The DIP Facilities include financial and other covenants that impose substantial restrictions on our financial and business operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance with the requirements of the DIP Facilities or that the lending commitments under the DIP Facilities will not be restricted or terminated by the DIP lenders.The DIP Facilities provide for events of default specific to the Bankruptcy Case, including dismissal of the Bankruptcy Case, conversion to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, the appointment of a trustee, or entry of certain orders. Orders that would be an event of default include: an order reversing, amending, supplementing, staying or vacating the DIP order entered by the Bankruptcy Court; an order denying or terminating our use of cash collateral; an order granting relief from the automatic stay to the holder or holders of any security interest permitting foreclosure on our assets above a threshold amount; or an order authorizing other actions that would have an adverse effect on us. The DIP Facilities contain other events of default customary for debtor-in-possession financings. An event of default under the DIP Facilities would give the DIP lenders the right to terminate their lending commitments, declare all loans, all 33interest thereon and all other obligations under the DIP Facilities due and payable and exercise other remedies available to them under the DIP Facilities.The DIP Facilities provide for customary representations and warranties by us. The DIP Facilities further provide for affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries, including affirmative covenants requiring us to provide financial information, 13-week projections and other information to the DIP lenders, including, upon request, environmental or mining site assessments or audit reports, and negative covenants restricting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, dispose of assets, pay dividends or take certain other actions.The DIP Facilities include financial covenants applicable to Patriot and its subsidiaries, including compliance with requirements relating to minimum consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the DIP Facilities, maximum capital expenditures and minimum liquidity. At December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. Based on continued declines in metallurgical coal demand and prices experienced in the second half of 2012 and the related effect on our current internal financial forecasts, we believe there is a substantial likelihood that we may not comply with the minimum consolidated EBITDA financial covenant beginning in the third quarter of 2013. Our financial forecasts are subject to significant variation due to the volatility in the coal markets, including demand and prices for our products, and uncertainties surrounding our restructuring initiatives, so our compliance with the minimum consolidated EBITDA financial covenant remains subject to market conditions and our ability to improve financial performance. Failure to comply with our financial covenants would be an event of default under the terms of our DIP Facilities. If an event of default occurs, we would need to negotiate an amendment or waiver from the lenders; however, there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain such an amendment or waiver in the future.If, as a result of our breach of the terms thereof, the DIP Facilities are terminated or our access to funding thereunder is restricted or terminated, we may not have sufficient cash availability to meet our operating needs or satisfy our obligations as they become due, in which instance we could be required to seek a sale of Patriot or certain of its material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, or to convert the Bankruptcy Case into a liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.Our liquidity position imposes significant risk to our operations.There can be no assurance that the amounts of cash from operations, together with amounts available under the DIP Facilities, will be sufficient to fund operations. Given the current business environment, our liquidity needs could be significantly higher than we currently anticipate. Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity through 2013 and beyond could depend on our ability to successfully implement an appropriate plan of reorganization, successful operation of our business and appropriate management of operating expenses and capital spending, and our ability to borrow under the DIP Facilities. Our expected liquidity needs are highly sensitive to changes in each of these and other factors. Even if we successfully take any of the actions described above, we may be required to execute asset sales or other capital generating actions over and above our normal business activities and cut back or eliminate other programs that are important to the future success of our business.The DIP Facilities provide for (a) the First Out Revolving Credit Loan in an amount not to exceed $125.0 million, (b) the First Out Term Loan in the amount of $375.0 million, and (c) the Second Out Facility, in respect of pre-petition letters of credit, inclusive of any obligations as to reimbursement, renewal and extension of the same, issued in the aggregate amount of approximately $302.0 million as of July 9, 2012. In the event that cash flows and borrowings under the DIP Facilities are not sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements, we may be required to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that additional financing would be available, or, if available, would be available on acceptable terms. Failure to secure any necessary additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to continue as a going concern.Our liquidity challenges are public information and despite the liquidity provided by our DIP Facilities, our ability to maintain normal credit terms with our suppliers may become impaired. We may be required to pay cash in advance to certain vendors and may experience restrictions on the availability of trade credit, which would further reduce our liquidity. If liquidity problems persist, our suppliers could refuse to provide key products and services in the future. In addition, due to the public perception of our financial condition and results of operations, in particular with regard to uncertainties surrounding our bankruptcy process and reorganization, some customers could be reluctant to enter into long-term agreements with us.34The pursuit of the Bankruptcy Case and related litigation has occupied and will continue to occupy a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management and will impact how our business is conducted, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.A long period of operating under Chapter 11 could adversely affect our business and results of operations. While the Bankruptcy Case continues, our employees will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the Bankruptcy Case. This diversion of attention from other matters may materially adversely affect the conduct of our business, and, as a result, on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the Bankruptcy Case is protracted.The venue transfer from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri may prolong the bankruptcy process.On July 18, 2012 and August 7, 2012, respectively, the UMWA and several surety companies filed motions requesting that the venue for our Chapter 11 filing be transferred to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The U.S. Trustee also filed a motion arguing that the venue should be transferred from the Southern District of New York to another district. On November 27, 2012, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York issued a ruling transferring the bankruptcy cases to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and, on December 19, 2012, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York entered an order formally transferring the bankruptcy cases to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. An effect of the venue transfer may be to increase the amount of time necessary for us to exit bankruptcy, prolonging our exposure to the risks and uncertainties of bankruptcy proceedings as well as increasing our professional fees related to the process of reorganizing.We may experience increased levels of employee attrition.During the pendency of the Bankruptcy Case, our employees will face considerable distraction and uncertainty and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet customer and supplier expectations, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Bankruptcy Case is limited during the Bankruptcy Case by restrictions on implementation of retention programs and the uncertain value of our equity compensation. The failure to retain or attract members of our executive management team and other key personnel could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.If we are not be able to obtain confirmation of our plan of reorganization or if sufficient debtor-in-possession financing is not available, we could be required to seek a sale of the Company or certain of its material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.Our plan of reorganization has not yet been formulated or submitted to the Bankruptcy Court. In order to successfully emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, we must develop and obtain court and creditor approval of our plan of reorganization. This process requires us to meet statutory requirements with respect to adequacy of disclosure with respect to a plan, soliciting and obtaining creditor acceptance of a plan, and fulfilling other statutory conditions for plan confirmation. We may not receive the requisite acceptances to confirm a plan. Even if the requisite acceptances of a plan are received, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm it or there may not be sufficient exit financing available to finance the Company’s emergence from Chapter 11 under a plan. In addition, the DIP Facilities may not be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements or may be restricted or terminated by the lenders under the DIP Facilities for our breach thereof. If any of these events were to occur we could be forced to sell the Company or certain of its material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.We have not made any final determinations with respect to reorganizing our capital structure, and any changes to our capital structure may have a material adverse effect on existing debt and security holders.Any reorganization of our capital structure that we may engage in may include exchanges of new debt or equity securities for our existing debt and equity securities, and such new debt or equity securities may be issued at different interest rates, payment schedules, and maturities than our existing debt and equity securities. We may also modify our existing debt or equity securities to the same effect. Such exchanges or modifications are inherently complex to implement. The success of a reorganization through any such exchanges or modifications will depend on approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the willingness of existing debt and security holders to agree to the exchange or modification, and there can 35be no guarantee of success. If such exchanges or modifications are successful, the existing holders of common stock may find that their holdings no longer have any value, are materially reduced in value or are severely diluted. Also, holders of our debt may find their holdings no longer have any value or are materially reduced in value, or they may be converted to equity and be diluted or receive debt with a principal amount that is less than the outstanding principal amount, longer maturities, and reduced interest rates. There can be no assurance that any new debt or equity securities will maintain their value at the time of issuance. Also, if the existing debt or equity security holders are adversely affected by a reorganization, it may adversely affect Patriot’s ability to issue new debt or equity in the future.The volatility of the financial markets may prevent us from obtaining financing to complete the reorganization.In order to reorganize, we will require access to the financial markets. Financial markets remain fragile and are heavily influenced by volatile government policies and interventions, which may ultimately limit the terms, availability and affordability of financing necessary for us to reorganize.Any plan of reorganization that we may implement will be based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, our plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.Any plan of reorganization that we may implement could affect both our capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of our businesses and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (i) our ability to substantially change our capital structure; (ii) our ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources; (iii) our ability to maintain customers’ confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them; (iv) our ability to retain key employees; and (v) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions of the financial and coal industries, both in the U.S. and in global markets. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of our businesses.In addition, any plan of reorganization will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, EBITDA, capital expenditures, debt service and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. In our case, the forecasts will be even more speculative than normal, because they may involve fundamental changes in the nature of our capital structure. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization we may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us and our subsidiaries or our businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of any plan of reorganization.Operating under Chapter 11 may restrict our ability to pursue our strategic and operational initiatives.Under Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Additionally, the terms of the DIP Facilities limit our ability to undertake certain business initiatives. These limitations include, among other things, our ability to:•sell assets outside the normal course of business;•consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;•grant liens; and•finance our operations, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that might be in our interest.As a result of the Bankruptcy Case, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are subject to uncertainty.While operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, and subject to Bankruptcy Court approval or otherwise as permitted in the normal course of business, we may sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for amounts other than those reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our consolidated historical financial statements, which do 36not currently give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization.As a result of the Bankruptcy Case, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance.Our capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan of reorganization ultimately confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start reporting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair values and our accumulated deficit would be restated to zero. Accordingly, if fresh-start reporting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. In connection with the Bankruptcy Case and the development of a plan of reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations in any given period.Risk Factors Relating to Demand for our ProductsAny change in coal consumption patterns could result in a decrease in the use of our coal by those consumers, which could result in lower prices for our coal, a reduction in our revenues and the value of our coal reserves as well as an adverse impact on our results of operations.Metallurgical coal accounted for approximately 25%, 24% and 22% of our coal sales volume during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Metallurgical coal is sold to domestic steel producers and to steel producers in the global export markets. Industry-wide global export markets are primarily driven by steel production in growing countries such as China and India, as well as Europe, Brazil and the U.S., and are impacted by the availability of metallurgical coal from coal producing countries such as Australia. The majority of our metallurgical coal production is priced annually, and as a result, a decrease in near term metallurgical coal prices could decrease our profitability.The steel industry also relies on electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal processes to make steel. These processes do not use furnace coke, an intermediate product produced from metallurgical coal. Therefore, growth in future steel production may not be directly correlated to increased demand for metallurgical coal. If the demand or pricing for metallurgical coal decreases in the future, the amount of metallurgical coal we sell and prices that we receive for it could decrease, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves.Thermal coal accounted for approximately 75%, 76% and 78% of our coal sales volume during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our sales of thermal coal were to U.S. electric power generators with an increasing percentage sold into the global export market. The amount of coal consumed for U.S. electric power generation is affected primarily by the overall demand for electricity; the location, availability, quality and price of competing fuels for power such as natural gas, nuclear, fuel oil and alternative energy sources such as wind and hydroelectric power; technological developments; limitations on financings for coal-fueled power plants; and governmental regulations, including increasing difficulties in obtaining permits for coal-fueled power plants and more burdensome restrictions in the permits received for such facilities. The increasingly stringent requirements of the Clean Air Act and other laws and regulations, including tax credits that have been or may be provided for alternative energy sources and renewable energy mandates that have been or may be imposed on utilities, may result in more electric power generators shifting away from coal-fueled generation, the closure of existing coal-fueled plants and the building of more non-coal fueled electrical generating sources in the future. Recent developments in natural gas production processes have lowered the cost and increased the supply, resulting in greater use of natural gas for electricity generation. All of the foregoing could reduce demand for our coal, which could reduce our revenues, earnings and the value of our coal reserves.During 2012, coal demand was negatively impacted by low natural gas prices, mild weather and weak international and domestic economies. The demand for metallurgical coal is dependent on the strength of the global economy and, in particular, on steel production in countries such as China and India as well as Europe, Brazil and the U.S. In response to the recent global economic downturn, the demand for steel declined, and as a result, the demand and price for metallurgical coal also declined.Weather patterns can greatly affect electricity generation. Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, cause increased power usage and, therefore, increased generating requirements from all sources. Mild temperatures, on the other hand, result in lower electricity demand. Accordingly, significant changes in weather patterns impact the demand for our coal.37Overall economic activity and the associated demands for power by industrial users can also have significant effects on overall electricity demand. Deterioration in U.S. electric power demand would reduce the demand for our thermal coal.Any decrease in coal prices, whether due to increased use of alternative energy sources, changes in weather patterns, decreases in overall demand or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and likely adversely impact our earnings and the value of our coal reserves. Additionally, if global recessions or general economic downturns result in sustained decreases in the global demand for electricity and steel production, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.Prolonged global recessionary conditions could impact our customers’ ability to perform under our contracts with them and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Because we sell substantially all of our coal to electricity generators and steel producers, our business and results of operations are closely linked to global demand for electricity and steel production. Historically, global demand for basic inputs, including demand for electricity and steel production, has decreased during periods of economic downturn. Prolonged decreases in global demand for electricity and steel production could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If there is a worsening of global and U.S. economic and financial market conditions and additional tightening of global credit markets, as experienced in Greece and certain other European countries, demand for electricity and steel production may suffer.The slowing global economic growth and distressed European financial markets experienced in late 2011 and early 2012 created economic uncertainty, and steel producers and electricity generators responded by decreasing coal purchases. As the demand for coal declines, certain of our customers may request delays in shipments or request deferrals pursuant to existing long-term coal supply agreements. During the first half of 2012, we were approached by certain customers seeking to cancel or delay shipments of coal contracted for delivery under coal supply agreements. In addition, two of our customers defaulted on their contractual obligations to purchase coal from us. We have filed legal actions for damages resulting from these breached contracts. Customer deferrals, if agreed to, could affect the amount of revenue we recognize in a certain period and could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity if we do not receive equivalent value from such customers and we are unable to sell committed coal at the contracted prices under our existing coal supply agreements. To the extent we or a customer do not fully perform under our contracts, our results of operations and operating profit in the reporting period during which such non-performance occurs would be materially and adversely affected.Increased competition both within the coal industry, and outside of it, such as competition from alternative fuel providers, may adversely affect our ability to sell coal, and any excess production capacity in the industry could put downward pressure on coal prices.The coal industry is intensely competitive both within the industry and with respect to alternative fuel sources. The most important factors with which we compete are price, coal quality and characteristics, transportation costs from the mine to the customer and reliability of supply. Our principal competitors include Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., Arch Coal, Inc., CONSOL Energy, Inc., James River Coal Company, Peabody Energy Corporation and Walter Energy, Inc. We also compete directly with all other Central Appalachian coal producers, as well as producers from other basins including Northern and Southern Appalachia, the Illinois Basin, and the Western U.S., and foreign countries, including Australia, Colombia, Venezuela and Indonesia.Depending on the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies of other coal-producing countries, coal from other countries could enjoy cost advantages that we do not have. Several domestic coal-producing regions have lower-cost production than Central Appalachia, including the Illinois Basin and the Powder River Basin. Coal with lower delivered costs shipped east from these regions and from offshore sources can result in increased competition for coal sales in regions historically sourced from Appalachian producers.We could experience decreased profitability if future coal production is consistently greater than coal demand. Lower demand for coal in recent years has resulted in the idling of coal production capacity, much of which, however, could be put back into production should demand increase. Any resulting overcapacity from existing or new competitors could reduce coal prices and, therefore, our revenue and profitability.We also face competition from renewable energy providers, like biomass, wind and solar, and other alternative fuel sources, like natural gas and nuclear energy. Should renewable energy sources become more competitively priced, which may be more likely to occur given the federal tax incentives for alternative fuel sources that are already in place and that 38may be expanded in the future, or sought after as an energy substitute for fossil fuels, the demand for such fuels may adversely impact the demand for coal. Existing fuel sources also compete directly with coal. For example, weak natural gas prices have caused certain utilities to increase electricity generation from their natural gas-fueled plants instead of generation from their coal-fueled plants.New developments in the regulation of greenhouse gas and other air emissions, coal ash and other environmental matters could materially adversely affect our customers’ demand for coal and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.One by-product of burning coal is carbon dioxide, which has been linked in certain studies as a contributor to climate change. Legislators have considered the passage of significant new laws to address climate change, including, among others, those that would impose a nationwide cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and require large sources, including coal-fueled power plants, to obtain “emission allowances” to meet that cap, with the ultimate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA and other regulators are using existing laws, including the federal Clean Air Act, to impose obligations, including emission limits and technology-based requirements, on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. For example, in April 2012 the EPA proposed new source performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from certain new power plants. The proposal anticipates that affected new-build, coal-fueled plants generally would need to install carbon capture and storage technologies, which currently is not economically feasible, or other expensive control technology to meet the proposed standard. Although it is not yet possible to predict the effect of the GHG Tailoring Rule, greenhouse gas reporting requirements or the proposed or any future greenhouse gas performance standards or emission guidelines, such regulations may cause a reduction in the amount of coal that our customers purchase from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.In addition, more than half of the states in the U.S. have implemented renewable portfolio standards, which generally mandate that a specified percentage of electricity sales in the state be attributable to renewable energy sources, and Congress has considered legislation that would impose a similar federal mandate. Further, governmental agencies have been providing grants and other financial incentives to entities developing or selling alternative energy sources with lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions, which may lead to more competition from those subsidized entities. Global treaties are also being considered that place restrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. See Item 1. Environmental Laws for additional discussion of greenhouse gas emission regulation.In addition, several regulations under the Clean Air Act were recently finalized or are expected to be finalized in 2013 that regulate emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and other air pollutants from power plants and industrial boilers. The regulations include CAIR, which establishes a cap and trade system for emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide from power plants in 27 eastern states, the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which regulates emissions of mercury and other heavy metals from power plants, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants regulating emissions of mercury and other metals and organic air toxics from industrial, commercial and institutional boilers. The EPA is also expected to issue a new rule to replace CAIR in regulating the interstate transport of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. Any such replacement rule could impose significant obligations on our customers, which could reduce the demand for coal.A well-publicized failure in December 2008 of a coal ash slurry impoundment maintained by the Tennessee Valley Authority prompted the EPA to propose regulations governing coal combustion residuals. These regulations, if finalized, may impose significant obligations on us and our customers, which could reduce demand for coal.These current and potential future international, federal, state, regional or local laws, regulations or court orders addressing greenhouse gas emissions and/or coal ash, or emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and other hazardous air pollutants and/or particulate matter, will likely require additional controls on coal-fueled power plants and industrial boilers and may cause some users of coal to close existing facilities, reduce construction of new facilities or switch from coal to alternative fuels. These ongoing and future developments may have a material adverse impact on the global supply and demand for coal, and as a result could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even in the absence of future regulatory developments, increased awareness of, and any adverse publicity regarding, greenhouse gas and other air emissions and coal ash disposal associated with coal and coal-fueled power plants, could adversely affect our and our customers’ reputations and reduce demand for coal.39As our coal supply agreements expire, our revenues and operating profits could be negatively impacted if we are unable to extend existing agreements or enter new long-term supply agreements due to competition, changing coal purchasing patterns or other variables.As our coal supply agreements expire, we will compete with other coal suppliers to renew these agreements or to obtain new sales. If we cannot renew these coal supply agreements or find alternate customers willing to purchase our coal, our revenue and operating profits could suffer.Our customers may decide not to extend existing agreements or enter into new long-term contracts or, in the absence of long-term contracts, may decide to purchase fewer tons of coal than in the past or on different terms, including under different pricing terms. Due to the public perception of our financial condition and results of operations, in particular with regard to uncertainties surrounding our bankruptcy process and reorganization, some customers could be reluctant to enter into long-term agreements with us. In recent years, a global recession resulted in decreased demand worldwide for steel and electricity. Decreases in demand may cause our customers to delay negotiations for new contracts and/or request lower pricing. Furthermore, uncertainty caused by laws and regulations affecting electricity generators could deter our customers from entering into long-term coal supply agreements. Some long-term contracts contain provisions for termination due to environmental changes if these changes prohibit utilities from burning the contracted coal. To the degree that we operate outside of long-term contracts, our revenues are subject to pricing in the spot market that can be significantly more volatile than the pricing structure negotiated through a long-term coal supply agreement. This volatility could adversely affect the profitability of our operations if spot market pricing for coal is unfavorable to us.Many of our long-term thermal coal supply agreements contain price re-opener provisions, under which the parties negotiate contract pricing for future periods. If we are unable to reach agreement with our customers under these provisions, either party may have the right to terminate the contract or submit the dispute to arbitration.Many of our long-term thermal coal supply agreements contain provisions that permit the parties to adjust the contract price for specific events, including inflation and changes in the laws regulating the production, sale or use of coal. Additionally, the majority of our long-term coal supply agreements contain provisions that allow a purchaser to terminate the contract if legislation is passed that either restricts the use or type of coal permissible at the purchaser’s plant or results in specified increases in the cost of coal or its use.Our coal supply agreements also typically contain force majeure provisions that allow the temporary suspension of performance by the affected party during the duration of specified events beyond the affected party’s control.In addition, most of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that require us to deliver coal within certain ranges for specific coal characteristics such as heat content (Btu), sulfur and ash content, moisture, grindability and ash fusion temperature. Failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties, including price adjustments, the rejection of deliveries, purchasing replacement coal in a higher priced open market or termination of the contract.To the extent our customers exercise their rights under any of the foregoing provisions, our results of operations and operating profit could be adversely affected.Risk Factors Relating to our OperationsOur operations are subject to geologic, equipment and operational risks, including events beyond our control, which could result in higher operating expenses and/or decreased production and sales and adversely affect our results of operations.Our coal mining operations are conducted in underground and surface mines. The level of our production at these mines is subject to operating conditions and events beyond our control that could disrupt operations, affect production and the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time and have a significant impact on our operating results. Adverse operating conditions and events that coal producers have experienced in the past include changes or variations in geologic conditions, such as the thickness of the coal deposits and the amount of rock embedded in or overlying the coal deposit; mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems; adverse weather and natural disasters, such as snowstorms, ice storms, heavy rains and flooding; accidental mine water inflows; and unexpected suspension of mining operations to prevent, or due to, a safety accident, including fires and explosions from methane and other sources.If any of these conditions or events occur in the future at any of our mines or affect deliveries of our coal to customers, they may increase our cost of mining, delay or halt production at particular mines, or negatively impact sales to our 40customers either permanently or for varying lengths of time, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that these risks would be covered by our insurance policies.In addition, the geological characteristics of underground coal reserves in Appalachia and the Illinois Basin, such as thinning coal seam thickness, rock partings within a coal seam, weak roof or floor rock, sandstone channel intrusions, groundwater and increased stresses within the surrounding rock mass due to over mining, under mining and overburden changes, make these coal reserves complex and costly to mine. As mines become depleted, replacement reserves may not be mineable at costs comparable to those characteristic of the depleting mines. These factors could materially and adversely affect the mining operations and the cost structures of our mining complexes and customers’ willingness to purchase our coal.We could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations, especially as we attempt to implement changes to wage and benefit programs and postretirement benefit obligations pursuant to Sections 1113 and 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code.As of December 31, 2012, Patriot had approximately 4,100 employees. Approximately 40% of our employees were represented by an organized labor union. Relations with our employees and, where applicable, organized labor are important to our success. Union employees are represented by the UMWA. In 2011, certain of our subsidiaries signed new labor agreements with the UMWA that generally extend through December 31, 2016. Our represented employees work at various sites in Appalachia and at the Highland complex in the Illinois Basin.In relation to the bankruptcy process and pursuant to Sections 1113 and 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code, Patriot is seeking to renegotiate the terms of collective bargaining agreements between certain Patriot subsidiaries and the UMWA, as well as certain postretirement healthcare benefits. The outcome of these negotiations is subject to many uncertainties and there is a risk that UMWA-represented employees may strike.Due to the increased risk of strikes and other work-related stoppages that may be associated with union operations in the coal industry, our competitors who operate without union labor may have a competitive advantage in areas where they compete with our unionized operations. If some or all of our current non-union operations were to become organized, we could incur additional costs and an increased risk of work stoppages.A prolonged shortage of skilled labor and qualified managers in our operating regions could pose a risk to labor productivity and competitive costs and could adversely affect our profitability.Efficient coal mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers with mining experience and proficiency as well as qualified managers and supervisors. We are subject to the risk that we will not be able to effectively replace the knowledge and expertise of an aging workforce as those workers retire and that there are not sufficient numbers of younger workers with the requisite skills and knowledge to replace them. Further, due to uncertainties surrounding the Bankruptcy Case, it may be more difficult for us to hire new skilled laborers and managers. A prolonged shortage of experienced labor could have an adverse impact on our productivity, our costs and our ability to expand production in the event there is an increase in the demand for our coal, all of which could adversely affect our profitability.A decrease in the availability or increase in costs of key supplies, capital equipment or commodities used in our mining operations could decrease our profitability.Our purchases of certain underground mining equipment and steel roof bolts are concentrated with one principal supplier. Further, our coal mining operations use significant amounts of steel, diesel fuel, explosives and tires. Steel is used for roof bolts that are required for the room-and-pillar method of mining. If the cost of any of these inputs increases significantly, or if a source for such mining equipment or supplies becomes unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our profitability could be reduced.Fluctuations in transportation costs, the availability or reliability of transportation facilities and our dependence on a single rail carrier for transport from certain of our mining complexes could affect the demand for our coal or temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to our customers.Coal producers depend upon rail, trucks, overland conveyors, barges, river docks, ocean-going vessels and port facilities to deliver coal to customers. While our coal customers typically arrange and pay for transportation of coal from the mine or port to the point of use, disruption of these transportation services because of weather-related problems, infrastructure damage, strikes, lock-outs, lack of fuel or maintenance items, transportation delays, lack of rail or port capacity or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to customers and thus could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.41Transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal for our customers, and the cost of transportation is an important factor in a customer’s purchasing decision. Increases in transportation costs, including increases resulting from emission control requirements and fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel and demurrage, could make coal a less competitive source of energy when compared to alternative fuels such as natural gas, or could make Appalachian and/or Illinois Basin coal production less competitive than coal produced in other regions of the U.S. or abroad.Significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition from coal producers in other parts of the country and from abroad. Coordination of the many eastern loading facilities, the large number of small shipments, terrain and labor issues all combine to make shipments originating in the eastern U.S. inherently more expensive on a per ton-mile basis than shipments originating in the western U.S. Historically, high coal transportation rates from the western coal producing areas into Central Appalachian markets limited the use of western coal in those markets. However, a decrease in rail rates from the western coal producing areas to markets served by eastern U.S. producers could create major competitive challenges for eastern producers. Increased competition due to changing transportation costs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Coal produced at certain of our mining complexes is transported to our customers by a single rail carrier. If there are significant disruptions in the rail services provided by that carrier or if the rail rates rise significantly, costs of transportation for our coal could increase substantially. Additionally, if there are disruptions of the transportation services provided by the railroad and we are unable to find alternative transportation providers to ship our coal, our business and profitability could be adversely affected.Our future success depends upon our ability to develop our existing coal reserves and to acquire additional reserves that are economically recoverable.Our recoverable reserves decline as we produce coal. We have not yet applied for many of the permits required or developed the mines necessary to use all of our proven and probable coal reserves that are economically recoverable. Furthermore, we may not be able to mine all of our proven and probable coal reserves as profitably as we do at our current operations. Our future success depends upon our conducting successful exploration and development activities and acquiring properties containing economically recoverable proven and probable coal reserves. Our current strategy includes using our existing properties and increasing our proven and probable coal reserves through acquisitions of leases and producing properties.Our planned mine development projects and acquisition activities may not result in significant additional proven and probable coal reserves and we may not have continuing success developing additional mines. A substantial portion of our proven and probable coal reserves is not located adjacent to current operations and will require significant capital expenditures to develop. In order to develop our proven and probable coal reserves, we must receive various governmental permits. We make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the governmental permits that we would need to continue developing our proven and probable coal reserves.Our mining operations are conducted on properties owned or leased by us. We may not be able to negotiate new leases from private parties or obtain mining contracts for properties containing additional proven and probable coal reserves or maintain our leasehold interest in properties on which mining operations are not commenced during the term of the lease.Inaccuracies in our estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs or decreased profitability.We base our proven and probable coal reserve information on engineering, economic and geologic data assembled and analyzed by our staff, which includes various engineers, geologists and outside firms. The reserve estimates as to both quantity and quality are annually updated to reflect production of coal from the reserves and new drilling or other data received. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of coal reserves and the costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves and net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions relating to geologic and mining conditions, relevant historical production statistics, the assumed effects of regulation and taxes, future coal prices, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs.For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities and qualities attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of coal reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of net cash flows expected from particular reserves prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially. 42Actual coal tonnage recovered from identified reserve areas or properties, revenues and expenditures with respect to our proven and probable coal reserves may vary materially from estimates. These estimates, thus, may not accurately reflect our actual coal reserves. Any inaccuracy in our estimates related to our proven and probable coal reserves could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased profitability.Any defects in title of leasehold interests in our properties could limit our ability to mine these properties or could result in significant unanticipated costs.We conduct a significant part of our mining operations on properties that we lease. These leases were entered into over a period of many years by certain of our predecessors and title to our leased properties and mineral rights may not be thoroughly verified until a permit to mine the property is obtained. Our right to mine some of our proven and probable coal reserves may be materially adversely affected if there were defects in title or boundaries. In order to obtain leases or mining contracts to conduct our mining operations on property where these defects exist, we may in the future have to incur unanticipated costs, which could adversely affect our profitability.Industry Regulatory RisksLike many of our competitors, we have difficulty complying with permit restrictions relating to the discharge of selenium into surface water, which has led to court challenges and related orders and settlements, our payment of fines and penalties and the imposition of requirements that may in the future require us to incur material additional costs and may be difficult to resolve or satisfy on a timely basis given current technology.Selenium is a naturally occurring element that is encountered in earthmoving operations. The extent of selenium occurrence varies depending upon site specific geologic conditions. Selenium is encountered globally in coal mining, phosphate mining and agricultural operations. In coal mining applications, selenium can be discharged to surface water when mine tailings are exposed to rain and other natural elements. Selenium effluent limits are included in permits issued to us and other coal mining companies.We have established a liability for the treatment of outfalls with known selenium exceedances. The liability reflects the estimated total costs of implementing and maintaining a Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) water treatment facility for three Apogee outfalls, an Advanced Biological Metals Removal System (ABMet) selenium treatment technology at the Hobet Surface Mine No. 22 outfall, and Iron Facilitated Selenium Reduction (IFSeR) water treatment facilities at outfalls covered by various legal actions as described in Item 3. The outfalls to be remediated using IFSeR technology were separated into five categories based on the average gallons per minute water flow at each outfall. The estimated costs of IFSeR technology were based upon the installation and operating costs at the Category 1-5 outfalls.The FBR water treatment facility for the three Apogee outfalls will be the first facility constructed for selenium removal on a commercial scale. Neither the FBR technology nor ABMet technology to be utilized at the Hobet Surface Mine No. 22 outfall has been proven effective on a full-scale commercial basis at coal mining operations, and there can be no assurance that either of these technologies will be successful under all variable conditions experienced at our mining operations.To date, IFSeR technology has not been proven to achieve effluent selenium limitations for the water flows at outfalls other than those in Category 1. There is significant uncertainty as to which technology, if any, could be utilized to achieve compliance at the other four categories, particularly those with higher average water flows. However, IFSeR technology is currently the treatment technology that is best adapted for installation and operation under the various site-specific conditions at our outfalls.If IFSeR systems are not ultimately successful in treating the effluent selenium exceedances at the outfalls covered by various legal actions as described in Item 3, we may be required to install alternative treatment solutions and may be subject to penalties or further litigation. Alternative technology solutions that we may ultimately select are still in the early phases of development and their related costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The cost of other water treatment solutions could be materially different than the costs reflected in our liability. Furthermore, costs associated with potential modifications to IFSeR or the scale of our current IFSeR systems could also cause the costs to be materially different than the costs reflected in our liability. We cannot provide an estimate of the possible additional range of costs associated with alternate treatment solutions at this time. Potential installations of selenium treatment alternatives are further complicated by the variable geological, topographical and water flow considerations of each individual outfall.While we are actively continuing to explore treatment options, there can be no assurance as to if or when a definitive solution will be identified and implemented for outfalls covered by legal actions against us. As a result, actual costs may 43differ from our current estimates. We will make additional adjustments to our liability when it becomes probable that we will utilize a different technology or modify the current technology, whether due to developments in our ongoing research, technology changes, modifications pursuant to the comprehensive consent decree or other legal obligations to do so. Additionally, there are no assurances we will meet the timetable stipulated in the various court orders, consent decrees and permits to which we are subject.With respect to all outfalls with known exceedances for selenium or any other parameter, including the specific sites discussed above, any failure to meet the deadlines set forth in our consent decrees or established by the federal government, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia (U.S. District Court) or the State of West Virginia or to otherwise comply with our permits could result in further litigation against us, an inability to obtain new permits or to maintain existing permits, which could impact our ability to mine our coal reserves, and the imposition of significant and material fines and penalties or other costs and could otherwise materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In addition to the uncertainties related to technology discussed above, future changes to legislation, compliance with judicial rulings, consent decrees and regulatory requirements, discovery of additional selenium exceedances, findings from current research initiatives and the pace of future technological progress could result in costs that differ from our current estimates. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may incur additional costs relating to the lawsuits discussed above, including potential fines and penalties relating to selenium matters. Additionally, as a result of these ongoing litigation matters and federal regulatory initiatives related to water quality standards that affect valley fills, impoundments and other mining practices, including the selenium discharge matters described above, the process of applying for new permits has become more time-consuming and complex, the review and approval process is taking longer, and in certain cases, permits may not be issued.The environmental, health and safety regulations applicable to our mining operations impose significant costs on us, and future regulations or changes in the interpretation or application or enforcement of existing regulations could increase those costs and limit our ability to produce coal.Federal and state authorities regulate the coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety, permitting and licensing requirements, the protection of the environment, plants and wildlife, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Federal and state authorities inspect our operations, and in the aftermath of the April 5, 2010 accident at a competitor’s underground mine in Central Appalachia, we and other mining companies have experienced, and may in the future continue to experience, a significant increase in the frequency and scope of these inspections. Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. We are required to prepare and present to federal, state and/or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment. In addition, significant legislation mandating specified benefits for retired coal miners affects our industry. We have in the past, and will in the future, be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations.Future legislation and regulations may become increasingly restrictive, and there may be more rigorous enforcement of existing and future laws and regulations. For example, Congress is currently considering legislation to enhance mine safety laws, which could result in additional or enhanced mine safety equipment and procedure requirements, more frequent mine inspections, stricter enforcement practices, enhanced reporting and miner training requirements, higher penalties for certain violations of safety rules and increased authority for MSHA. West Virginia regulatory authorities are also considering enhanced mine safety laws, which could potentially result in more stringent equipment and procedure requirements.The costs, liabilities and requirements associated with addressing the outcome of inspections and complying with these environmental, health and safety requirements are often significant and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production. New or revised legislation or administrative regulations (or a change in judicial or administrative interpretation, application or enforcement of existing laws and regulations), including proposals related to the protection of the environment or employee health and safety, that would further regulate and tax the coal industry and/or users of coal, may also require us or our customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs, which may materially adversely affect our mining operations and our cost structure. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines or penalties, the acceleration of cleanup and site restoration costs, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations and the 44suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations. Additionally, MSHA may order the temporary closure of mines in the event of certain violations of safety rules. Our customers may challenge our issuance of force majeure notices in connection with such closures. If these challenges are successful, we could be obligated to make up lost shipments, to reimburse customers for the additional costs to purchase replacement coal, or, in some cases, to terminate certain sales contracts. Existing and future environmental, health and safety regulations, and the enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Increased focus by regulatory authorities on the effects of surface coal mining on the environment and recent regulatory developments related to surface coal mining operations could make it more difficult or increase our costs to receive new permits or to comply with our existing permits to mine coal in Appalachia or otherwise adversely affect us.Regulatory agencies are increasingly focused on the effects of surface coal mining on the environment, particularly as it relates to water quality, which has resulted in more rigorous permitting requirements and enforcement efforts.Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires mining companies to obtain ACOE permits to place material in streams for the purpose of creating slurry ponds, water impoundments, refuse areas, valley fills or other mining activities. As is the case with other coal mining companies operating in Appalachia, our construction and mining activities, including certain of our surface mining operations, frequently require Section 404 permits. The issuance of permits to construct valley fills and refuse impoundments under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act has been the subject of many court cases and increased regulatory oversight, resulting in additional permitting requirements that are expected to delay or even prevent the opening of new mines. See Item 1. Environmental Laws for additional description of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.For example, in July 2011, the EPA issued final comprehensive guidance establishing threshold conductivity levels to be used as a basis for evaluating compliance with narrative water quality standards. Though a federal district court set aside this guidance in July 2012, the EPA has appealed this decision. If the guidance is reinstated, we and other mining companies could be subject to more stringent permit requirements. There can be no guarantee that we would be able to meet these permit requirements or any other standards imposed by our permits.Additionally, in January 2011, the EPA rescinded a federal Clean Water Act permit held by another coal mining company for a surface mine in Appalachia citing associated environmental damage and degradation. While our operations were not directly impacted, and a federal district court has since reinstated the permit, this could be an indication that other surface mining water permits could be subject to more substantial review in the future. In addition, the federal Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation is considering rewriting the Stream Protection Rule. As rewritten, this rule could require us to comply with more stringent mining and reclamation obligations near water sources, or refrain from mining certain of our reserves.A recent settlement and consent decree modification between Patriot and environmental non-governmental organizations also demonstrates regulatory authorities’ increased focus on the effects of surface coal mining and the regulatory impediments to large-scale surface mining operations. In December 2012, the Bankruptcy Court and the U.S. District Court approved an agreement between Patriot and such non-governmental organizations regarding claims under the Clean Water Act relating to surface mining activities in West Virginia. In exchange for extensions of technology selection and specified compliance dates related to selenium discharge limits, Patriot agreed to, among other things, impose interim caps on surface mining coal production beginning in 2014 and leading to a permanent annual cap beginning in 2018, retire its Paint Creek surface mine dragline in 2013 and its Hobet surface mine dragline in 2015, and refrain from certain new large-scale surface mining operations.It is unknown what future changes will be implemented to the permitting review and issuance process or to other aspects of surface mining operations, but increased regulatory focus, future laws and judicial decisions and any other future changes could materially and adversely affect all coal mining companies operating in Appalachia, including us. In particular, we will incur additional permitting and operating costs, could be unable to obtain new permits or maintain existing permits and could incur fines, penalties and other costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. If surface coal mining methods are limited or prohibited further, it could significantly increase our operational costs and make it more difficult to economically recover our reserves. In the event that we cannot increase the price we charge for coal to cover the higher production costs without reducing customer demand for our coal, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased public focus on the 45environmental, health and aesthetic impacts of surface coal mining could harm our reputation and reduce demand for coal.Due to our participation in multi-employer pension plans and statutory retiree healthcare plans, we may have exposure that extends beyond what our obligations would be with respect to our employees.Certain of our subsidiaries participate in the 1974 Plan, a multi-employer pension fund, that was established as a result of collective bargaining with the UMWA pursuant to the 2007 NBCWA, as periodically negotiated and adjusted based on the 2011 NBCWA. The plan provides pension and disability pension benefits to qualifying represented employees upon retirement. The funding is based on an hourly rate for active UMWA workers. The 2011 NBCWA requires funding at $5.50 per hour for certain UMWA workers. As of May 25, 2012, the 1974 Plan adopted a funding improvement plan under which the contribution rate is scheduled to increase in stages, beginning in 2017, from the current $5.50 per hour to a minimum of $12.50 per hour in 2017 up to a maximum potential rate of $26.50 per hour as early as 2022. Certain of our other subsidiaries have entered into other labor agreements with the UMWA that contain terms that differ from the terms of the 2011 NBCWA and that do not provide for participation in or contribution to the 1974 Plan.Under the 2011 NBCWA, new inexperienced miners hired after January 1, 2012 do not participate in the 1974 Plan. Instead, for each hour worked, the Company contributes $1.00 into the UMWA Cash Deferral Plan on the employee’s behalf, increasing to $1.50 on January 1, 2014. Effective January 1, 2012, employers also pay $1.50 per hour to a new Retiree Bonus Account Trust (Trust) for the term of the 2011 NBCWA. This Trust will make a payment to pensioners in November of 2014, 2015 and 2016 in the amount of $580 for most retirees and $455 for disabled retirees. If Trust funding is not sufficient to make these annual bonus payments, employers will pay the difference directly to their retirees.Under the 2011 NBCWA, effective January 1, 2012, employers also make an additional supplemental pension contribution of $1.00 per hour worked into the UMWA Cash Deferred Savings Plan for each active miner with at least 20 years of credited service under the 1974 Plan, increasing to $1.50 per hour on January 1, 2014. Effective January 1, 2012, any participant in the 1974 Plan may make an irrevocable election to opt out of the 1974 Plan. Such employee will cease to accrue any further service or benefits under the 1974 Plan. Effective with the election, employers contribute $1.00 per hour worked to the UMWA Cash Deferred Plan on the employee’s behalf as a Supplemental Pension Contribution, increasing to $1.50 on January 1, 2014.Contributions to these funds could increase as a result of future collective bargaining with the UMWA, a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency of other coal companies who currently contribute to these funds, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Even with these increased rates, the difficult equity markets over recent years have resulted in materially underfunded multi-employer pension funds and any new rates assigned may be higher than the current rate as this deficit is addressed.The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2006 (2006 Act) authorized $490 million in general fund revenues to pay for certain benefits, including the healthcare costs under the UMWA Combined Fund, 1992 Benefit Plan and 1993 Benefit Plan for former employees of defunct entities (orphans) who are retirees and their dependents. Under the 2006 Act, these orphan benefits will be the responsibility of the federal government on a phased-in basis through 2012. If Congress were to amend or repeal the 2006 Act or if the $490 million authorization were insufficient to pay for these healthcare costs, certain of our subsidiaries, along with other contributing employers and their affiliates, would be responsible for the excess costs.Our operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to us.Certain of our current and historical coal mining operations have used hazardous materials and, to the extent that such materials are not recycled, they could become hazardous waste. We may be subject to claims under federal and state statutes and/or common law doctrines for toxic torts and other damages, as well as for natural resource damages and for the investigation and remediation of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media under laws such as CERCLA, commonly known as Superfund. Such claims may arise, for example, out of current or former conditions at sites that we own or operate currently, as well as at sites that we and companies we acquired, owned or operated in the past, and at contaminated sites that have always been owned or operated by third parties with whom we do business. Liability may be without regard to fault and may be strict, joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or related damages, or even for the entire share.We maintain coal slurry impoundments at a number of our mines. Such impoundments are subject to extensive regulation. Structural failure of an impoundment can result in extensive damage to the environment and natural resources, 46such as streams or bodies of water and wildlife, as well as related personal injuries and property damage, which in turn can give rise to extensive liability. Some of our impoundments overlie areas where some mining has occurred, which can pose a heightened risk of failure and of damages arising out of failure. If one of our impoundments were to fail, we could be subject to substantial claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability, as well as for fines and penalties.These and other similar unforeseen impacts that our operations may have on the environment, as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations, could result in costs and liabilities that could adversely affect us.We are involved in legal proceedings, and may become subject to other legal proceedings in the future, that, if determined adversely to us, could significantly impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business and may become subject to other legal proceedings in the future. Some of the lawsuits seek fines or penalties and damages in very large amounts, or seek to restrict our business activities. It is currently unknown what the ultimate resolution of these proceedings will be, but the costs of resolving these proceedings could be material, and could result in an obligation to change our operations in a manner that could have an adverse effect on us. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a full description of current claims and litigation.We have significant reclamation and mine closure obligations. If our actual costs vary from our estimates, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated.SMCRA establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining, as well as most aspects of deep mining. We calculate the total estimated reclamation and mine-closing liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine-closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and our engineering expertise related to these requirements. As of December 31, 2012, we had accrued reserves of $124.6 million for reclamation liabilities and an additional $164.0 million for mine closure costs, including medical benefits for employees and water treatment due to mine closure. The estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed annually by our management and engineers. The estimated liability could change significantly if actual costs or timing vary from assumptions, if the underlying facts change or if governmental requirements change significantly.Risk Factors Relating to Financial and Other Aspects of our BusinessFailure to obtain or renew surety bonds in a timely manner and on acceptable terms could affect our ability to secure reclamation and employee-related obligations, which could adversely affect our ability to mine coal.U.S. federal and state laws require us to secure certain of our obligations relating to reclaiming land used for mining, paying federal and state workers’ compensation, and satisfying other miscellaneous obligations. The primary method for us to meet those obligations is to provide a third-party surety bond or letter of credit. As of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit aggregating $564.9 million, of which $354.5 million was for post-mining reclamation, $132.6 million related to workers’ compensation obligations, $54.4 million was for retiree health obligations and $23.5 million was for other obligations (including collateral for surety companies and bank guarantees, road maintenance and performance guarantees). Some of these bonds are renewable on an annual basis and the letters of credit are available through the DIP Facilities.As of December 31, 2012, Arch Coal, Inc. (Arch) posted surety bonds of $34.3 million related to properties acquired by Patriot in the Magnum acquisition, of which $33.1 million related to reclamation. Magnum posted a letter of credit in Arch’s favor, as required, for a portion of the outstanding reclamation bonds. As part of the bankruptcy proceedings, our prior surety agreement with Arch was terminated and replaced with a new surety agreement.Economic recession, volatility and disruption in the credit markets could result in surety bond issuers deciding not to continue to renew the bonds or to demand additional collateral upon those renewals. Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds or to provide a suitable alternative would have a material adverse effect on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors including lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new surety bonds, restrictions on the availability of collateral for current and future third-party surety bond issuers under the terms of our DIP Facilites and the exercise by third-party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety.47We could be adversely affected by a decline in the creditworthiness or financial condition of our customers.Our ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. Our customer base has changed with deregulation as some utilities have sold their power plants to non-regulated affiliates or third parties. These new customers may have credit ratings that are below investment grade. If the creditworthiness of our customers declines significantly and customers fail to make their payments, our business could be adversely affected.During and subsequent to economic recessions, many companies struggle to maintain their businesses and are subject to an increased risk of bankruptcy. If our customers seek protection under the federal bankruptcy laws, they could terminate all or a portion of their business with us and/or originate new business with our competitors. If our customers are significantly and negatively impacted by the challenging economic conditions, or by other business factors, or if any of our significant customers seek bankruptcy protection, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.If our actual benefit plan costs vary from our estimates, then expenditures for these benefits could be materially higher than we have estimated and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We provide various health and welfare benefits to eligible active employees and certain retired employees. We make assumptions in order to calculate our obligations for future spending related to these employee benefit plans, including costs related to the 2010 Healthcare Legislation. The 2010 Healthcare Legislation impacts our costs to provide healthcare benefits to our eligible active and certain retired employees and to provide workers’ compensation benefits related to occupational disease resulting from black lung disease.Beginning in 2018, the 2010 Healthcare Legislation will impose a 40% excise tax on employers to the extent that the value of their healthcare plan coverage exceeds certain dollar thresholds. We anticipate that certain government agencies will provide additional regulations or interpretations concerning the application of this excise tax. Until these regulations or interpretations are published, it is impractical to reasonably estimate the ultimate impact of the excise tax on our future healthcare costs or postretirement benefit obligation. We have incorporated changes to our actuarial assumptions to determine our postretirement benefit obligations utilizing preliminary estimates and basic assumptions around the pending interpretations of these regulations.We provide postretirement health and life insurance benefits to eligible union and non-union employees. We calculated the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. We estimated the present value of the obligation to be $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2012. We have estimated these unfunded obligations based on actuarial assumptions described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.Additional regulations or interpretations concerning the 2010 Healthcare Legislation could have a material adverse impact on our healthcare costs. Additionally, if our actual experience does not match our assumptions, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and our cash expenditures and costs incurred for employee benefit plans could be materially higher.We could be liable for certain retiree healthcare obligations assumed by Peabody in connection with the spin-off.In connection with the spin-off, a Peabody subsidiary assumed certain retiree healthcare obligations of Patriot and its subsidiaries having a present value of $637.6 million as of December 31, 2012. These obligations arise under the Coal Act, the 2007 NBCWA and predecessor and successor agreements and the subsidiary’s salaried retiree healthcare plan.Although the Peabody subsidiary is obligated to pay such obligations, certain Patriot subsidiaries also remain jointly and severally liable for the Coal Act obligations, and secondarily liable for the assumed 2007 NBCWA obligations and retiree healthcare obligations for certain participants under the subsidiary’s retiree healthcare plan. As a consequence, Patriot’s recorded retiree healthcare obligations and related cash costs could increase substantially if the Peabody subsidiary would fail to perform its obligations under the liability assumption agreements. These additional liabilities and costs, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Terrorist attacks against U.S. targets, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the U.S. or its allies, or military or trade disruptions affecting our customers or the economy as a whole may materially adversely affect our operations or those of our customers. As a result, there could be delays or losses in transportation and deliveries of coal to our customers, decreased sales of our coal and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from our customers. 48Strategic targets such as energy-related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the U.S. In addition, disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government-imposed price controls. Any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.None.49
