Item 1A. Risk Factors The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. Our business is subject to a number of economic risks. Financial markets worldwide experienced extreme disruption in the past three years, including, among other things, extreme volatility in securities prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. Governments took unprecedented actions intended to address extreme market conditions such as severely restricted credit and declines in real estate values. Such economic events can recur and can potentially affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. Tightening of credit in financial markets and a slowing economy adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant operations, can result in lower demand for our products and services, and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders included in our backlog and adversely affect the collectability of our receivables. Additionally, tightening of credit in financial markets coupled with a slowing economy could negatively impact our cost of capital and ability to grow. Our business is also adversely affected when energy demand declines as a result of lower overall economic activity. Typically, lower energy demand negatively affects commodity prices which reduces the earnings and cash flow of our E&P and mining customers, reducing their spending and demand for our products and services. These conditions could have an adverse effect on our operating results and our ability to recover our assets at their stated values. Likewise, our suppliers may be unable to sustain their current level of operations, fulfill their commitments and/or fund future operations and obligations, each of which could adversely affect our operations. Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. Dollar against certain major currencies, such as the Euro, the British Pound and the Canadian and Australian Dollar, could also adversely affect our results. Decreased customer expenditure levels will adversely affect our results of operations. Demand for our products and services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and gas and mining companies, including national oil companies. If our customers expenditures decline, our business will suffer. The industrys willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon the availability of attractive drilling prospects and the prevailing view of future commodity prices. Prices for oil, coal, natural gas, and other minerals are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control. A sudden or long-term decline in product pricing would have material adverse effects on our results of operations. Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress levels of exploration, development, and production activity, often reflected as reductions in rig counts. Additionally, significant new regulatory requirements, including climate change legislation, could have an impact on the demand for and the cost of producing oil and gas. Many factors affect the supply and demand for oil, coal, natural gas and other minerals and, therefore, influence product prices, including:  the level of drilling activity;  the level of production;  the levels of oil and natural gas inventories;  depletion rates;  the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas;  the expected cost of finding, developing and producing new reserves;  delays in major offshore and onshore oil and natural gas field development timetables; 18 Table of Contents  the level of activity and developments in the Canadian oil sands;  the level of demand for coal and other natural resources from Australia;  the availability of attractive oil and natural gas field prospects, which may be affected by governmental actions or environmental activists which may restrict drilling;  the availability of transportation infrastructure, refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;  global weather conditions and natural disasters;  worldwide economic activity including growth in underdeveloped countries, such as China and India;  national government political requirements, including the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC) to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil and government policies which could nationalize or expropriate oil and natural gas exploration, production, refining or transportation assets;  the level of oil and gas production by non-OPEC countries;  the impact of armed hostilities involving one or more oil producing nations;  rapid technological change and the timing and extent of alternative energy sources, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) or other alternative fuels;  environmental regulation; and  domestic and foreign tax policies. Our business may be adversely affected by extended periods of low oil prices or unsuccessful exploration results may decrease deepwater exploration and production activity or oil sands development and production in Canada. Two of our businesses, where we manufacture offshore products for deepwater exploration and production and where we supply accommodations for oil sands developments, typically support our customers projects that are more capital intensive and take longer to generate first production than traditional oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. The economic analyses conducted by exploration and production companies in deepwater and oil sands areas have historically assumed a relatively conservative longer-term price outlook for production from such projects to determine economic viability. Perceptions of lower longer-term oil prices by these companies can cause our customers to reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large scale development projects, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability in our offshore products segment and our accommodations segment. Federal legislation and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays as well as adversely affect our services. The federal Congress is currently considering two companion bills in the United States, known as the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, or FRAC Act, that would repeal an exemption in the federal Safe Drinking Water Act for the underground injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids near drinking water sources. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in formations with low permeabilities, such as shale formations, and involves the pressurized injection of water, sand and chemicals into rock formations to stimulate production. Sponsors of the FRAC Act have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies. If enacted, the FRAC Act could result in additional regulatory burdens such as permitting, construction, financial assurance, monitoring, recordkeeping, and plugging and abandonment requirements. The FRAC Act also proposes requiring the disclosure of chemical constituents used in the fracturing process to state or federal regulatory authorities, who would then make such information publicly available. The availability of this information could make it easier for third parties 19 Table of Contents opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. The Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the U.S. House of Representatives is currently examining the practice of hydraulic fracturing in the United States and is gathering information on its potential impacts on human health and the environment. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. In addition, various state and local governments have implemented or are considering increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain environmentally sensitive areas such as certain watersheds. The adoption of the FRAC Act or any other federal, state or local laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in certain formations, increase our costs of compliance, and adversely affect the demand for the well site services that we provide. Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the Macondo well incident and the resulting changes in regulation of offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development activity. The U.S. Department of the Interior has issued Notices to Lessees and Operators (NTLs), has implemented additional safety and certification requirements applicable to drilling activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, has imposed additional requirements with respect to development and production activities in U.S. waters and has delayed the approval of drilling plans and well permits in both deepwater and shallow-water areas. The delays caused by new regulations and requirements have and will continue to have an overall negative effect on Gulf of Mexico drilling activity, and to a certain extent, our financial results. The Macondo well incident, the subsequent oil spill and moratorium on drilling has caused offshore drilling delays, and is expected to result in increased state, federal and international regulation of our and our customers operations that could negatively impact our earnings, prospects and the availability and cost of insurance coverage. This delay could result in decreased demand for all of our business segments. There have been a variety of proposals to change existing laws and regulations that could affect offshore development and production, including proposals to significantly increase the minimum financial responsibility demonstration required under the federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Any increased regulation of the exploration and production industry as a whole that arises out of the Macondo well incident could result in fewer companies being financially qualified to operate offshore in the U.S., could result in higher operating costs for our customers and could reduce demand for our services. We have a significant concentration of our accommodations business located in the oil sands region of Alberta, Canada. Because of the concentration of our accommodations business in the Canadian oil sands in one relatively small geographic area, we have increased exposure to political, regulatory, environmental, labor, climate or natural disaster events or developments that could negatively impact our operations and financial results. In our accommodations business supporting mining, our clients production or price issues may adversely affect us. The volumes and prices of the products of our clients, including coal and gold, have historically varied significantly and are difficult to predict. The demand for, and price of, these minerals and commodities is highly dependent on a variety of factors, including international supply and demand, the price and availability of alternative fuels, actions taken by governments and global economic and political developments. Mineral and commodity prices have fluctuated in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. We expect that a material decline in mineral and commodity prices could result in a decrease in the activity of our clients with the possibility that this would materially adversely affect us. No assurance can be given regarding future volumes and/or prices relating to the activities of our clients. 20 Table of Contents Because the oil and gas industry is cyclical, our operating results may fluctuate. Oil and natural gas prices have been and are expected to remain volatile. This volatility causes oil and gas companies and drilling contractors to change their strategies and expenditure levels. Supplies of oil and natural gas can be influenced by many factors, including improved technology such as the hydraulic fracturing of horizontally drilled wells in shale discoveries, access to potential productive regions and availability of required infrastructure to deliver production to the marketplace. We have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, significant fluctuations in operating results based on these changes. The cyclical nature of our business and a severe prolonged downturn could negatively affect the value of our goodwill. As of December 31, 2010, goodwill represented approximately 16% of our total assets. We have recorded goodwill because we paid more for some of our businesses than the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets of those businesses. Current accounting standards, which were effective January 1, 2002, require a periodic review of goodwill for impairment in value and a non-cash charge against earnings with a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity if circumstances, some of which are beyond our control, indicate that the carrying amount will not be recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized an impairment of a portion of our goodwill totaling $85.6 million as a result of several factors affecting our tubular services and drilling reporting units. In the second quarter of 2009, we recognized an impairment of $94.5 million representing a portion of our remaining goodwill as a result of several factors affecting our rental tools reporting unit. It is possible that we could recognize additional goodwill impairment losses in the future if, among other factors:  global economic conditions deteriorate;  the outlook for future profits and cash flow for any of our reporting units deteriorate as the result of many possible factors, including, but not limited to, increased or unanticipated competition, technology becoming obsolete, further reductions in customer capital spending plans, loss of key personnel, adverse legal or regulatory judgment(s), future operating losses at a reporting unit, downward forecast revisions, or restructuring plans;  costs of equity or debt capital increase further; or  valuations for comparable public companies or comparable acquisition valuations deteriorate further. The level and pricing of tubular goods imported into the United States could decrease demand for our tubular goods inventory and adversely impact our results of operations. Also, if steel mills were to sell a substantial amount of goods directly to end users in the United States, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Although imports of OCTG from China are currently restricted by trade sanctions imposed by the U.S. government, lower-priced tubular goods from a number of foreign countries are still imported into the U.S. tubular goods market. If the level of imported lower-priced tubular goods were to otherwise increase from current levels, our tubular services segment could be adversely affected to the extent that we would then have higher-cost tubular goods in inventory or if prices and margins are driven down by increased supplies of tubular goods. If prices were to decrease significantly, we might not be able to profitably sell our inventory of tubular goods. In addition, significant price decreases could result in a longer holding period for some of our inventory, which could also have an adverse effect on our tubular services segment. We do not manufacture any of the tubular goods that we distribute. Historically, users of tubular goods in the United States, in contrast to those outside the United States, have purchased tubular goods through distributors. If customers were to purchase tubular goods directly from steel mills, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. 21 Table of Contents We do business in international jurisdictions whose political and regulatory environments and compliance regimes differ from those in the United States. A portion of our revenue is attributable to operations in foreign countries. These activities accounted for approximately 29% (7.9% excluding Canada) of our consolidated revenue in the year ended December 31, 2010. Risks associated with our operations in foreign areas include, but are not limited to:  war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets;  expropriation, confiscation or nationalization of assets;  renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;  foreign exchange restrictions;  foreign currency fluctuations;  foreign taxation;  the inability to repatriate earnings or capital;  changing political conditions;  changing foreign and domestic monetary policies;  social, political, military and economic situations in foreign areas where we do business and the possibilities of war, other armed conflict or terrorist attacks; and  regional economic downturns. Additionally, in some jurisdictions we are subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations may adversely affect our ability to compete. Our international business operations also include projects in countries where governmental corruption has been known to exist and where our competitors who are not subject to the same ethics related laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the U.S. and the Anti-Bribery law in the U.K., can gain competitive advantages over us by securing business awards, licenses or other preferential treatment in those jurisdictions using methods that certain ethics related laws and regulations prohibit us from using. For example, our non-U.S. competitors are not subject to the anti-bribery restrictions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which make it illegal to give anything of value to foreign officials or employees or agents of nationally owned oil companies in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantage. While many countries, like the U.S. and the U.K., have adopted similar anti-bribery statutes, there has not been universal adoption and enforcement of such statutes. Therefore, we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence. Violations of these laws could result in monetary and criminal penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business. We are subject to extensive and costly environmental laws and regulations that may require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations. All of our operations are significantly affected by stringent and complex foreign, federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. We could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change in the future, possibly resulting in more stringent requirements. If existing regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change or are more stringently enforced, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. 22 Table of Contents Any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including the:  issuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;  denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations;  reduction or cessation in operations; and  performance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions. We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change. Climate change is receiving increasing attention from scientists and legislators alike. The debate is ongoing as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the potential causes of this change and its potential impacts. Some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. A significant focus is being made on companies that are active producers of depleting natural resources. There are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions, which are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The outcome of foreign, U.S. federal, regional, provincial and state actions to address global climate change could result in a variety of regulatory programs including potential new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, or other regulatory actions. These actions could:  result in increased costs associated with our operations and our customers operations;  increase other costs to our business;  adversely impact overall drilling activity in the areas in which we operate;  reduce the demand for carbon-based fuels; and  reduce the demand for our services. Any adoption by foreign, U.S. federal, regional or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and implementation of the Kyoto Protocol (the Copenhagen Accord,) or other foreign, U.S. federal, regional or state requirements or other efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or demand for our services. See Item 1. Government Regulation for a more detailed description of our climate-change related risks. Currently proposed legislative changes could materially, negatively impact the Company, increase the costs of doing business and decrease the demand for our products. The current U.S. administration and Congress have proposed several new articles of legislation or legislative and administration changes which could have a material negative effect on our Company. Some of the proposed changes that could negatively impact us are:  cap and trade system for emissions;  increase environmental limits on exploration and production activities;  repeal of expensing of intangible drilling costs;  increase of the amortization period for geological and geophysical costs to seven years;  repeal of percentage depletion;  limits on hydraulic fracturing or disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids; 23 Table of Contents  repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction for oil and natural gas production;  repeal of the passive loss exception for working interests in oil and natural gas properties;  repeal of the credits for enhanced oil recovery projects and production from marginal wells;  repeal of the deduction for tertiary injectants;  changes to the foreign tax credit limitation calculation; and  changes to healthcare rules and regulations. Our customers in the accommodations business are exposed to a number of unique operating risks which could also adversely affect us. We could be materially adversely affected by disruptions to the operation of our clients caused by any one of or all of the following singularly or in combination:  domestic and international pricing and demand for the natural resource being produced at a given project (or proposed project);  unexpected problems and delays during the development, construction and project start-up which may delay the commencement of production;  unforeseen and adverse climatic, geological, geotechnical, seismic and mining conditions;  lack of availability of sufficient water or power to maintain their or our operations;  lack of availability or failure of the required infrastructure necessary to maintain or to expand their operations;  the breakdown or shortage of equipment and labor necessary to maintain their or our operations;  risks associated with the natural resources industry being subject to various regulatory approvals. Such risks may include a Government Agency failing to grant an approval or failing to renew an existing approval, or the approval or renewal not being provided by the Government Agency in a timely manner or the Government Agency granting or renewing an approval subject to materially onerous conditions;  risks to land titles, mining titles and use thereof as a result of native title claims;  claims by persons living in close proximity to mining projects, which may have an impact on the consents granted;  interruptions to the operations of our clients caused by industrial accidents or disputation; and  delays in or failure to commission new infrastructure in timeframes so as not to disrupt client operations. Our accommodations business is exposed to a number of general risks that could materially adversely affect our assets and liabilities, financial position, profits, prospects and share price. Examples of these broad general risks which may impact our performance include:  abnormal stoppages in the production or delivery of the products of our clients due to factors such as industrial disruption, infrastructure failure, war, political or civil unrest;  cost overruns in the provision of new rooms or in other associated or related capital expenditure;  higher than budgeted costs associated with the provision of accommodations services;  our clients not renewing their contracts, renewing them on less favorable terms, or other loss of clients;  failure of our clients to meet their obligations under their contracts;  extreme weather conditions adversely affecting our operations or the operations of our clients; and 24 Table of Contents  a major disaster at one or more of our large accommodations facilities involving fire, communicable diseases, criminal acts or other events causing significant reputational damage. Development of permanent infrastructure in the oil sands region or regions of Australia where we locate accommodations villages could negatively impact our accommodations business. Our accommodations business specializes in providing housing and personnel logistics for work forces in remote areas which lack the infrastructure typically available in nearby towns and cities. If permanent towns, cities and municipal infrastructure develop in the oil sands region of northern Alberta, Canada, or regions of Australia where we locate accommodations villages demand for our accommodations could decrease as customer employees move to the region and choose to utilize permanent housing and food services. Construction risks exist in our accommodations business. There are a number of general risks that might impinge on companies involved in the development, construction, manufacture and installation of facilities as a prerequisite to the management of those assets in an operational sense. We might be exposed to these risks from time to time by relying on these corporations and/or other third parties which could include any and/or all of the following;  the construction activities of our accommodations business are partially dependent on the supply of appropriate construction and development opportunities;  development approvals, slow decision making by counterparties, complex construction specifications, changes to design briefs, legal issues and other documentation changes may give rise to delays in completion, loss of revenue and cost over-runs. Delays in completion may, in turn, result in liquidated damages and termination of accommodation supply contracts;  other time delays that may arise in relation to construction and development include supply of labor, scarcity of construction materials, lower than expected productivity levels, inclement weather conditions, land contamination, cultural heritage claims, difficult site access, or industrial relations issues;  objections aired by community interest, environment and/or neighborhood groups which may cause delays in the granting or approvals and/or the overall progress of a project;  where we assume design responsibility, there is a risk that design problems or defects may result in rectification and/or costs or liabilities which we cannot readily recover; and  there is a risk that we may fail to fulfill our statutory and contractual obligations in relation to the quality of our materials and workmanship, including warranties and defect liability obligations. We are susceptible to seasonal earnings volatility due to adverse weather conditions in our regions of operations. Our operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate, most notably in Canada, Australia, the Rocky Mountain region and the Gulf of Mexico. A portion of our Canadian accommodations operations is conducted during the winter months when the winter freeze in remote regions is required for exploration and production activity to occur. The spring thaw in these frontier regions restricts operations in the spring months and, as a result, adversely affects our operations and sales of products and services in the second and, to a lesser extent, third quarters. Our operations in the Gulf of Mexico are also affected by weather patterns. Weather conditions in the Gulf Coast region generally result in higher drilling activity in the spring, summer and fall months with the lowest activity in the winter months. As a result of these seasonal differences, full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters. In addition, summer and fall drilling activity can be restricted due to hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Gulf Coast. For example, during 2005, a significant disruption occurred in oil and natural gas drilling and production operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to damage inflicted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and, during 2008, from Hurricane Ike. Cyclones can affect our operations in Australia. 25 Table of Contents We are exposed to risk relating to subcontractors performance in some of our projects. In many cases, we subcontract the performance of parts of our operations to subcontractors. While we seek to obtain appropriate indemnities and guarantees from these subcontractors, we remain ultimately responsible for the performance of our subcontractors. Industrial disputes, natural disasters, financial failure or default or inadequate performance in the provision of services, or the inability to provide services by such subcontractors has the potential to materially adversely affect us. Our inability to control the inherent risks of acquiring and integrating businesses could adversely affect our operations. Acquisitions have been, and our management believes acquisitions will continue to be, a key element of our growth strategy. We may not be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on favorable terms in the future. We may be required to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity securities in connection with such acquisitions. Such additional debt service requirements could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition. The issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to stockholders. We expect to gain certain business, financial and strategic advantages as a result of business combinations we undertake, including synergies and operating efficiencies. Our forward-looking statements assume that we will successfully integrate our business acquisitions and realize these intended benefits. An inability to realize expected strategic advantages as a result of the acquisition would negatively affect the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Additional risks we could face in connection with acquisitions include:  retaining key employees of acquired businesses;  retaining and attracting new customers of acquired businesses;  retaining supply and distribution relationships key to the supply chain;  increased administrative burden;  developing our sales and marketing capabilities;  managing our growth effectively;  potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition;  integrating operations;  operating a new line of business; and  increased logistical problems common to large, expansive operations. Additionally, an acquisition may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have previously experienced. If we fail to manage any of these risks successfully, our business could be harmed. Our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly following an acquisition, and shareholders of the Company may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions. We may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities. Our operations are subject to many hazards. We face the following risks under our insurance coverage:  we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;  we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance, such as damages from environmental contamination or terrorist attacks;  the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits; 26 Table of Contents  the counterparties to our insurance contracts may pose credit risks; and  we may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage. Even a partially uninsured or underinsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position. We are subject to litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance. In the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations, products, employees and other matters, including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations. Some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have sold, and some relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired, even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses. We maintain insurance to cover many of our potential losses, and we are subject to various self-retentions and deductibles under our insurance. It is possible, however, that a judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. Our concentration of customers in two industries may impact overall exposure to credit risk. Substantially all of our customers operate in the energy or mining industries. This concentration of customers in two industries may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables. Our common stock price has been volatile. The market price of common stock of companies engaged in the oil and gas services industry has been highly volatile. Likewise, the market price of our common stock has varied significantly (2010 low of $34.20 per share; 2010 high of $65.31 per share) in the past, and we expect it to continue to remain highly volatile. We may assume contractual risk in developing, manufacturing and delivering products in our offshore products business segment. Many of our products from our offshore products segment are ordered by customers under frame agreements or project specific contracts. In some cases these contracts stipulate a fixed price for the delivery of our products and impose liquidated damages or late delivery fees if we do not meet specific customer deadlines. In addition, some customer contracts stipulate consequential damages payable, generally as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. The final delivered products may also include customer and third party supplied equipment, the delay of which can negatively impact our ability to deliver our products on time at our anticipated profitability. In certain cases these orders include new technology or unspecified design elements. In some cases we may not be fully or properly compensated for the cost to develop and design the final products, negatively impacting our profitability on the projects. In addition, our customers, in many cases, request changes to the original design or bid specifications for which we may not be fully or properly compensated. As is customary for our offshore products segment, we agree to provide products under fixed-price contracts, typically assuming responsibility for cost overruns. Our actual costs and any gross profit realized on these fixed-price contracts may vary from the initially expected contract economics. There is inherent risk in the estimation process including significant unforeseen technical and logistical challenges or longer than expected lead times. A fixed-price contract may prohibit our ability to mitigate the impact of unanticipated increases in raw material prices (including the price of steel) through increased pricing. In fulfilling some contracts, we provide limited warranties for our products. Although we estimate and record a provision for potential warranty claims, repair or replacement costs under warranty provisions in our contracts could exceed the estimated cost to cure the claim which could be material to our financial results. We utilize percentage completion accounting, depending on the size of a project 27 Table of Contents and variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant impact on our reported operating results as we progress toward completion of major jobs. Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an imperfect indicator of our future revenues and earnings. The revenues projected in our backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not result in profits. Because of potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers projects, we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be realized. In addition, even where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that contracted parties may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us. Material delays, cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Reductions in our backlog due to cancellations by customers or for other reasons would adversely affect, potentially to a material extent, the revenues and earnings we actually receive from contracts included in our backlog. Some of the contracts in our backlog are cancelable by the customer, subject to the payment of termination fees and/or the reimbursement of our costs incurred. We typically have no contractual right upon cancellation to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. If we experience significant project terminations, suspensions or scope adjustments to contracts reflected in our backlog, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted. We might be unable to employ a sufficient number of technical personnel. Many of the products that we sell, especially in our offshore products segment, are complex and highly engineered and often must perform in harsh conditions. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain technical personnel with the ability to design, utilize and enhance these products. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled labor force. During periods of increased activity, the demand for skilled workers is high, and the supply is limited. We have already experienced high demand and increased wages for labor forces serving our accommodations business in Canada. When these events occur, our cost structure increases and our growth potential could be impaired. We might be unable to compete successfully with other companies in our industry. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and certain of them have relatively few barriers to entry. The principal competitive factors in our markets are product, equipment and service quality, availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, safety performance and price. In some of our business segments, we compete with the oil and gas industrys largest oilfield service providers. These large national and multi-national companies have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. Several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets. In addition, we compete with several smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements. Some contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. As a result of competition, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we do not develop new competitive technologies and products, our business and revenues may be adversely affected. The market for our offshore products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better performance in increasingly greater water depths, higher pressure levels and harsher conditions. If we are not able to design, develop and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, our business and revenues will be adversely affected. In addition, competitors or customers may develop new technology, which addresses similar or improved solutions to our existing technology. Should our technology, particularly in offshore products or in our rental tool business, become the less attractive solution, our operations and profitability would be negatively impacted. 28 Table of Contents During periods of strong demand, we may be unable to obtain critical project materials on a timely basis. Our operations depend on our ability to procure, on a timely basis, certain project materials, such as forgings, to complete projects in an efficient manner. Our inability to procure critical materials during times of strong demand could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Our oilfield operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses. Our operations are subject to the hazards inherent in the oilfield business. These include, but are not limited to, equipment defects, blowouts, explosions, fires, collisions, capsizing and severe weather conditions. These hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. We may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards as part of our ongoing business operations. We may agree to indemnify our customers against specific risks and liabilities. While we maintain insurance protection against some of these risks, and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold us harmless from some of these risks, our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective enough to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If we were to lose a significant supplier of our tubular goods, we could be adversely affected. During 2010, we purchased 56% of our total tubular goods from a single domestic supplier and 72% of our total OCTG purchases from three domestic suppliers. If we were to lose any of these suppliers or if production at one or more of the suppliers was interrupted, our tubular services segments business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If the extent of the loss or interruption were sufficiently large, the impact on us could be material. Our operations may suffer due to increased industry-wide capacity of certain types of equipment or assets. The demand for and pricing of certain types of our assets and equipment, particularly our drilling rigs and rental tool assets, is subject to the overall availability of such assets in the marketplace. If demand for our assets were to decrease, or to the extent that we and our competitors increase our fleets in excess of current demand, we may encounter decreased pricing for or utilization of our assets and services, which could adversely impact our operations and profits. In addition, we have significantly increased our accommodations capacity in the oil sands region over the past five years based on our expectation for current and future customer demand for accommodations in the area. Should our customers build their own facilities to meet their accommodations needs or our competitors likewise increase their available accommodations, or activity in the oil sands decline significantly, demand and/or pricing for our accommodations could decrease, negatively impacting the profitability of our accommodations segment. We might be unable to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our offshore products and well site services segments, particularly our patents relating to our FlexJoint® technology and intervention tools utilized in the completion or workover of oil and natural gas wells. The market success of our technologies will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce our proprietary rights in these technologies, to preserve rights in our trade secret and non-public information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. If any of our patents or other intellectual property rights are determined to be invalid or unenforceable, or if a court limits the scope of claims in a patent or fails to recognize our trade secret rights, our competitive advantages could be significantly reduced in the relevant technology, allowing competition for our customer base to increase. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The failure of our 29 Table of Contents company to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could adversely affect our competitive position. Loss of key members of our management could adversely affect our business. We depend on the continued employment and performance of key members of management. If any of our key managers resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be materially adversely affected. We do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our officers. We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and other counterparties, and a general increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by counterparties could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our counterparties are a concern in our business. We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers and other counterparties, such as our lenders and insurers. Many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. In connection with the recent economic downturn, commodity prices declined sharply, and the credit markets and availability of credit were constrained. Additionally, many of our customers equity values declined substantially. The combination of lower cash flow due to commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of available debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our customers liquidity and ability to pay or otherwise perform on their obligations to us. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. Any increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by our counterparties could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could adversely affect our liquidity. Employee and customer labor problems could adversely affect us. We are party to collective bargaining agreements covering 1,283 employees in Canada, 374 employees in Australia, 16 employees in the United Kingdom and 16 employees in Argentina. In addition, our accommodations facilities serving oil sands development work in Northern Alberta, Canada house both union and non-union customer employees. We have not experienced strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns in the recent past, but we cannot guarantee that we will not experience such events in the future. A prolonged strike, work stoppage or other slowdown by our employees or by the employees of our customers could cause us to experience a disruption of our operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares for a premium. Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, such as a classified board, limitations on the removal of directors, on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and on stockholder action by written consent and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could increase the difficulty for a third party to acquire us, which may reduce or eliminate our stockholders ability to sell their shares of common stock at a premium.
