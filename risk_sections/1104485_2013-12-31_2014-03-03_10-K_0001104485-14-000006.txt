Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.” Ryder Scott prepared our reserve report valuing our proved reserves at December 31, 2013. The report values only our proved reserves and does not value our probable reserves or our possible reserves. The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves based on the SEC rules as defined in Rule 4.10(a) of Regulation S-X and Item 1200 of Regulation S-K (“SEC Pricing Proved Reserves”). SEC Pricing Proved Reserves(1) Oil (MBbl) Natural Gas (MMcf) Total (MBoe)(2) Pre-Tax PV10% Value $M(3) PDP Properties 26,150 16,538 28,906 $ 881,698 PDNP Properties 5,893 4,105 6,577 151,080 PUD Properties 43,756 29,525 48,677 488,511 Total Proved Properties: 75,799 50,168 84,160 $ 1,521,289 _____________________ (1) The SEC Pricing Proved Reserves table above values oil and natural gas reserve quantities and related discounted future net cash flows as of December 31, 2013 assuming constant realized prices of $88.00 per barrel of oil and $5.23 per Mcf of natural gas, which includes an uplift factor of 1.4 to reflect liquids and condensates (natural gas liquids are included with natural gas). Under SEC guidelines, these prices represent the average prices per barrel of oil and per Mcf of natural gas at the beginning of each month in the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, which averages are then adjusted to reflect applicable transportation and quality differentials. (2) Boe are computed based on a conversion ratio of one Boe for each barrel of oil and one Boe for every 6,000 cubic feet (i.e., 6 Mcf) of natural gas. (3) Pre-tax PV10% may be considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC and is derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Pre-tax PV10% is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows but without deducting future income taxes. We believe Pre-tax PV10% is a useful measure for investors for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. We further believe investors may utilize our Pre-tax PV10% as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Our management uses this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties and acquisitions. However, Pre-tax PV10% is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Our Pre-tax PV10% and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. 29 The table above assumes prices and costs discounted using an annual discount rate of 10% without future escalation, without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and depreciation, depletion and amortization, or federal income taxes. The “Pre-tax PV10%” values of our proved reserves presented in the foregoing table may be considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. The following table reconciles the pre-tax PV10% value of our SEC Pricing Proved Reserves to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. SEC Pricing Proved Reserves (in thousands) Standardized Measure Reconciliation Pre-tax Present Value of estimated future net revenues (Pre-tax PV10%) $ 1,521,289 Future income taxes, discounted at 10% 296,923 Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows $ 1,224,367 Uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many risk factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating subsurface accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. As a result, estimates of proved reserves may vary depending upon the engineer valuing the reserves. Further, our actual realized price for our oil and natural gas is not likely to average the pricing parameters used to calculate our proved reserves. As such, the oil and natural gas quantities and the value of those commodities ultimately recovered from our properties will vary from reserve estimates. Additional discussion of our proved reserves is set forth under the heading “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information” to our financial statements included later in this report.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the “Selected Financial Data” in Item 6 and the Financial Statements and Accompanying Notes appearing elsewhere in this report. Overview of 2013 Results During 2013, we achieved the following financial and operating results: · Increased total production by 19% compared to 2012; · Increased total estimated proved reserves to 84.2 million Boe as of December 31, 2013, an increase of 25% compared to 2012 year-end; · Participated in the completion of 531 gross (40.0 net) wells; · Continued to high-grade and grow our leasehold position to 187,044 net acres with approximately 63% of our total acreage position either developed, held by production or held by operations as of December 31, 2013; and · Ended the year with $6 million in cash and, including availability under our revolving credit facility, liquidity of approximately $381 million. Operationally, our 2013 performance reflects another year of successfully executing our strategy of developing our acreage position and building a long-life reserve base. Our success enabled us to increase proved reserves by 16.6 million Boe, which is approximately 3.7 times our 2013 production. During 2013, production increased 19% to 4.5 million Boe as compared to 2012 production of 3.8 million Boe. The increase in 2013 production was driven by a 38% increase in producing net wells from 106.2 net wells at December 31, 2012 to 146.2 net wells at December 31, 2013. Total revenues increased 8% or $24.2 million in 2013 compared to 2012. This increase was due to higher production levels that generated $72.5 million in oil and gas revenue growth, which was partially offset by a $12.2 million loss on settled derivatives and a $21.3 million loss on the mark-to-market of derivative instruments. Average realized prices on a Boe basis (including all realized derivative settlements) were 1% higher in 2013 compared to 2012. As discussed elsewhere in this report, significant changes in oil and natural gas prices can have a material impact on our results of operations and our balance sheet, including the fair value of our derivatives. Source of Our Revenues We derive our revenues from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from our properties. Revenues are a function of the volume produced, the prevailing market price at the time of sale, oil quality, Btu content and transportation costs to market. We use derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a substantial, but varying, portion of our oil production. We expect our derivative activities will help us achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations. The use of derivative instruments has in the past, and may in the future, prevent us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements but also mitigates the effects of declining price movements. Our average realized price calculations include the effects of the settlement of all derivative contracts regardless of the accounting treatment. 36 Principal Components of Our Cost Structure · Oil price differentials. The price differential between our Williston Basin well head price and the NYMEX WTI benchmark price is driven by the additional cost to transport oil from the Williston Basin via train, barge, pipeline or truck to refineries. · (Loss) gain on the mark-to-market of derivative instruments. We utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil. This account activity represents the recognition of gains and losses associated with our outstanding derivative contracts as commodity prices and commodity derivative contracts change on contracts that have not been designated for hedge accounting. · Realized gain (loss) on derivative instruments. This account activity represents our realized gains and losses on the settlement of commodity derivative instruments. · Production expenses. Production expenses are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market, together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. Such costs also include field personnel compensation, salt water disposal, utilities, maintenance, repairs and servicing expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties. · Production taxes. Production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at market prices (not hedged prices) or at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. We seek to take full advantage of all credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions. In general, the production taxes we pay correlate to the changes in oil and natural gas revenues. · Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire, explore and develop oil and natural gas properties. As a full cost company, we capitalize all costs associated with our development and acquisition efforts and allocate these costs to each unit of production using the units-of-production method. · General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses include overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our acquisition and development operations, franchise taxes, audit and other professional fees and legal compliance. · Interest expense. We finance a portion of our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We capitalize a portion of the interest paid on applicable borrowings into our full cost pool. We include interest expense that is not capitalized into the full cost pool, the amortization of deferred financing costs and bond premiums (including origination and amendment fees), commitment fees and annual agency fees as interest expense. · Income tax expense. Our provision for taxes includes both federal and state taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. 37 Selected Factors That Affect Our Operating Results Our revenues, cash flows from operations and future growth depend substantially upon: · the timing and success of drilling and production activities by our operating partners; · the prices and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs; · the quantity of oil and natural gas production from the wells in which we participate; · changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments we use to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil; · our ability to continue to identify and acquire high-quality acreage; and · the level of our operating expenses. In addition to the factors that affect companies in our industry generally, the location of our acreage and wells in the Williston Basin subjects our operating results to factors specific to this region. These factors include the potential adverse impact of weather on drilling, production and transportation activities, particularly during the winter months, and the limitations of the developing infrastructure and transportation capacity in this region. The price of oil in the Williston Basin can vary depending on the market in which it is sold and the means of transportation used to transport the oil to market. Light sweet crude from the Williston Basin has a higher value at many major refining centers because of its higher quality relative to heavier and sour grades of oil; however, because of North Dakota’s location relative to traditional oil transport centers, this higher value is generally offset to some extent by higher transportation costs. While rail transportation has historically been more expensive than pipeline transportation, Williston Basin prices have been high enough to justify shipment by rail to markets, such as St. James, Louisiana, which offer prices benchmarked to Brent/LLS. Although pipeline, truck and rail capacity in the Williston Basin has historically lagged production in growth, we believe that additional planned infrastructure growth will help keep price discounts from significantly eroding wellhead values in the region. Over the past several years, oil production in the Williston Basin has increased dramatically. For example, North Dakota’s oil production in October 2013 was up approximately 93% as compared to October 2011. The surging oil production has created a huge need for oil takeaway infrastructure, which has struggled to keep pace with the growth in production. This caused the price of Bakken crude to lag significantly behind WTI crude at certain times over the last few years. In response to rapidly rising production, rail capacity out of the area has greatly expanded, which has allowed Bakken crude to reach refining markets on the East Coast, West Coast and Gulf Coast. As the takeaway solution developed, the Bakken crude differential to WTI in 2013 has lowered, and even traded at points at a premium to WTI. During the fourth quarter of 2013, our crude differential widened to approximately $14.98 per barrel due to several factors such as takeaway capacity lagging behind production, and seasonal refinery maintenance temporarily depressing crude demand. As the rail capacity continues to increase and planned pipeline expansions are completed, we believe the oil price differentials will return to historical levels. Our weighted average oil price differential to the NYMEX WTI benchmark price during 2013 was approximately $8.68 per barrel, as compared to $9.79 per barrel in 2012. Another significant factor affecting our operating results is drilling costs. The cost of drilling wells has increased significantly over the past few years as rising oil prices have triggered increased drilling activity in the Williston Basin. Although individual components of the cost can vary depending on numerous factors such as the length of the horizontal lateral, the number of fracture stimulation stages, and the choice of proppant (sand or ceramic), the total cost of drilling and completing an oil well has increased. This increase is largely due to longer horizontal laterals and more fracture stimulation stages, but also higher demand for rigs and completion services throughout the region. In addition, because of the rapid growth in drilling, the availability of well completion services has at times been constrained, resulting at times in a backlog of wells awaiting completion. 38 Market Conditions Prices for various quantities of oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Commodity prices have been volatile in recent years. The following tables list average NYMEX prices for oil and natural gas for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

(2) Realized prices include realized gains and losses on cash settlements for commodity derivatives. 39 Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Sales Our revenues vary from year to year primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes. In 2013, oil, natural gas and NGL sales increased 24% from 2012, driven primarily by a 19% increase in production and partially aided by a 5% increase in our average sales price per Boe in 2013 as compared to 2012. In 2012, oil, natural gas and NGL sales increased 86% from 2011 due to a 95% increase in production, partially offset by a 4% decrease in our average sales price per Boe in 2012 as compared to 2011. Our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells into production and through additions from acquisitions, partially offset by the natural decline of our production from existing wells. Our production primarily increased due to the addition of 40.0 and 48.3 net productive wells in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our production for each of the last three years is set forth in the following table: Year Ended 2013 2012 2011 Production Oil (Bbl) 4,046,701 3,465,311 1,791,979 Natural Gas and NGL (Mcf) 2,572,251 1,768,872 800,207 Total (Boe)(1) 4,475,409 3,760,123 1,925,347 Average Daily Production Oil (Bbl) 11,087 9,468 4,910 Natural Gas and NGL (Mcf) 7,047 4,833 2,192 Total (Boe)(1) 12,261 10,274 5,275 __________________________________ (1) Natural gas and NGLs are converted to Boe at the rate of one barrel equals six Mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil and natural gas, which is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil and natural gas prices. Derivative Instruments We enter into derivative instruments to manage the price risk attributable to future oil production. For 2013, we incurred a loss on settled derivatives of $12.2 million, compared to losses of $0.4 million in 2012 and $13.4 million in 2011. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements) received during 2013 was $79.77 per Boe compared to $78.79 per Boe in 2012 and $75.85 per Boe in 2011. Mark-to-market derivative gains and losses was a loss of $21.3 million in 2013 compared to a $15.1 million gain in 2012 and a $3.1 million loss in 2011. Our derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting and are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized immediately into earnings. Mark-to-market accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as gains and losses from unsettled derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying balance sheets. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Any gains on our derivatives will be offset by lower wellhead revenues in the future or any losses will be offset by higher future wellhead revenues based on the value at the settlement date. At December 31, 2013, all of our derivative contracts are recorded at their fair value, which was a net liability of $17.9 million, a decrease of $21.2 million from the $3.3 million net asset recorded as of December 31, 2012. Our open oil derivative contracts are summarized in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Commodity Price Risk.” 40 Production Expenses Production expenses were $41.9 million in 2013 compared to $32.4 million in 2012 and $13.0 million in 2011. We experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and maintain production from existing properties. On a per unit basis, production expenses increased from $8.61 per Boe in 2012 to $9.35 per Boe in 2013. On an absolute dollar basis, our production expenses in 2013 were 29% higher when compared to the same period in 2012 due primarily to a 19% increase in production levels and a 38% increase in the total number of net wells. Also contributing to the increase were increased water production and costs associated with more workover, repair and maintenance and salt water trucking and disposal activities during 2013 as compared to 2012. On a per unit basis, production expenses per Boe increased from $6.77 per barrel sold in 2011 to $8.61 in 2012. On an absolute dollar basis, our spending for production expenses for 2012 was 148% higher when compared to 2011 due to production levels increasing 95%, as well as higher water hauling and disposal costs and higher servicing expenses. Production Taxes We pay production taxes based on realized oil and natural gas sales. These costs were $35.0 million in 2013 compared to $28.5 million in 2012 and $14.3 million in 2011. Our average production tax rates were 9.5%, 9.6% and 9.0% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 2013 average production tax rate was lower than the 2012 average due to well additions that qualified for reduced rates/or tax exemptions during 2013. Certain portions of our production occurs in Montana and North Dakota jurisdictions that have lower initial tax rates for an established period of time or until an established threshold of production is exceeded, after which the tax rates are increased to the standard tax rate. The 2012 average production tax rate was higher than the 2011 average due to fewer well additions that qualified for reduced rates for tax exemptions during 2012. The majority of our production is located in North Dakota which imposes a standard 11.5% tax on our production revenues except for where properties qualify for reduced rates. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense was $16.6 million for 2013 compared to $22.6 million for 2012 and $13.6 million in 2011. The $6.0 million decrease in 2013 when compared to 2012 was primarily due to $5.5 million of severance charges recognized in 2012 in connection with the departures of our former president and our former chief operating officer. Additionally, salaries and benefit expenses decreased $1.5 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, which was partially offset by increased insurance ($0.6 million) and legal and professional ($0.2 million) expenses. Lower share based compensation in 2013 drove the year over year drop in salary and benefit expenses. The 2012 increase of $9.0 million when compared to 2011 is due to higher salary and benefit expenses ($3.6 million), increased travel expenses ($0.2 million) and partially offset by lower office and other administrative expenses ($0.3 million). Our personnel costs in 2012 as compared to 2011 continued to increase as we invested in our technical teams and other staffing to support our growth. Additionally, 2012 general and administrative expenses include $5.5 million of severance charges in connection with the departures of our former president and former chief operating officer. Depletion, Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion (“DD&A”) was $124.4 million in 2013 compared to $98.9 million in 2012 and $41.2 million in 2011. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A, was $27.62 per Boe in 2013 compared to $26.18 per Boe in 2012 and $21.20 per Boe in 2011. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year end reserve report and other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. The aggregate increase in depletion expense for 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by a 19% increase in production. Additionally, depletion rates rose in 2013 primarily due to higher production expenses and revised reserve estimates in certain of our areas of operation. Depletion rates in new plays tend to be higher in the beginning as increased initial outlays are amortized over proved reserves based on early stages of evaluations. As these plays mature, new technologies, well completion methodologies and additional historical operating information impact the reserve evaluations. The aggregate increase in depletion expense for 2012 compared to 2011 was driven by a 95% increase in production. Depreciation, amortization and accretion was $0.8 million in 2013 compared to $0.5 million in 2012 and $0.4 million in 2011. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per Boe for 2013, 2012 and 2011: 41 Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change Change 2012 2011 Change Change Depletion $ 27.62 $ 26.18 $ 1.44 6 % $ 26.18 $ 21.20 $ 4.98 23 % Depreciation, amortization, and accretion 0.17 0.13 0.04 31 % 0.13 0.18 (0.05 ) (28 )% Total DD&A expense $ 27.79 $ 26.31 $ 1.48 6 % $ 26.31 $ 21.38 $ 4.93 23 % Interest Expense Interest expense was $32.7 million for 2013 compared to $13.9 million in 2012. Interest expense was $13.9 million for 2012 compared to $0.6 million in 2011. In May 2013 and 2012, we issued $200 million and $300 million of 8% senior unsecured notes, respectively. The increase in interest expense for 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to different weighted average debt amounts outstanding between years. The increase in interest expense for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to different weighted average debt amounts outstanding between years, as well as the higher interest rate applicable to the senior notes. Interest Income Interest income was $21,000 for 2013 compared to $1,000 in 2012. Interest income was comparable between periods due to similar levels of cash and short term investments. Interest income was $1,000 for 2012 compared to $0.6 million in 2011. Interest income for 2012 decreased $0.6 million as compared to 2011 because of lower levels of cash and short term investments. In 2011, the higher amount of cash and short term investments resulted from proceeds from the sale of common stock in November 2010. Income Tax Provision The provision for income taxes was $31.8 million in 2013 compared to $43.0 million in 2012 and $26.8 million in 2011. The effective tax rate in 2013 was 37.4% compared to an effective tax rate of 37.3% in 2012. The effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state tax rates. The 2012 effective tax rate was 37.3% compared to an effective tax rate in 2011 of 39.8%. Due to higher pre-tax income levels, we increased our federal statutory rate from 34% to 35% in 2011. The effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state tax rates. Net Income Net income was $53.1 million in 2013 compared to $72.3 million in 2012 and $40.6 million in 2011. The increase in net income in 2012 as compared to 2011 was driven by higher production levels and higher average sales prices received in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease in net income in 2013 as compared to 2012 was driven by 2013 losses on settled derivatives and losses on the mark-to-market of derivative instruments of $12.2 million and $21.3 million, respectively. In 2012, our loss on settled derivatives was $0.4 million and our gain on the mark-to-market of derivative instruments was $15.1 million. Additionally, the higher oil and gas revenues in 2013 were partially offset by increased production expenses, production taxes, depletion expenses, and interest expense in 2013 compared to 2012. Our net income translated to diluted net income per common share of $0.85, $1.15 and $0.65 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 42 Non-GAAP Financial Measures We define Adjusted Net Income as net income excluding (i) loss (gain) on the mark-to-market of derivative instruments, net of tax and (ii) severance expenses in connection with the departures of our former president and former chief operating officer, net of tax. Our Adjusted Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2013, was $66.4 million (representing approximately $1.06 per diluted share), as compared to $66.2 million (representing approximately $1.05 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2012, and $38.8 million (representing approximately $0.62 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2011. These increases in Adjusted Net Income are primarily due to our continued addition of oil and natural gas production from new wells and higher realized commodity prices in 2013 compared to 2012 and in 2012 compared to 2011. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion, (iv) loss (gain) on the mark-to-market of derivative instruments and (v) non-cash share based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $268.0 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $225.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $112.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. These increases in Adjusted EBITDA are primarily due to our continued addition of oil and natural gas production from new wells and higher realized commodity prices in 2013 compared to 2012 and in 2012 compared to 2011. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors to gain an overall understanding of our current financial performance. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP financial measures included herein provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and unrealized commodity gains and losses that our management believes are not indicative of our core operating results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for budgeting and forecasting as well as subsequently measuring our performance, and we believe that we are providing investors with financial measures that most closely align to our internal measurement processes. We consider these non-GAAP measures to be useful in evaluating our core operating results as they more closely reflect our essential revenue generating activities and direct operating expenses (resulting in cash expenditures) needed to perform these revenue generating activities. Our management also believes, based on feedback provided by the investment community, that the non-GAAP financial measures are necessary to allow the investment community to construct its valuation models to better compare our results with our competitors and market sector. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Net income and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is included below: 43 NORTHERN OIL AND GAS, INC.

Our 2014 budget anticipates we will participate in the drilling and completion of approximately 44 net wells targeting the Bakken and Three Forks formations at an estimated cost of approximately $388 million. Based on evolving conditions in the field, we expect our spending to range between $30 million and $40 million on acreage and other expenditures during 2014. In addition, we estimate that we will spend approximately $12 million on other capital expenditure activities, primarily capitalized workover expenses. We have the ability to adjust capital expenditures by reducing the number of projects we elect to participate in. We currently expect to fund all 2014 commitments using a combination of cash-on-hand, cash flow generated by operations, bank borrowings and potential debt financings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Historically, our main sources of liquidity and capital resources have been internally generated cash flow from operations, credit facility borrowings and issuances of debt and equity. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use cash from operations to fund our development activities or reduce our bank debt. We continue to take steps to ensure adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In February 2012, we amended and restated the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) to increase the maximum facility size to $750 million, subject to a borrowing base that is currently $450 million. In May 2012, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount, and in May 2013, we issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of 8.000% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2020 (collectively the “Notes”). With our Revolving Credit Facility and our anticipated cash reserves and cash from operations, we believe that we will have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund our budgeted capital expenditures and operating expenses for at least the next twelve months. Any significant acquisition of additional properties or significant increase in drilling activity may require us to seek additional capital. We may also choose to seek additional financing from the capital markets rather than utilize our Revolving Credit Facility to fund such activities. We cannot assure you, however, that any additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. 45 At December 31, 2013, our debt to total capitalization ratio was 48%, we had $584.5 million of total debt outstanding, $619.8 million of stockholders’ equity, and $5.7 million of cash on hand. Additionally, at December 31, 2013, there was $375 million of availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2012, we had $424 million of debt outstanding, $586.2 million of stockholders’ equity, and $13.4 million of cash on hand. Cash Flows Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations also are impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to fund our development activities or reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We generally use derivatives to economically hedge a significant, but varying portion of our anticipated future oil production for the next 12 to 36 months. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts are funded by proceeds received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by cash from operations or borrowings under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2013, we had entered into derivative agreements covering 4.0 million barrels for 2014 and 2.9 million barrels for 2015, with average floor prices of $90.43 and $89.02, respectively. For additional information on the impact of changing prices on our financial position, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” Our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 222,774 $ 198,527 $ 85,150 Net cash used in investing activities (358,536 ) (532,172 ) (300,868 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 128,061 340,754 69,887 Net change in cash $ (7,701 ) $ 7,109 $ (145,831 ) Cash flows provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $222.8 million, $198.5 million and $85.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily the result of a 19% increase in oil and natural gas production that drove an oil and gas sales increase of 24%. Cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2012 increased compared to 2011 primarily as a result of an increase in oil and natural gas production of 95%. Cash flows used in investing activities We had cash flows used in investing activities of $358.5 million, $532.2 million and $300.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, primarily as a result of our capital expenditures for drilling, development and acquisition costs. Oil and gas expenditure spending decreased from $532.2 million in 2012 to $358.5 million in 2013, a 33% decrease that was driven by a decrease in the number of net producing well additions in 2013 as compared to 2012. In 2013, our net producing well additions totaled 40.0 as compared to 48.2 in 2012. Oil and gas expenditure spending increased from $341.4 million in 2011 to $532.0 million in 2012, a 56% increase that was driven by a 50% increase in the number of net producing well additions in 2012 as compared to 2011. In 2012, our net producing well additions totaled 48.3 as compared to 32.3 in 2011. The 2012 oil and gas expenditures include approximately $190.4 million for wells spud prior to 2012. The spending on wells spud prior to 2012 related to wells awaiting completion at December 31, 2011, as well as completion spending for wells placed into production prior to 2012. 46 Development and acquisition activities are highly discretionary. We monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting the amount up or down, and between projects, depending on projected commodity prices, cash flows and returns. Our capital expenditures for development and acquisition activities for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are summarized in the following table: Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (in millions) Drilling and completion costs $ 389.5 $ 486.0 $ 312.9 Acreage and other related activities 38.5 37.3 79.2 Other capital expenditures 11.1 14.2 21.9 Total $ 439.1 $ 537.5 $ 414.0 Cash flows provided by financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $128.1 million, $340.8 million and $69.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, cash sourced through financing activities was primarily provided from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and advances under our Revolving Credit Facility. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities for 2013 as compared to 2012 was attributable to a lower level of senior unsecured note issuance in 2013. Additionally, during 2013 we repurchased 2,036,383 shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $26.1 million and repaid $49 million of net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility with proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes. During 2012, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to $300 million from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and $54.1 million in net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2012. Our long term debt at December 31, 2013 was $584.5 million, which was comprised of $509.5 million in senior unsecured notes and $75 million of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2013 we had $375 million of available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash increases through financing activities was primarily provided by advances under our revolving credit facility. Revolving Credit Facility In February 2012, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement providing for a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced our previous revolving credit facility with a syndicated facility. Our bank group is comprised of a group of commercial banks, with no single bank holding more than 12% of the total facility. The Revolving Credit Facility, which is secured by substantially all of our assets, provides for a commitment equal to the lesser of the facility amount or the borrowing base. At December 31, 2013, the facility amount was $750 million, the borrowing base was $450 million and there was a $75 million outstanding balance, leaving $375 million of borrowing capacity available under the facility. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, we may issue an unlimited amount of permitted additional indebtedness, as defined, provided that the borrowing base will be reduced by 25% of the stated amount of any such permitted additional indebtedness. The $500 million in Notes described below is “permitted additional indebtedness” as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on September 30, 2018 and provides for a borrowing base subject to redetermination semi-annually each April and October and for event-driven unscheduled redeterminations. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility can either be at the Alternate Base Rate (as defined) plus a spread ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% or LIBOR borrowings at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (as defined) plus a spread ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%. The applicable spread at any time is dependent upon the amount of borrowings relative to the borrowing base at such time. We may elect, from time to time, to convert all or any part of our LIBOR loans to base rate loans or to convert all or any of the base rate loans to LIBOR loans. A commitment fee is paid on the undrawn balance based on an annual rate of either 0.375% or 0.50%. At December 31, 2013, the commitment fee was 0.375% and the interest rate margin was 1.5% on LIBOR loans and 0.5% on base rate loans. 47 The Revolving Credit Facility contains negative covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to pay any cash dividends, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, enter into certain hedging contracts, change the nature of our business or operations, merge, consolidate, or make investments. In addition, we are required to maintain a current ratio of no less than 1.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with our covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2013. All of our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in any and all of our assets. 8.000% Senior Notes due 2020 On May 18, 2012, we issued at par value $300 million aggregate principal amount of 8.000% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2020 (the “Original Notes”). On May 13, 2013, we issued at a price of 105.25% an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of 8.000% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2020 (the “Follow-on Notes” and, together with the Original Notes, the “Notes”). Interest is payable on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on each June 1 and December 1. The issuance of the Original Notes resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $291.2 million and the issuance of the Follow-on Notes resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $200.1 million, which are in use to fund our exploration, development and acquisition program and for general corporate purposes (including repayment of borrowings that were outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility at the time the Notes were issued). At any time prior to June 1, 2015, we may redeem up to 35% of the Notes at a redemption price of 108% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the proceeds of certain equity offerings so long as the redemption occurs within 180 days of completing such equity offering and at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding after such redemption. Prior to June 1, 2016, we may redeem some or all of the Notes for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus an applicable make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. On and after June 1, 2016, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to 104% for the twelve-month period beginning on June 1, 2016, 102% for the twelve-month period beginning June 1, 2017 and 100% beginning on June1, 2018, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The Notes are governed by an Indenture (the “Indenture”) dated May 18, 2012, with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Indenture restricts our ability to: (i) incur additional debt or enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (ii) pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase, equity interests; (iii) make certain investments; (iv) incur liens; (v) enter into transactions with affiliates; (vi) merge or consolidate with another company; and (vii) transfer and sell assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. If at any time when the Notes are rated investment grade by both Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and no Default (as defined in the Indenture) has occurred and is continuing, many of such covenants will terminate and we and any of our subsidiaries will cease to be subject to such covenants. The Indenture contains customary events of default, including: · default in any payment of interest on any Note when due, continued for 30 days; · default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any Note when due; · failure by us to comply with our other obligations under the Indenture, in certain cases subject to notice and grace periods; · payment defaults and accelerations with respect to our other indebtedness and certain of our subsidiaries, if any, in the aggregate principal amount of $25 million or more; · certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of our company or a significant subsidiary or group of restricted subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a significant subsidiary; · failure by us or any significant subsidiary or group of restricted subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a significant subsidiary to pay certain final judgments aggregating in excess of $25 million within 60 days; and · any guarantee of the Notes by a guarantor ceases to be in full force and effect, is declared null and void in a judicial proceeding or is denied or disaffirmed by its maker. 48 Capital Requirements Our primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and payment of interest on outstanding indebtedness. During 2013, our acreage and development expenditures included approximately $389.5 million of drilling, completion and capitalized workover costs, $1.8 million related to asset retirement obligations, $3.3 million of capitalized internal costs and $6.0 million of capitalized interest. Also in 2013, approximately $38.5 million was expended on acreage and other expenditures in the Williston Basin. Our 2013 capital program was funded by cash on hand, net cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. Our capital expenditure budget for 2014 is discussed above under the heading “2014 Operation Plan.” Development and acreage activities are highly discretionary, and, for the near term, we expect such activities to be maintained at levels we can fund through internal cash flow and borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility. To the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, debt may be issued to fund these requirements. We monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting the amount up or down and also between our projects, depending on commodity prices, cash flow and projected returns. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. Our future success in growing proved reserves and production may be dependent on our ability to access outside sources of capital. If internally generated cash flow and borrowing capacity is not available under our Revolving Credit Facility, we may issue additional shares of stock, subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, extend maturities or to repay debt. Satisfaction of Our Cash Obligations for the Next 12 Months With our Revolving Credit Facility and our cash flows from operations, we believe we have sufficient capital to meet our drilling commitments and expected general and administrative expenses for the next twelve months. Nonetheless, any strategic acquisition of assets or increase in drilling activity may require us to seek additional capital. We may also choose to seek additional capital rather than utilize our credit facility or other debt instruments to fund accelerated or continued drilling at the discretion of management and depending on prevailing market conditions. We will evaluate any potential opportunities for acquisitions as they arise. However, there can be no assurance that any additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. Over the next 24 months it is possible that our existing capital, our Revolving Credit Facility and anticipated funds from operations may not be sufficient to sustain continued acreage acquisitions and drilling activities. Consequently, we may seek additional capital in the future to fund growth and expansion through additional debt or equity financing or credit facilities. No assurance can be made that such financing would be available, and if available it may take either the form of debt or equity. In either case, the financing could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our shareholders. Effects of Inflation and Pricing The oil and natural gas industry is very cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies, suppliers and others associated with the industry put extreme pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry. Typically, as prices for oil and natural gas increase, so do all associated costs. Conversely, in a period of declining prices, associated cost declines are likely to lag and may not adjust downward in proportion. Material changes in prices also impact our current revenue stream, estimates of future reserves, borrowing base calculations of bank loans, impairment assessments of oil and natural gas properties, and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions. Material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and natural gas companies and their ability to raise capital, borrow money and retain personnel. While we do not currently expect business costs to materially increase, higher prices for oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials, services and personnel. 49 Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our obligations and commitments at December 31, 2013 to make future payments under certain contracts, aggregated by category of contractual obligation, for specified time periods: Payment due by Period Contractual Obligations Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Total Office Lease(1) $ 278,000 $ 177,000 $ - $ - $ 455,000 Automobile Leases(2) 27,000 - - - 27,000 Long Term Debt(3) - - 75,000,000 500,000,000 575,000,000 Cash Interest Expense on Debt(4) 41,253,000 82,505,000 82,192,000 56,667,000 262,617,000 Total $ 41,558,000 $ 82,682,000 $ 157,192,000 $ 556,667,000 $ 838,099,000 (1) Office lease through 2015 (2) Automobile leases for certain executives through 2014 (3) Revolving Credit Facility and 8.000% Senior Notes due 2020 (see Note 4 to financial statements) (4) Cash interest on Revolving Credit Facility and 8.000% Senior Notes due 2020 are estimated assuming no principal repayment until the due date The above contractual obligations schedule does not include future anticipated settlement of derivative contracts or estimated amounts expected to be incurred in the future associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties, as we cannot determine with accuracy the amount and/or timing of such payments. Critical Accounting Policies The establishment and consistent application of accounting policies is a vital component of accurately and fairly presenting our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), as well as ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing financial reporting. While there are rarely alternative methods or rules from which to select in establishing accounting and financial reporting policies, proper application often involves significant judgment regarding a given set of facts and circumstances and a complex series of decisions. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements under GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves, future development costs, estimates relating to certain oil and natural gas revenues and expenses and fair value of derivative instruments are the most critical to our financial statements. Oil and Natural Gas Reserves The determination of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense as well as impairments that are recognized on our oil and natural gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties. Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in the future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation, and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, production taxes and development costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as the prices of oil and natural gas and cost levels change from year to year, the economics of producing our reserves may change and therefore the estimate of proved reserves may also change. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. 50 The information regarding present value of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties. Thus, such information includes revisions of certain reserve estimates attributable to our properties included in the prior year’s estimates. These revisions reflect additional information from subsequent activities, production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices. Any future downward revisions could adversely affect our financial condition, our borrowing ability, our future prospects and the value of our common stock. The estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves used in the preparation of our financial statements were prepared by Ryder Scott Company, our registered independent petroleum consultants, and were prepared in accordance with the rules promulgated by the SEC. Oil and Natural Gas Properties The method of accounting we use to account for our oil and natural gas investments determines what costs are capitalized and how these costs are ultimately matched with revenues and expensed. We utilize the full cost method of accounting to account for our oil and natural gas investments instead of the successful efforts method because we believe it more accurately reflects the underlying economics of our programs to explore and develop oil and natural gas reserves. The full cost method embraces the concept that dry holes and other expenditures that fail to add reserves are intrinsic to the oil and natural gas exploration business. Thus, under the full cost method, all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized. These capitalized amounts include the costs of unproved properties, internal costs directly related to acquisitions, development and exploration activities, asset retirement costs, geological and geophysical costs that are directly attributable to the properties and capitalized interest. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, they are part of a program from which we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. The full cost method differs from the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas investments. The primary difference between these two methods is the treatment of exploratory dry hole costs. These costs are generally expensed under the successful efforts method when it is determined that measurable reserves do not exist. Geological and geophysical costs are also expensed under the successful efforts method. Under the full cost method, both dry hole costs and geological and geophysical costs are initially capitalized and classified as unproved properties pending determination of proved reserves. If no proved reserves are discovered, these costs are then amortized with all the costs in the full cost pool. Capitalized amounts except unproved costs are depleted using the units of production method. The depletion expense per unit of production is the ratio of the sum of our unamortized historical costs and estimated future development costs to our proved reserve volumes. Estimation of hydrocarbon reserves relies on professional judgment and use of factors that cannot be precisely determined. Subsequent reserve estimates materially different from those reported would change the depletion expense recognized during the future reporting periods. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our average depletion expense per unit of production was $27.62 per Boe. A 10% decrease in our estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2013 would result in a $0.94 per Boe increase in our per unit depletion. To the extent the capitalized costs in our full cost pool (net of depreciation, depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes) exceed the sum of the present value (using a 10% discount rate and based on period-end oil and natural gas prices) of the estimated future net cash flows from our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the capitalized cost associated with our unproved properties, we would have a capitalized ceiling impairment. Such costs would be charged to operations as a reduction of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed, even if the low prices are temporary. In addition, capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if we experience poor drilling results or estimations of our proved reserves are substantially reduced. A capitalized ceiling impairment is a reduction in earnings that does not impact cash flows, but does impact operating income and shareholders’ equity. Once recognized, a capitalized ceiling impairment charge to oil and natural gas properties cannot be reversed at a later date. The risk that we will experience a ceiling test writedown increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves. As of December 31, 2013 we have not incurred a capitalized ceiling impairment charge. However, no assurance can be given that we will not experience a capitalized ceiling impairment charge in future periods. In addition, capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if estimates of proved hydrocarbon reserves are substantially reduced or estimates of future development costs increase significantly.
