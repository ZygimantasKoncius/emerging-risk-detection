Item 1A. Risk Factors. Future results may be affected by risks and uncertainties including the following: We are currently being investigated by the SEC. We and Carey Financial, our wholly-owned broker-dealer subsidiary, are currently subject to an SEC investigation into payments made to third party broker-dealers in connection with the distribution of REITs managed by us and other matters. Although no regulatory action has been initiated against us or Carey Financial in connection with the matters being investigated, we expect that the SEC may pursue an action in the future. The potential timing of any such action and the nature of the relief or remedies the SEC may seek cannot be predicted at this time. If an action is brought, it could materially affect us. See Item 3  Legal Proceedings for a discussion of this investigation. The revenue streams from the investment advisory agreements with the CPA® REITs are subject to limitation or cancellation. The agreements under which we provide investment advisory services may generally be terminated by each CPA® REIT upon 60 days notice, with or without cause. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be terminated. A termination without cause may, however, entitle us to termination revenue, equal to 15% of the amount by which the net fair value of the relevant CPA® REITs assets exceeds the remaining amount necessary to provide investors with total distributions equal to their investment plus a preferred return. Nonetheless, any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in investor preferences or market conditions could limit our ability to raise funds or make new investments. Substantially all of our and the CPA® REITs current investments, as well as the majority of the investments we expect to originate for the CPA® REITs in 2007, are investments in single-tenant commercial properties that are subject to triple-net leases. In addition, we have relied predominantly on raising funds from individual investors through the sale by participating selected dealers to their customers of publicly-registered, non-traded securities of the CPA® REITs. Our recent fund raising efforts have been through one major selected dealer. Certain payments made to this selected dealer in connection with the distribution of our CPA® REIT offerings to investors are a subject of the SEC investigation described under Item 3-Legal Proceedings. If, as a result of changes in market receptivity to investments that are not readily liquid and involve high selected dealer fees, or for other reasons, this capital raising method were to become less available as a source of capital, our ability to raise funds for CPA® REIT programs, and consequently our ability to make investments on their behalf, could be adversely affected. While we are not limited to this particular method of raising funds for investment (and, among other things, the CPA® REITs may themselves be able to borrow additional funds to invest), our experience with other means of raising capital is limited. Also, many factors, including changes in tax laws or accounting rules, may make these types of investments less attractive to potential sellers and lessees, which could negatively affect our ability to increase the amount of assets of this type under management. Our management services operations exposes us to more volatility in earnings than our real estate investment business. Growth in revenue from our management services operations is dependent in large part on future capital raising in existing or future managed entities, as well as on our ability to make investments that meet the investment criteria of these entities, both of which are subject to uncertainty, including with respect to capital market and real estate market conditions. This uncertainty creates more volatility in our earnings because of the resulting increased volatility in transaction based revenue from our management services operations as compared to revenue from ownership of real estate subject to triple-net leases, which historically has been less volatile. Asset management revenue may be affected by factors that include not only our ability to increase the CPA® REITs portfolio of properties under management, but also changes in valuation of those properties, as well as sales (through planned liquidation or W. P. Carey 2006 10-K  13 Table of Contents otherwise) of CPA® REIT properties. In addition, revenue from our management services operations, including our ability to earn performance revenue, as well as the value of our holdings of CPA® REIT interests and dividend income from those interests, may be significantly affected by the results of operations of the CPA® REITs. Each of the CPA® REITs has invested substantially all of its assets (other than short-term investments) in triple-net leased properties substantially similar to those we hold, and consequently the results of operations of, and cash available for distribution by, each of the CPA® REITs, is likely to be substantially affected by the same market conditions, and subject to the same risk factors, as the properties we own. Four of the prior thirteen CPA® funds temporarily reduced the rate of distributions to their investors as a result of adverse developments involving tenants. Each of the CPA® REITs we currently advise and manage may also incur significant debt. This significant debt load could restrict their ability to pay revenue owed to us when due, due to either liquidity problems or restrictive covenants contained in their borrowing agreements. In addition, the revenue payable under each of our current investment advisory agreements is subject to a variable annual cap based on a formula tied to the assets and income of that CPA® REIT. This cap may limit the growth of our management revenue. Furthermore, our ability to earn revenue related to the disposition of properties is primarily tied to providing liquidity events for CPA® REIT investors. Our ability to provide that liquidity, and to do so under circumstances that will satisfy the applicable subordination requirements, will depend on market conditions at the relevant time, which may vary considerably over a period of years. In any case, liquidity events typically occur several years apart, and our management services operations income is likely to be significantly higher in those years in which such events occur. We face intense competition. In raising funds for investment by the CPA® REITs, we face competition from other funds with similar investment objectives that seek to raise funds from investors through publicly registered, non-traded funds, publicly-traded funds, or private funds. Any change in the attractiveness to investors of an investment in the type of property principally held by the CPA® REITs, relative to other types of investments, could adversely affect our ability to raise funds for future investments, which in turn could ultimately reduce, or limit the growth of, revenues from our management services operations. We also face competition for the acquisition of office and industrial properties in general, and such properties net leased to major corporations in particular, from many sources, including insurance companies, credit companies, pension funds, private individuals, financial institutions, finance companies and investment companies. We also face competition from institutions that provide or arrange for other types of commercial financing through private or public offerings of equity or debt or traditional bank financings. These institutions may accept greater risk or lower returns, allowing them to offer more attractive terms to prospective tenants. In addition, our evaluation of the acceptability of rates of return on behalf of the CPA® REITs is affected by such factors as the cost of raising capital, the amount of revenue we can earn and the performance hurdle rates of the relevant CPA® REITs. Thus, the effect of the cost of raising capital and the revenue we can earn may be to limit the amount of new investments we make on behalf of the CPA® REITs, which will in turn limit the growth of revenues from our management services operations. The inability of a tenant in a single tenant property to pay rent will reduce our revenues. Most of our properties are occupied by a single tenant and, therefore, the success of our investments is materially dependent on the financial stability of these tenants. Lease payment defaults by tenants negatively impact our net income and reduce the amounts available for distributions to shareholders. As our tenants generally may not have a recognized credit rating, they may have a higher risk of lease defaults than if our tenants had a recognized credit rating. In addition, the bankruptcy of a tenant could cause the loss of lease payments as well as an increase in the costs incurred to carry the property. We have had tenants file for bankruptcy protection and are involved in bankruptcy-related litigation. In the event of a default, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting the investment and re-leasing the property. If a lease is terminated, there is no assurance that we will be able to re-lease the property for the rent previously received or sell the property without incurring a loss. We depend on major tenants. Revenues from several of our tenants and/or their guarantors constitute a significant percentage of our lease revenues. Our five largest tenants/guarantors represented approximately 29% of total lease revenues in 2006, 28% in 2005 and 30% in 2004. The default, financial distress or bankruptcy of any of these tenants could cause interruptions in the receipt of lease revenues from these tenants and/or result in vacancies in the respective properties, which would reduce our revenues at least until the affected property is re-leased, and could decrease the ultimate sale value of each such property. A substantial amount of our leases will expire within the next five years. Within the next five years, approximately 55% of our leases are due to expire. If these leases are not renewed, or if the properties cannot be re-leased on terms that yield payments comparable to those currently being received, then our lease revenues could be substantially adversely affected. The terms of any new or renewed leases of these properties may depend on market conditions prevailing at the time of lease expiration. In addition, if properties are vacated by the current tenants, we may incur substantial costs in attempting to re-lease such properties. We may also seek to sell these properties, in which event we may incur losses, depending upon market conditions prevailing at the time of sale. W. P. Carey 2006 10-K  14 Table of Contents Our sale-leaseback agreements may permit tenants to purchase a property at a predetermined price, which could limit our realization of any appreciation or result in a loss. In some circumstances, we grant tenants a right to purchase the property they lease. The purchase price may be a fixed price or it may be based on a formula. If a tenant exercises its right to purchase the property and the propertys market value has increased beyond that price, we would be limited in fully realizing the appreciation on that property. Additionally, if the price at which the tenant can purchase the property is less than our purchase price or carrying value (for example, where the purchase price is based on an appraised value), we may incur a loss. We may recognize substantial impairment charges on our properties. Historically, we have incurred substantial impairment charges, which we are required to recognize whenever we sell a property for less than its carrying value, or we determine that the property has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in its carrying value (or, for direct financing leases, that the unguaranteed residual value of the underlying property has declined). For properties acquired in our 1998 consolidation with nine CPA® limited partnerships, their carrying value may reflect their appraised value at that time, rather than their original cost of acquisition by the CPA® limited partnership. By their nature, the timing or extent of impairment charges are not predictable. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which may reduce our net income, although it will not necessarily affect our cash flow from operations. Investments in properties outside of the United States subject us to foreign currency risks which may adversely affect distributions. We are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. We attempt to mitigate a portion of the risk of currency fluctuation by financing our properties in the local currencies. Changes in the relation of any such foreign currency to U.S. dollars may affect our revenues, operating margins and distributions and may also affect the book value of our assets and the amount of shareholders equity. Although we have not done so to date, we anticipate that in the future we may engage in direct hedging activities to mitigate the risks of exchange rate fluctuations. International investments involve additional risks. We have invested in and may continue to invest in properties located outside the United States. These investments may be affected by factors particular to the laws of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. These laws may expose us to risks that are different from and in addition to those commonly found in the United States, including:  Changing governmental rules and policies;  Enactment of laws relating to the foreign ownership of property and laws relating to the ability of foreign entities to remove profits earned from activities within the country to the United States;  Expropriation;  The difficulty in conforming obligations in other countries and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws;  Adverse market conditions caused by changes in national or local economic or political conditions;  Tax requirements vary by country and we may be subject to additional taxes as a result of our international investments;  Changes in relative interest rates;  Changes in the availability, cost and terms of mortgage funds resulting from varying national economic policies;  Changes in real estate and other tax rates and other operating expenses in particular countries;  Changes in land use and zoning laws; and  More stringent environmental laws or changes in such laws. In addition, the lack of available information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America could impair our ability to analyze transactions and may cause us to forego an investment opportunity. It may also impair our ability to receive timely and accurate financial information from tenants necessary to meet our reporting obligations to financial institutions or governmental or regulatory agencies. We may have difficulty re-leasing or selling our properties. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid compared to most financial assets and this illiquidity will limit our ability to quickly change our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. The net leases we may enter into or acquire may be for properties that are specially suited to the particular needs of the tenant. With these properties, if the current lease is terminated or not renewed, we may be required to renovate the property or to make rent concessions in order to lease the property to another tenant. In addition, if we are forced to sell the property, it may be difficult to sell to a party other than the tenant due to the special purpose for which the property may have been designed. These and other limitations, such as a propertys location and/or local economic conditions, may affect our ability to re-lease or sell properties without adversely affecting returns to shareholders. See Our Portfolio section above for scheduled lease expirations. W. P. Carey 2006 10-K  15 Table of Contents Our participation in joint ventures creates additional risk. We participate in joint ventures and invest in properties jointly with other entities, some of which may be unaffiliated with us. There are additional risks involved in these types of transactions. These risks include the potential of our joint venture partner becoming bankrupt and the possibility of diverging or inconsistent economic or business interests of our partner and us. These diverging interests could result in, among other things, exposing us to liabilities of the joint venture in excess of our proportionate share of these liabilities. The partition rights of each owner in a jointly owned property could reduce the value of each portion of the divided property. In addition, the fiduciary obligation that we may owe to our partner in an affiliated transaction may make it more difficult for us to enforce our rights. We do not fully control the management of our properties. The tenants or managers of net lease properties are responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management of the properties. If a property is not adequately maintained in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease, we may incur expenses for deferred maintenance expenditures or other liabilities once the property becomes free of the lease. While our leases generally provide for recourse against the tenant in these instances, a bankrupt or financially troubled tenant may be more likely to defer maintenance and it may be more difficult to enforce remedies against such a tenant. In addition, to the extent tenants are unable to conduct their operation of the property on a financially successful basis, their ability to pay rent may be adversely affected. Although we endeavor to monitor, on an ongoing basis, compliance by tenants with their lease obligations and other factors that could affect the financial performance of our properties, such monitoring may not in all circumstances ascertain or forestall deterioration either in the condition of a property or the financial circumstances of a tenant. We are subject to possible liabilities relating to environmental matters. We own commercial properties and are subject to the risk of liabilities under federal, state and local environmental laws. These responsibilities and liabilities also exist for properties owned by the CPA® REITs and if they become liable for these costs, their ability to pay for our services could be materially affected. Some of these laws could impose the following on us:  Responsibility and liability for the cost of investigation and removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on our property, generally without regard to our knowledge of or responsibility for the presence of the contaminants;  Liability for the costs of investigation and removal or remediation of hazardous substances at disposal facilities for persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of such substances;  Potential liability for common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs of environmental contaminants; and  Claims being made against us by the CPA® REITs for inadequate due diligence. Our costs of investigation, remediation or removal of hazardous or toxic substances, or for third-party claims for damages, may be substantial. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances at any of our properties, or the failure to properly remediate a contaminated property, could give rise to a lien in favor of the government for costs it may incur to address the contamination, or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral. While we will attempt to mitigate identified environmental risks by contractually requiring tenants to acknowledge their responsibility for complying with environmental laws and to assume liability for environmental matters, circumstances may arise in which a tenant fails, or is unable, to fulfill its contractual obligations. In addition, environmental liabilities, or costs or operating limitations imposed on a tenant to comply with environmental laws, could affect its ability to make rental payments to us. Also, and although we endeavor to avoid doing so, we may be required, in connection with any future divestitures of property, to provide buyers with indemnification against potential environmental liabilities. Our use of debt to finance investments could adversely affect our cash flow. Most of our investments are made by borrowing a portion of the total investment and securing the loan with a mortgage on the property. If we are unable to make our debt payments as required, a lender could foreclose on the property or properties securing its debt. This could cause us to lose part or all of our investment which in turn could cause the value of our portfolio, and revenues available for distribution to our shareholders to be reduced. We generally borrow on a limited recourse basis to limit our exposure on any property to the amount of equity invested in the property. There is no limitation on the amount which we can borrow on a single property. Some of our financing may also require us to make a lump-sum or balloon payment at maturity. Our ability to make balloon payments on debt will depend upon our ability either to refinance the obligation when due, invest additional equity in the property or to sell the related property. When the balloon payment is due, we may be unable to refinance the balloon payment on terms as favorable as the original loan or sell the property at a price sufficient to make the balloon payment. Our ability to accomplish these goals will be affected by various factors existing at the relevant time, such as the state of the national and regional economies, local real estate conditions, available mortgage rates, our equity in the mortgaged properties, our financial condition, the operating history W. P. Carey 2006 10-K  16 Table of Contents of the mortgaged properties and tax laws. A refinancing or sale could affect the rate of return to shareholders. Scheduled balloon payments for the next five years are as follows: 2007 $ 15,541 (1) 2008 $ 5,000 (2) 2009 $ 31,799 (3) 2010 $ 6,612 2011 $ 22,325 (3) (1) Does not include amounts that will be due upon maturity of our unsecured credit facility as these amounts are prepayable at any time. As of December 31, 2006, we had drawn $2,000 from this line of credit. (2) Does not include amounts that will be due upon maturity of our secured credit facility as these amounts are prepayable at any time. As of December 31, 2006 we had drawn $15,501 from this line of credit. (3) Excludes our pro rata share of mortgage obligations of equity investments in real estate totaling $2,173 in 2009 and $24,856 in 2011. We may be unable to make investments on an advantageous basis. A significant element of our business strategy is the enhancement of our portfolio and the CPA® REIT portfolios through new investments. The consummation of any future investment will be subject to satisfactory completion of our analysis and due diligence review and to the negotiation of definitive documentation. There can be no assurance that we or the CPA® REITs will be able to identify and invest in additional properties or will be able to finance investments in the future. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such investment, if consummated, will be profitable for us or the CPA® REITs. If we are unable to consummate new investments in the future on our own behalf or that of the CPA® REITs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the cash available for distribution to our shareholders, either through net income on investments we own or through net income generated by our management services operations. Our portfolio growth is constrained by our obligations to offer property transactions to the CPA® REITs. Under our investment advisory agreements with the CPA® REITs, we are required to use our best efforts to present a continuing and suitable investment program to them. In recent years, new property investment opportunities have generally been made available by us to the CPA® REITs. While the allocation of new investments to the CPA® REITs fulfills our duty to present a continuing and suitable investment program, and enhances the revenues from our management services operations, it also restricts the potential growth of revenues from our real estate operations. We may suffer uninsured losses. There are certain types of losses (such as due to wars or some natural disasters) that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of the limits of our insurance occur, we could lose capital invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from a property, while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the property. Any such loss would adversely affect our financial condition. Changes in market interest rates could cause our stock price to go down. The trading prices of equity securities issued by real estate companies have historically been affected by changes in broader market interest rates, with increases in interest rates resulting in decreases in trading prices, and decreases in interest rates resulting in increases in trading prices. An increase in market interest rates could therefore adversely affect the trading prices of any equity securities we issued. The stock price could also be affected by factors other than changes in interest rates, including the risk factors discussed herein. A potential change in United States accounting standards regarding operating leases may make the leasing of facilities less attractive to our potential domestic tenants, which could reduce overall demand for our leasing services. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 13, Accounting for Leases, a lease is classified by a tenant as a capital lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered to reside with the tenant. This situation is considered to be met if, among other things, the non-cancellable lease term is more than 75% of the useful life of the asset or if the present value of the minimum lease payments equals 90% or more of the leased propertys fair value. Under capital lease accounting for a tenant, both the leased asset and liability are reflected on their balance sheet. If the lease does not meet any of the criteria for a capital lease, the lease is considered an operating lease by the tenant, and the obligation does not appear on the tenants balance sheet; rather the contractual future minimum payment obligations are only disclosed in the footnotes thereto. Thus, entering into an operating lease can appear to W. P. Carey 2006 10-K  17 Table of Contents enhance a tenants balance sheet in comparison to direct ownership. In 2005, the SEC conducted a study of off-balance-sheet financing which, among other areas, included lease accounting. This study raised concerns that the current accounting model does not clearly portray the resources and obligations arising from long term lease transactions with sufficient transparency. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board announced a joint project to re-evaluate lease accounting. Changes to the accounting guidance could affect both our accounting for leases as well as that of our current and potential customers. These changes may affect how the real estate leasing business is conducted both domestically and internationally. For example, if the accounting standards regarding the financial statement classification of operating leases are revised, then companies may be less willing to enter into leases in general or desire to enter into leases with shorter terms because the apparent benefits to their balance sheets could be reduced or eliminated. This in turn could make it more difficult for us to enter leases on terms we find favorable. The value of our real estate is subject to fluctuation. We are subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real estate. While the revenues from our leases and those of the CPA® REITs are not directly dependent upon the value of the real estate owned, significant declines in real estate values could adversely affect us in many ways, including a decline in the residual values of properties at lease expiration; possible lease abandonments by tenants; a decline in the attractiveness of REIT investments that may impede our ability to raise new funds for investment by CPA® REITs and a decline in the attractiveness of triple-net lease transactions to potential sellers. We also face the risk that lease revenue will be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses and debt service payments on indebtedness we incur. General risks associated with the ownership of real estate include:  Adverse changes in general or local economic conditions,  Changes in the supply of or demand for similar or competing properties,  Changes in interest rates and operating expenses,  Competition for tenants,  Changes in market rental rates,  Inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases,  Renewal of leases at lower rental rates,  Inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy,  Changes in tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate,  Uninsured property liability, property damage or casualty losses,  Unexpected expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws, and  Acts of God and other factors beyond the control of our management. We depend on key personnel for our future success. We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of these executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our governing documents and capital structure may discourage a takeover. William P. Carey, Chairman, is the beneficial owner of approximately 26% of our outstanding shares. The provisions of our Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement and the share ownership of Mr. Carey may discourage a tender offer for our shares or a hostile takeover, even though these may be attractive to shareholders. Our business, results of operations, financial condition or our ability to pay distributions at the current rate could be materially adversely affected by the above conditions. The risk factors may have affected, and in the future could affect, our actual operating and financial results and could cause such results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements. You should not consider this list exhaustive. New risk factors emerge periodically, and we cannot completely assure you that the factors described above list all material risks to us at any specific point in time. We have disclosed many of the important risk factors discussed above in our previous filings with the SEC. W. P. Carey 2006 10-K  18 Table of Contents Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.
