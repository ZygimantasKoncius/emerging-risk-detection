ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see Forward-Looking Statements, HEIs MD&A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, HEIs Consolidated Financial Statements, HECOs MD&A and HECOs Consolidated Financial Statements. Holding Company and Company-Wide Risks HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital. HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEIs cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEIs subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI is, in turn, subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:  the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEIs principal electric public utility subsidiary, HECO, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the electric public utility subsidiaries falls below 35% of total electric utility capitalization;  the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which require HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2006) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASBs regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;  the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OTS that are applicable to ASB;  the receipt of a letter from the OTS stating it has no objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to HEI; and  the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries. The Company is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy, volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate environment that could result in higher retirement benefits expenses, declines in electric utility kilowatthour sales, declines in ASBs interest rate margins, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASBs loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money. The two largest components of Hawaiis economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEIs subsidiaries are providing local electric public utility services (through HECO and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB and its subsidiaries) in Hawaii, the Companys operating results are significantly influenced by Hawaiis economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism, by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of world conditions (e.g., war in Iraq) on federal government spending in Hawaii. A decline in the Hawaii economy, or the U.S. or Asian economies, could lead to a decline in KWH sales and an increase in uncollected billings of HECO and its subsidiaries, higher delinquencies in ASBs loan portfolio and other adverse effects on HEIs businesses. If S&P or Moodys were to downgrade HEIs or HECOs long-term debt ratings because of these adverse effects, or if future events were to adversely affect the availability of capital to the Company, HEIs and HECOs ability to borrow could be constrained and their future borrowing costs would likely increase with resulting reductions in HEIs consolidated net income in future periods. Further, if HEIs or HECOs ratings were to be downgraded, HEI and HECO might not be able to sell commercial paper under current market conditions and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures. 33 Table of Contents Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension expense is affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to determine the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost. Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASBs operations. HEI and its electric utility subsidiaries are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine retirement benefits expenses and obligations and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk. HEI and HECO and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to recognize substantial liabilities for retirement benefits. Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. Retirement benefits expenses based on net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs have been an allowable expense for rate-making, and higher retirement benefits expenses, along with other factors, may affect each electric utilities need to request a rate increase. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R), which requires employers to recognize on their balance sheets the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans with an offset to AOCI in stockholders equity (using the projected benefit obligation, rather than the accumulated benefit obligation, to calculate the funded status of pension plans). The amounts recorded in the future will be dependent on numerous factors, including the year-end discount rate assumption, asset returns experienced, any changes to actuarial assumptions or plan provisions, contributions made by the Company to the plans, and what action the PUC takes in rate cases. By application filed on December 8, 2005 (AOCI Docket), the electric utilities had requested the PUC to permit them to record, as a regulatory asset the amount that would otherwise be charged against stockholders equity as a result of recording a minimum pension liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. The electric utilities updated their application in the AOCI Docket in November 2006 to take into account SFAS No. 158. On January 26, 2007, the PUC issued a D&O in the updated AOCI docket, which denied the electric utilities request to record a regulatory asset. Although there was not an immediate impact on net income due to this D&O, the electric utilities (as well as HEI) were required to record substantial charges against stockholders equity, and the electric utilities reported returns on rate base and returns on average common equity will be higher than if there had been no charge against stockholders equity. Consolidated debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios of the Company and the electric utilities were also adversely affected. These effects could adversely affect security ratings, and increase the difficulty or expense of obtaining future financing. The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the electric utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB. The business of HECO and its electric utility subsidiaries is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. The operations of HEIs electric utility subsidiaries are more vulnerable to service interruptions than are many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of HECO and its subsidiaries are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. The peak reserve margins on Oahu are currently below desirable levels and this condition will likely continue and be exacerbated by projected load growth until additional generation is brought on line, which is not expected until 2009. Service interruptions, including in particular extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the KWH sales of some or all of the electric utility 34 Table of Contents subsidiaries. For example, on October 15, 2006, two sequential earthquakes registering 6.7 and 6.0 on the Richter scale with an epicenter near the island of Hawaii triggered power outages throughout most of the state, and although power was restored to over 99% of Oahu customers over a period of time ranging from 4 1/2 to 18 hours, some areas were without power for more than 24 hours. Substantially all of ASBs consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are located in Hawaii. Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASBs residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with other geographic concentrations in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and the ability of ASBs customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans. Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEIs businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete. The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEIs subsidiaries in meeting competition will continue to have a direct impact on HEIs consolidated financial performance. For example:  ASB, which is the third largest financial institution in the state based on total assets, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASBs ability to compete effectively. Significant advances in technology could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete.  HECO and its subsidiaries face competition from IPPs, including alternate energy providers, and customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration. The PUC issued a decision in its investigative proceeding on competitive bidding as a mechanism for acquiring or building new electric generating capacity. With the exception of certain identified projects, the utilities are now required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC issued a decision in its distributed generation (DG) investigative proceeding, in which it set policies for DG interconnection agreements and standby rates, and established conditions under which electric utilities can provide DG services on customer-owned sites as a regulated service. The electric utilities cannot predict the ultimate effect of the PUCs decisions in the competitive bidding and DG proceedings, the impact they will have on competition from IPPs and customer self-generation, or the rate at which technological developments facilitating non-utility generation of electricity will occur.  New technological developments, such as the commercial development of fuel cells, may render the operations of HEIs electric utility subsidiaries less competitive or outdated. HEIs businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have. In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third-parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Certain of the insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. For example: The electric utilities overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents) have an estimated replacement cost of approximately $3.5 billion and are not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance available is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the electric utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC were not to allow the affected electric utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could 35 Table of Contents result in a significant decrease in HEIs consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods. ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies and special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance. Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal and state environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances. Compliance with these legal requirements requires HEIs utility subsidiaries to commit significant resources and funds toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines. At the present time, HECO is a named party in an ongoing environmental investigation to determine the nature and extent of actual or potential release of hazardous substances, oil, pollutants or contaminants at or near Honolulu Harbor and management cannot predict the ultimate cost or outcome of that investigation. Adverse tax rulings or developments could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense. Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and, if the taxing authorities prevail, HEIs consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly. Further, the ability of HEI and its subsidiaries to generate capital gains and utilize capital loss carryforwards on future tax returns could impact future earnings. The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters. HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEIs consolidated financial statements. Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Companys assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses. HEIs consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Changes in these principles, such as the changes related to the accounting for retirement benefits in SFAS No. 158, or the Companys application of existing accounting principles could materially affect HEIs or the electric utilities consolidated financial position and/or results of operations. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for investment and mortgage-related securities; property, plant and equipment; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; contingencies and litigation; income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; electric utility revenues; variable interest entities; and allowance for loan losses. In accordance with SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, HECO and its subsidiaries financial statements reflect assets and costs based on cost-based rate-making regulations. Continued 36 Table of Contents accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met. If events or circumstances should change so that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the electric utilities regulatory assets (amounting to approximately $112 million as of December 31, 2006) may need to be charged to expense, which could result in significant reductions in the electric utilities net income, and the electric utilities regulatory liabilities (amounting to $241 million as of December 31, 2006) may need to be refunded to ratepayers. Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEIs consolidated financial statements. For example, if a PPA falls within the scope of FASB FIN No. 46 (FIN 46R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities and results in the consolidation of the IPP in HECOs consolidated financial statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on HECOs consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities, and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses. Also, if a PPA falls within the scope of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 01-8, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease and results in the classification of the agreement as a capital lease, a material effect on HEIs consolidated balance sheet may result, including the recognition of significant capital assets and lease obligations. Electric Utility Risks Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the electric utility subsidiaries and could result in inadequate or untimely rate relief, in rate reductions or refunds or in unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects. The rates the electric utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the electric utilities financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the electric utilities charge their customers. HECO currently has a rate case based on a 2005 test year pending before the PUC. Near the end of September 2005, HECO received an interim D&O (granting $53 million in annual base revenues) and is awaiting a final D&O. In May 2006, HELCO filed a request for a rate increase based on a 2006 test year intended largely to recover the cost of improvements to its transmission and distribution lines and the two generating units at its Keahole generating plant (CT-4 and CT-5). In December 2006, HECO filed a request for general rate increases based on a 2007 test year intended largely to recover costs incurred to maintain and improve reliability. In February 2007, MECO filed a request for general rate increase also based on a 2007 test year intended largely to recover costs incurred for the installation of Maalaea Unit M18 as well as to maintain service quality, fulfill infrastructure needs, and maintain financial integrity. The trend of increased operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses (including increased retirement benefits expenses), which management expects will continue, increased plant-in-service and other factors are likely to result in the electric utilities seeking rate relief more often than in the past. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding, could have a material adverse effect on HECOs consolidated financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. The electric utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues received under interim rate orders if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final rate orders. As of December 31, 2006, the electric utilities had recognized an aggregate of $79 million of such revenues with respect to interim orders regarding certain IRP costs and the interim order in the HECO rate case based on a 2005 test year. Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. For example, two major capital improvement projects  HECOs East Oahu Transmission Project and the expansion of HELCOs Keahole generating plant  have encountered substantial opposition and consequent delay and increased cost. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of the project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in HECOs consolidated net income. 37 Table of Contents Energy cost adjustment clauses (ECACs). The rate schedules of each of HEIs electric utilities include ECACs under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power. In 2004 PUC decisions approving the electric utilities fuel supply contracts, the PUC affirmed the electric utilities right to include in their respective ECACs the stated costs incurred pursuant to their respective new fuel supply contracts, to the extent that these costs are not included in their respective base rates, and restated its intention to examine the need for continued use of ECACs in rate cases. On June 19, 2006, the PUC issued an order in HECOs pending rate case based on a 2005 test year, indicating that the record in the pending case has not been developed for the purpose of addressing the factors in Act 162, signed into law by the Governor of Hawaii on June 2, 2006. Act 162 states that any automatic fuel rate adjustment clause requested by a public utility in an application filed with the PUC shall be designed, as determined in the PUCs discretion, to (1) fairly share the risk of fuel cost changes between the public utility and its customers, (2) provide the public utility with sufficient incentive to reasonably manage or lower its fuel costs and encourage greater use of renewable energy, (3) allow the public utility to mitigate the risk of sudden or frequent fuel cost changes that cannot otherwise reasonably be mitigated through other commercially available means, such as through fuel hedging contracts, (4) preserve, to the extent reasonably possible, the public utilitys financial integrity, and (5) minimize, to the extent reasonably possible, the public utilitys need to file frequent applications for general rate increases to account for the changes to its fuel costs. While the PUC already reviews the automatic fuel rate adjustment clause in rate cases, Act 162 requires that these five specific factors be addressed in the record. The PUCs order requested the parties in the rate case proceeding to meet informally to determine a procedural schedule to address the issues relating to HECOs ECAC that are raised by Act 162. On June 30, 2006, HECO and the Division of Consumer Advocacy, Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs of the State of Hawaii (Consumer Advocate) filed a stipulation requesting that the PUC not review the Act 162 ECAC issues in the pending rate case based on a 2005 test year since HECOs application was filed and the record in the proceeding was completed before Act 162 was signed into law, and the settlement agreement entered into by the parties in the rate case included a provision allowing the existing ECAC to be continued. On August 7, 2006, an amended stipulation was filed in substantially the same form as the June 30, 2006 stipulation, but also included the Department of Defense (DOD). Management cannot predict whether the PUC will accept the disposition of the Act 162 issue proposed in the amended stipulation or, if not, the procedural steps or procedural schedule that will be adopted to address the issues that are raised by Act 162 or the timing of the PUCs issuance of a final D&O in HECOs pending rate case based on a 2005 test year. In December 2006, HECO (in its 2007 test year rate case) and HELCO (in its 2006 test year rate case) filed testimonies and a consultant report to address the ECAC provisions of Act 162. In February 2007, MECO filed its 2007 test year rate case application, which included testimony to address the ECAC provisions of Act 162. The testimonies and consultant report concluded that the utilities current ECACs comply with the requirements of Act 162. Management cannot predict the ultimate outcome or the effect of these Act 162 issues on the operation of the ECAC as it relates to the electric utilities. Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions. The electric utilities results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis, can be destructive, causing outages and property damage and requiring the utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable. 38 Table of Contents Electric utility operations depend heavily on third party suppliers of fuel oil and purchased power. The electric utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and shippers and independent power producers to deliver fuel oil and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 78.9% of the net energy generated or purchased by the electric utilities in 2006 was generated from the burning of oil, and purchases of power by the electric utilities provided about 38.2% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the electric utilities to deliver electricity and require the electric utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as these contractual agreements end, the electric utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements. Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs. Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the electric utilities generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems. For example, as a result of load growth on Oahu and other factors, there currently is an increased risk to generation reliability. Generation peak reserve margins are lower than considered desirable in light of circumstances. Existing units are running harder, resulting in more frequent and more extensive maintenance, at times requiring temporary shut downs of these units. HECO has taken a number of steps to mitigate the risk of outages, including securing additional purchased power, adding distributed generation at some substations and encouraging energy conservation. The marginal costs of supplying energy to meet growing demand, however, are increasing because of the decreasing peak reserve margin situation, and the trend of cost increases is not likely to ease. The electric utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation. Congress and the Hawaii Legislature periodically consider legislation that could have positive or negative effects on the electric utilities and their customers. For example, Congress adopted the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which will provide $14.5 billion in tax incentives over a 10-year period designed to boost conservation efforts, increase domestic energy production and expand the use of alternative energy sources, such as solar, wind, ethanol, biomass, hydropower and clean coal technology. The incentives include tax credits and shorter depreciable lives for many assets associated with energy production and transmission. The primary impact of these incentives on the electric utilities will be the reduction in the depreciable tax life, from 20 years to 15 years, of certain electric transmission equipment placed into service after April 11, 2005. In addition to the ECAC provisions of Act 162 discussed above, the Hawaii Legislature adopted a number of measures in 2006, which may affect the electric utilities, as described below. Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) law. The 2004 Hawaii Legislature amended an existing RPS law to require electric utilities to meet a RPS of 8% of KWH sales by December 31, 2005, 10% by December 31, 2010, 15% by December 31, 2015, and 20% by December 31, 2020. These standards may be met by the electric utilities on an aggregated basis and were met in 2005 when they attained a RPS of 11.7%. It may be difficult, however, for the electric utilities to attain the required renewables percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be established by the PUC). DSM programs. In 2006, the PUC was given the authority, if it deems appropriate, to redirect all or a portion of the funds currently collected by the utilities and included in their revenues through the current utility demand-side management (DSM) surcharge into a Public Benefits Fund, for the purpose of supporting customer DSM programs approved by the PUC. 39 Table of Contents Non-fossil fuel purchased power contracts. In 2006, a law was passed that requires the PUC, in connection with its determination of just and reasonable rates in purchased power contracts, to establish a methodology that removes or significantly reduces any linkage between the price paid for non-fossil-fuel-generated electricity under future power purchase contracts and the price of fossil fuel, in order to allow utility customers to receive the potential cost savings from non-fossil fuel generation. Net energy metering. Hawaii has a net energy metering law, which requires that electric utilities offer net energy metering to eligible customer generators (i.e., a customer generator may be a net user or supplier of energy and will make payment to or receive credit from the electric utility accordingly). The law provides a cap of 0.5% of the electric utilitys peak demand on the total generating capacity produced by eligible customer-generators. The 2004 Legislature amended the net energy metering law by expanding the definition of eligible customer generator to include government entities, increasing the maximum size of eligible net metered systems from 10 kilowatts (kw) to 50 kw and limiting exemptions from additional requirements for systems meeting safety and performance standards to systems of 10 kw or less. In 2005, the Legislature amended the net energy metering law by, among other revisions, authorizing the PUC, by rule or order, to increase the maximum size of the eligible net metered systems and to increase the total rated generating capacity available for net energy metering. In April 2006, the PUC initiated an investigative proceeding on whether the PUC should increase (1) the maximum capacity of eligible customer-generators to more than 50 kw and (2) the total rated generating capacity produced by eligible customer-generators to an amount above 0.5% of an electric utilitys system peak demand. The parties to the proceeding include HECO, HELCO, MECO, Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, a renewable energy organization and a solar vendor organization. The PUC has approved a procedural schedule with panel hearings scheduled for October 2007. Depending on their magnitude, changes made by the PUC by rule or order could have a negative effect on electric utility sales. Management cannot predict the outcome of the investigative proceeding. Bank Risks Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASBs ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASBs adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments. Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASBs operations. ASBs net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-related securities and investments and interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates or between different interest rate indices, can impact ASBs net interest margin. Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASBs cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASBs ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, could also adversely affect the ability of ASBs adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities and impact ASBs ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets. 40 Table of Contents ASBs operations are affected by many disparate factors, some of which are beyond its control, that could result in lower net interest income or decreased demand for its products and services. ASBs results of operations depend primarily on the level of net interest income generated by ASBs earning assets and costing liabilities and the supply of and demand for its products and services (i.e., loans and deposits). ASBs net income may also be adversely affected by various other factors, such as:  local and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;  the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;  faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing rights of ASB;  changes in ASBs loan portfolio credit profile and asset quality which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for loan losses;  increases in operating costs, due to its strategic transformation to a full-service community bank, inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB s net interest, fee and other income;  the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASBs lowest cost funds; and  the ability of ASB to execute its strategy to transform itself to a full-service community bank. Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASBs business. ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OTS and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. As ASBs primary regulator, the OTS regularly conducts examinations to assess the safety and soundness of ASBs operations and activities and ASBs compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations. Because ASB is an indirect subsidiary of HEI, federal regulatory authorities have the right to examine HEI and its activities. Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASBs relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its stockholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OTS under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASBs capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in qualified thrift investments. Savings associations that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASBs case, the activities of HEI and HEIs other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the entities that could acquire ASB. ASBs strategy to expand its commercial and commercial real estate lending activities may result in higher service costs and greater credit risk than residential lending activities due to the unique characteristics of these markets. ASB has been aggressively pursuing a strategy that includes expanding its commercial and commercial real estate lines of business. These types of loans generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages. Generally, both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms to maturity and earn higher rates than residential mortgage loans. Only the assets of the business typically secure commercial loans. In such cases, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments. Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they may have a significant principal balance or balloon payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly 41 Table of Contents industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under the terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, tenants may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of such tenants lease. In addition to the inherent risks of commercial and commercial real estate lending described above, the expansion of these new lines of business present execution risks including the ability of ASB to attract personnel experienced in underwriting such loans and the ability of ASB to appropriately evaluate credit risk associated with such loans in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
