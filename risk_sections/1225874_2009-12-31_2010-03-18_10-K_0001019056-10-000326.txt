Risk Factors Bank lending is an inherently risky business. A substantial portion of our assets are invested in loans, and loans necessarily present many risks. We must first rely on our borrowers to repay their loans, and if they are unable to do so, we must rely on the value of the collateral, if any, for the loan. Changing business conditions, increases in unemployment, personal problems that a borrower may experience, changes in the regulations that apply to a borrower’s business, changes in the political climate or in public policy, and many other factors outside our control, could adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans or the value of the col lateral we have received. Although we seek to reduce these risks through underwriting procedures that we believe are prudent, it is impossible for us to completely eliminate the risks which arise from making loans except by eliminating our lending operations. The current turmoil in the economy in general and among financial institutions in particular could adversely affect our customers and thus have an indirect adverse effect on us. The economy in the United States, including the economy in Staten Island, was, and may still be, in a recession. There is substantial stress on many financial institutions and financial products. The federal government has intervened by making hundreds of billions of dollars in capital contributions to the banking industry. We draw a substantial portion of our customer base from local businesses, especially those in the building trades and related industries. Some of our customers have been adversely aff ected by the economic downturn, and if the recession continues, or the recovery is slow, it will become more difficult for us to conduct prudent and profitable business in our community. Making permanent residential mortgage loans is not a material part of our business, and our investments in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations have been made with a view towards avoiding the types of securities that are backed by low quality mortgage-related assets. However, one of the primary focuses of our local business is receiving deposits from, and making loans to, businesses involved in the construction and building trades industry on Staten Island. Construction loans represented a significant component of our loan portfolio, reaching 39.8% of total loans at year end 2005. As we monitored the economy and the strength of the local construction industry, we elected to reduce our portfolio of construction loans, which totaled 16.8% of total loans at December 31, 2009. However, developers and builders pro vide not only a source of loans, but they also provide us with deposits and other business. If the weakness in the economy continues or worsens, then that could have a substantial adverse effect on our customers and potential customers, making it more difficult for us to find satisfactory loan opportunities and low-cost deposits. This could compel us to invest in lower yielding securities instead of higher-yielding loans and could also reduce low cost funding sources such as checking accounts and require that we replace them with higher cost deposits such as time deposits. Either or both of those shifts could reduce our net income. Fluctuations in interest rates could have an adverse affect on our profitability. Our principal source of income is the difference between the interest income we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and our cost of funds, principally interest paid on deposits. These rates of interest change from time to time, depending upon a number of factors, including general market interest rates. However, the frequency of the changes varies among different types of assets and liabilities. For example, for a five-year loan with an interest rate based upon the prime rate, the interest rate may change every time the prime rate changes. In contrast, the rate of interest we pay on a five-year certificate of deposit adjusts only every five years, based upon changes in market interest rates. In general, the interest rates we pay on deposits adjust more slowly than the interest rates we earn on loans because our loan portfolio consists primarily of loans with interest rates that fluctuate based upon the prime rate. In contrast, although many of our deposit categories have interest rates that could adjust immediately, such as interest checking accounts and savings accounts, changes in the interest rates on those accounts are at our discretion. Thus, the rates on those accounts, as well as the rates we pay on certificates of deposit, tend to adjust more slowly. As a result, the declines in market interest rates that occurred through the end of 2008 initially had an adverse effect on our net income because the yields we earn on our loans declined more rapidly than our co st of funds. However, many of our prime-based loans had minimum interest rates, or floors, below which the interest rate does not decline despite further decreases in the prime rate. As our loans reached their interest rate floors, our loan yields stabilized while our deposit costs continued to decline. This had a positive effect on our net interest income. When market interest rates begin increasing, which we expect will occur at some point in the future, we anticipate an initial adverse effect on our net income. We anticipate that this will occur because our deposit rates should begin to rise while loan yields remain relatively steady until the prime rate increases sufficiently that our loans begin to reprice above their interest rate floors. Once our loan rates exceed the interest rate floors, increases in market interest rates should increase our net interest income because our cost of deposits should probably increase more slowly than the yields on our loans. However, cu stomer preferences and competitive pressures may negate this positive effect because customers may choose to move funds into higher-earning deposit types as higher interest rates make them more attractive, or competitors offer premium rates to attract deposits. We also have a substantial portfolio of investment securities with fixed rates of interest, most of which are mortgage-backed securities with an estimated average life of not more than 5 years. 5 The limited trading market for our common stock may make it difficult for stockholders to sell their stock for full value. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, which listing was effective on August 4, 2008. We continue to trade under the symbol “VSBN.” We are listed on the Global Market in the hope that it would increase the trading market in our stock and make it easier for individuals to buy and sell our stock. However, our stock does not trade every day and the average daily trading volume is limited. During the twelve months ended February 26, 2010, there were trades reported on only 91 out of 251 trading days, or slightly more than one out of every three trading days, and our average daily trading volume during that period was 928 shares for all trading days and 2,560 shares per day for the 91 days on which trades occurred. During the twelve months ended February 26, 2010, 43.2% of all reported trading volume represented stock repurchases by us pursuant to our announced stock repurchase programs. We currently have approximately 149 stockholders of record and we believe based upon reports we have received from broker/dealers, that there are approximately an additional 250 stockholders who own their shares in street name. The geographic concentration of our loans increases the risk that adverse economic conditions could affect our net income. Substantially all of our loans are mortgage loans on property located in Staten Island, New York, or loans to residents of or businesses on Staten Island. Staten Island has experienced an economic down turn in recent years. In addition, due to the importance of the home building trade on Staten Island, the recent adverse conditions in the residential real estate market has had an additional negative impact on many local businesses that make up our core customer base. A continued economic slow-down or decline in the local economy could h ave an adverse effect on us for a number of reasons. Adverse economic conditions could hurt the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. If real estate values decline, reductions in the value of real estate collateral could make it more difficult for us to recover the full amount due on loans which go into default. Furthermore, economic difficulties can also increase deposit outflows as customers must use savings to pay bills. This could increase our cost of funds because of the need to replace the deposit outflow. All of these factors might combine to reduce significantly our net income. Adverse financial results of other financial institutions could adversely affect our net income or our reputation. In the past two years, there have been many failures and near-failures among financial institutions. The number of FDIC-insured banks that have failed has increased, and the FDIC insurance fund reserve ratio, representing the ratio of the fund to the level of insured deposits, has declined due to losses caused by bank failures. As a result, the FDIC has increased its deposit insurance premiums on remaining institutions, including well-capitalized institutions like Victory State Bank, in order to replenish the insurance fund. If bank failures continue to o ccur, and more so if the level of failures increases, the FDIC insurance fund will further decline, and the FDIC may impose higher premiums on healthy banks. Thus, despite the prudent steps we may take to avoid the mistakes made by other banks, our costs of operations may increase as a result of those mistakes by others. Furthermore, the public perception of banks in general may decline due to the failures of other banks, which could cause some of our customers to reduce or terminate their business with us. Our FDIC insurance premium was $369,965 in 2009. In 2009, the FDIC announced an increase in deposit insurance premiums so institutions like our Bank, even though we pay premiums in the lowest premium category, will be subject to an assessment rate between seven (7) and twelve (12) basis points per annum. This is higher than the lowest assessment rate in 2008 of from five (5) to seven (7) basis points. Additionally, the FDIC imposed a 5 basis point special assessment, based on June 30, 2009 total assets net of Tier 1 capital, that we paid on September 30, 2009. The special assessment amounted to $101,950 and we accrued it prior to the quarter in which it was paid b ecause it was based upon assets at June 30. The increase in the assessment rate and the special assessment significantly increased our deposit insurance expense in 2009. The FDIC also required that FDIC-insured banks prepay, by the end of 2009, their entire projected FDIC premium assessment through the end of 2012. The prepaid amount will be expensed for financial reporting purposes gradually each quarter during the prepayment period. If our actual FDIC assessment during that period is less than the amount we prepay, the excess prepayment will be applied to future premiums we owe, and any excess prepayment remaining on December 31, 2014 would be refunded to us. Although the prepayment had no direct income statement effect when made, it reduced the funds we have available for investment in interest-earning assets because the FDIC will not pay interest on the prepayment. At December 31, 2009, we prepaid $1,025,945 to satisfy this requirement. 6 Changes in the federal or state regulation of financial institutions could have an adverse effect on future operations. Federal and New York State banking laws and regulations have a substantial, regular and every-day effect on our business. Federal and state regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervision of Victory State Bank, such as the right to impose restrictions on operations and the insistence that we increase our allowance for loan losses. Any change in the regulatory structure or statutes or regulations applicable to banks, bank holding companies, or their competitors, whether by the Congress, the FDIC, the Federal Reser ve System, the New York State legislature, the New York State Banking Department or any other regulator, could have a material impact on our operations and profitability. Since the substantial decline in the national housing market and the advent of the increase in bank failures over the past few years, there have been many proposals at both the state and federal level to change the way banks do business or change the entire structure under which banks and their operations are regulated and examined. Proposals at the federal level could, for example, increase competition by facilitating cross-state branching or increase competitive pressures by permitting banks to pay interest on business checking accounts. There have recently been changes at both the state and the federal level in the laws and regulations applicable to residential mortgage lenders and other entities in the residential real estate business. We are not a residential mortgage lender and we do not expect that these proposals, if adopted, will have a direct negative effect on us. However, the proposals could reduce residential development, increase the cost of housing, and restrict the ability of small local businesses in that sector to compete with larger companies with greater resources. That could have an adverse effect on our customer base. Furthermore, proposals to permit what are commonly known as “cram downs” in bankruptcies involving residential mortgage loans could have a direct adverse effect on the value of the collateral for existing residentia l mortgage loans, and thus an indirect effect on mortgage-backed securities in which we invest. Delays in foreclosure proceedings may adversely affect our ability to realize upon the value of collateral. The length of time it takes to prosecute a foreclosure action and be able to sell real estate collateral in New York has substantially lengthened. It is not unusual for it to take more than a full year from the date a foreclosure action is commenced until the property is sold even in uncontested cases, and some uncontested cases can take as long as two years. This problem, if it continues or gets worse, could have a substantial adverse effect on the value of the Bank’s collateral for loans in default. Especially in the case of construction loans, where pro perty value deterioration during a lengthy foreclosure is more likely, the inability to realize upon collateral increases the loss to the Bank in the event of a default. We operate in an extremely competitive environment. We operate in one of the most competitive environments for financial products in the world. Many of the world’s largest financial institutions have offices in our local communities, and they have far greater financial resources than we have. We seek to distinguish ourselves from those institutions by providing personalized service and providing the same level of care to small community based businesses that only Fortune 500 companies can obtain from the largest banks. Furthermore, changes in statutes and regulations, such as a proposal now being discussed in Congress to increase interstate bank branc h flexibility, could increase competition. 7 The loss of key personnel could impair our future success. Our future success depends in part on the service of our executive officer, other key management officers, as well as our staff, and our ability to continue to attract, motivate, and retain additional highly qualified employees. The loss of one or more of our key personnel or our inability to timely recruit replacements for such personnel, or otherwise attract, motivate, or retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Lending Activities Loan Portfolio Composition. Our loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial mortgage loans and unsecured commercial loans. At December 31, 2009, we had total unsecured commercial loans outstanding of $10,966,874, or 13.9% of total loans, and commercial real estate loans of $48,767,729, or 61.7% of total loans. There were $13,258,000 of construction loans secured by real estate, $10,964,000 of which were construction loans to businesses for the construction of either commercial property or residential property for sale, representing 13.9% of total loans. Other loans in our portfolio principally included commercial loans secured by assets othe r than real estate totaling $1,138,308 or 1.4% of total loans at December 31, 2009; residential mortgage loans of $2,914,956, or 3.7% of total loans and consumer non-mortgage loans of $532,498 or 0.7% of total loans. Although we generally do not make traditional permanent residential mortgage loans, we occasionally make residential mortgage loans to the principals of commercial customers. For the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately $57,748,986, or 73.1%, of loans for business purposes had adjustable interest rates based on the prime rate of interest.

The following table shows the contractual maturity of our loans at December 31, 2009. As we have decreased construction loans as a percentage of our loan portfolio and increased other real estate mortgage loans, we have increased the average contractual maturity of our loan portfolio. However, to limit interest rate risk, we have continued to concentrate our efforts principally on the origination of loans with adjustable interest rates and minimum interest rate floors. At December 31, 2009 Commercial Commercial Other Unsecured Secured Construction Real Estate Loans Total Amounts due: Within one year $ 7,376,870 $ 626,320 $ 11,190,500 $ 10,290,041 $ 1,851,091 $ 31,334,822 After one year: One to five years 3,590,004 511,988 2,067,500 7,909,943 136,631 14,216,066 After five years — — — 33,482,701 — 33,482,701 Total amount due 10,966,874 1,138,308 13,258,000 51,682,685 1,987,722 79,033,589 Less: Unearned fees — — 31,076 168,357 — 199,433 Allowance for loan losses 460,474 8,124 71,968 458,517 64,371 1,063,454 Loans, net $ 10,506,400 $ 1,130,184 $ 13,154,956 $ 51,055,811 $ 1,923,351 $ 77,770,702 9 The following table sets forth at December 31, 2009, the dollar amount of all loans, due after December 31, 2010, and whether such loans have fixed or variable interest rates.

We originate commercial business loans directly to the professional and business community in our market area. We target small to medium sized businesses and professionals such as lawyers, doctors and accountants. Applications for commercial business loans are obtained primarily from the efforts of our directors and senior management, who have extensive contacts in the local business community, or from branch referrals. As of December 31, 2009, commercial business loans totaled $12,105,182 or 15.3% of total loans. Commercial business loans we originate generally have terms of five years or less and have adjustable interest rates tied to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus a margin. Most of our commercial business loans have terms of less than one year and one of the challenges facing management is the constant effort to originate commercial business loans as existing loans are repaid. Such loans may be secured or unsecured. Secured commercial business loans can be collateralized by receivables, inventory and other assets. All these loans are either loans to individuals for which they have personal liability or loans to entities backed by the personal guarantee of principals of the borrower. The loans generally have shorter maturities and higher yields than real estate mortgage loans. Management has ex tensive experience in originating commercial business loans within our marketplace. Commercial business loans generally carry the greatest credit risks of the loans in our portfolio because repayment is more dependent on the success of the business operations of the borrower. Some of these loans are unsecured and those that are secured frequently have collateral that rapidly depreciates or is difficult to control in the event of a default. Commercial Real Estate Lending. We originate commercial real estate loans that are generally secured by properties used for business purposes such as retail stores, other mixed-use (business and residential) properties, restaurants, light industrial buildings and small office buildings located in our primary market area. Our commercial real estate loans are generally made in amounts up to 70% of the appraised value of the property. These loans are most commonly made with terms up to five years with interest rates that adjust to 100 or 150 basis points above the floating prime rate. A significant portion of these loans are subject to an interest rate floor ranging between 7.00% and 8.00%. Our underwriting standards consider the collateral of the borrower, the net operating income of the property and the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability. We require personal guarantees from the borrower or the principals of the borrowing entity. At December 31, 2009, our commercial real estate loans totaled $51,682,685, or 65.4% of total loans. Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally larger and have traditionally been considered to involve greater risks than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, but generally lesser risks than commercial business loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy, to a greater extent than other types of loans. We seek to minimize these risks through our lending policies and underwriting standards, which restrict new originations of such loans to our primary lending area and qualify such loans on the basis of the property’s income stream, collateral value and debt service ratio. 10 Construction Lending. Our construction loans primarily have been made to builders and developers to finance the construction of one- to four-family residential properties and, to a lesser extent, multi-family residential real estate properties. Our policies provide that construction loans may be made in amounts up to the lesser of 80% of the total hard and soft costs of the project. We generally require personal guarantees. Construction loans generally are made with prime-based interest rates with terms up to 18 months. Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as inspections warrant. At December 31, 2009, our construction lo ans totaled $13,258,000 or 16.8% of total loans. This represents a reduction of our construction loan portfolio over the past three years as economic conditions in the construction industry caused us to be more cautious in originating these loans while also reducing the number of satisfactory loan opportunities available to us. Construction loans on non-owner occupied real estate generally carry greater credit risks than permanent mortgage loans on comparable completed properties because their repayment is more dependent on the borrower’s ability to sell or rent units under construction and the general as well as local economic conditions. Because payments on construction loans are often dependent on the successful completion of construction project and the management of the project, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy, to a greater extent than other types of loans. In addition, in the event of a default, buildings under construction may deteriorate rapidly and it may be more difficult to realize upon the value of the building compared to an existing building that is ready for occ upancy or already rented to third party tenants. Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. All unsecured loans in excess of $250,000 and all secured loans over $400,000, are reviewed and approved by the Loan Committee, which consists of seven directors of Victory State Bank, prior to commitment. Smaller loans may be approved by underwriters designated by the Bank’s Chief Executive Officer. Consumer loans not secured by real estate and unsecured consumer loans, depending on the amount of the loan and the loan to value ratio, where applicable, require the approval of the Bank’s Chief Lending Officer and/or Chief Executive Officer. Upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower, we order a credit report and we verify other information. If necessary, we request additional financial information. An independent appraiser we designate performs an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan. The Board of Victory State Bank annually approves the independent appraisers and approves the Bank’s appraisal policy. It is our policy to obtain title insurance on all real estate first mortgage loans and on substantially all subordinate mortgage loans. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance prior to closing. Some borrowers are required to make monthly escrow deposits which we then use to pay items such as real estate taxes. Delinquencies and Classified Assets Delinquent Loans. Our collection procedures for mortgage loans include sending a past due notice at 15 days and a late notice after payment is 30 days past due. In the event that payment is not received after the late notice, letters are sent or phone calls are made to the borrower. We attempt to obtain full payment or work out a repayment schedule with the borrower to avoid foreclosure. Generally, we authorize foreclosure proceedings when a loan is over 90 days delinquent. We record property acquired in foreclosure as real estate owned at the lower of its appraised value less costs to dispose, or cost. We cease to accrue interest on all loans 90 days past due and reverse all accrued but unpaid interest when the loan becomes non-accrual. We continue to accrue interest on construction loans that are 90 days past the maturity date of the loan if we expect the loan to be paid in full in the next 60 days and all interest is paid up to date. The collection procedures for non-mortgage other loans generally include telephone calls to the borrower after ten days of the delinquency and late notices at 15 and 25 days past due. Letters and telephone calls generally continue until the matter is referred to a collection attorney or resolved. After the loan is 90 days past due, the loan is referred to counsel and is written-off. 11 Classified Assets. Federal regulations and our Loan Review and Risk Rating Policy provide for the classification of loans and other assets we consider to be of lesser quality as “Substandard”, “Doubtful” or “Loss” assets. An asset is considered “Substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “Do ubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “Substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “Loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification but which possess weaknesses are designated “Special Mention” by management. At December 31, 2009, we had thirty two (32) loans, in the aggregate amount of $11,191,987, designated as special mention. We had seventeen (17) loans, in the aggregate amount of $4,098,640, classified as substandard, thirteen of which, in the aggregate amount of $4,028,909, are secured by real estate. Special mention loans totaled $4,402,731 and substandard loans totaled $3,999,240 at year end 2008. We believe that the increase in loans designated special mention reflects the effects of the adverse conditions in the economy on our borrowers. The Bank actively monitors all special mention loans to seek to avoid deterioration in the quality of the loan. The Bank is actively collecting the substandard loans and expects to collect substantially all the amounts due. We had no loans classified as doubtful or loss as of December 31, 2009. When we classify an asset as Substandard or Doubtful, we provide, as part of our general allowance for loan losses, an amount management deems prudent to recognize the risks pertaining to the asset. A general allowance represents a loss allowance which has been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike a specific allowance, has not been allocated to particular problem assets. When we classify an asset as “Loss,” we either establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset or charge off that amount. Victory State Bank’s Loan Review Officer and Board of Directors regularly review problem loans and review all classified assets on a quarterly basis. We believe our policies are consistent with the regulatory requirements regarding classified assets. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the New York State Banking Department and the FDIC, which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. 12 The following table sets forth delinquencies in our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated: At December 31, 2009 60-89 Days 90 Days or more Number Principal Number Principal Commercial real estate 9 $ 3,848,990 7 $ 1,176,114 Commercial construction — — 2 480,000 Commercial unsecured 4 61,907 1 41,037 Real Estate - one-to-four family 3 2,299,322 — — Total 16 $ 6,210,219 10 $ 1,697,151 Delinquent loans to total loans 7.86 % 2.15 % At December 31, 2008 60-89 Days 90 Days or more Number Principal Number Principal Commercial real estate 2 $ 207,047 5 $ 1,453,846 Commercial construction — — 2 480,000 Commercial unsecured — — 7 345,221 Total 2 $ 207,047 14 $ 2,279,067 Delinquent loans to total loans 0.31 % 3.43 % At December 31, 2007 60-89 Days 90 Days or more Number Principal Number Principal Commercial real estate 2 $ 1,406,936 3 $ 459,371 Commercial construction 2 2,944,000 6 2,505,134 Commercial unsecured 1 300,000 2 14,970 Other — — 1 5,877 Total 5 $ 4,650,936 12 $ 2,985,352 Delinquent loans to total loans 7.43 % 4.77 % At December 31, 2006 60-89 Days 90 Days or more Number Principal Number Principal Commercial real estate — $ — 3 $ 773,924 Commercial unsecured 2 29,648 1 20,709 Other 1 9,676 — — Total 3 $ 39,324 4 $ 794,633 Delinquent loans to total loans 0.06 % 1.19 % At December 31, 2005 60-89 Days 90 Days or more Number Principal Number Principal Commercial real estate — $ — 6 $ 1,123,081 Commercial construction — — 2 579,000 Commercial unsecured 1 8,420 — — Total 1 $ 8,420 8 $ 1,702,081 Delinquent loans to total loans 0.01 % 2.29 % Loans 90 days or more past due represent non-accrual loans and loans that are contractually past due maturity but are still accruing interest.

We had ten non-performing loans, totaling $1,697,151, at December 31, 2009, compared to thirteen non-performing loans, totaling $2,279,067, at December 31, 2008. The following is information about the four largest non-performing loans, totaling $1,256,964 in outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2009. Management believes it has taken appropriate steps with a view towards maximizing recovery and minimizing loss on these loans. ● $859,968 in three construction loans to a builder secured and cross-collateralized by first mortgage liens on three lots in Staten Island on which single family houses are near completion. The loans are past maturity and we commenced foreclosure actions in 2008. The foreclosure sale was held in January 2010 and the Bank was the successful bidder. We have an agreement with a builder to assign our bid to the builder upon the payment to us of an amount sufficient to exceed the value of the loans on our books, and thus we will not record any loss upon the foreclosure sale and the subsequent assignment of our bid to the builder. ● $396,996 in a loan to a local business in which we are a participant in the loan with another bank. We are not the lead lender. The loan is in arrears and the lead lender has commenced a foreclosure action. The loan is secured by a first mortgage on a commercial building, a security interest in the business, and the personal guaranties of the principals. Allowance for Loan Losses It is our policy to provide a valuation allowance for probable incurred losses on loans based on our past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, adverse situations which may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions in our lending area. The allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses charged to earnings and is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. While management uses available information to estimate losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based upon any changes in economic conditions or if our loan portfolio increases. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank’s allowance for loan lo sses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on judgments different from those of management. Management believes, based upon all relevant and available information, that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate. When analyzing whether the level of the allowance for loan losses is appropriate, management considers performing loans in our loan portfolio that have no material identified weaknesses. Management establishes an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the performing loans in each of our five principal loan categories to be included in the allowance to cover inherent weaknesses in the broad category of loans. The fixed percentages are based upon historical loss experience in each category, the state of the economy, special risks in that particular category, and other factors that management deems relevant. Management also analyzes each loan that has been identified as having specific weaknesses to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for that loan. This analysis considers both the general factors which are considered in assessing performing loans as well as specific facts pertinent to each loan, such as collateral value, borrower’s income and ability to repay, payment history, the reasons for and length of the delinquency, and the value of any credit support. Although loans may be analyzed individually or in groups to determine the allowance, the entire allowance is available for any losses that occur. In order to assist in determining the allowance, an independent loan review firm, senior management and the Bank’s Board of Directors review the allowance for loan losses quarterly. If they determine that the allowance is inappropriate, then management increases or decreases the provision for loan losses to bring the allowance to the appropriate level. As of December 31, 2009, our allowance for loan losses was $1,063,454 or 1.35% of total loans. Based upon all relevant and presently available information, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate. We continue to monitor and modify the level of the allowance for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at a level which management considers appropriate. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary, based on changes in economic and local market conditions beyond management’s control. In addition, federal and state bank regulatory agencies periodically review Victory State Bank’s loan loss allowance as part of their periodic safety and soundness examinations of the Bank. They may recommend or seek to compe l increases in the allowance if they believe that weaknesses in the loan portfolio are more significant than management’s assessment. 15 The following table sets forth the activity in our allowance for loan losses: For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Allowance for Loan Losses: Balance at beginning of period $ 987,876 $ 927,161 $ 1,128,824 $ 1,153,298 $ 1,299,520 Charge-offs: Real estate loans: Commercial (110,241 ) — — — — Commercial loans: Unsecured (412,112 ) (483,326 ) (254,986 ) (62,181 ) (318,399 ) Consumer loan (18,606 ) (7,959 ) — (17,511 ) — Other loans (15,679 ) (3,503 ) (8,639 ) (28,111 ) (25,302 ) Total charge-offs (556,638 ) (494,788 ) (263,625 ) (107,803 ) (343,701 ) Recoveries 72,216 270,503 66,962 148,329 257,479 Net (charge-offs) / recoveries (484,422 ) (224,285 ) (196,663 ) 40,526 (86,222 ) Provision charged to income 560,000 285,000 (5,000 ) (65,000 ) (60,000 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,063,454 $ 987,876 $ 927,161 $ 1,128,824 $ 1,153,298 Ratio of net charge-offs / (recoveries) during the period to average loans outstanding during the period 0.68 % 0.35 % 0.32 % -0.06 % 0.12 % Ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at the end of period 1.35 % 1.49 % 1.48 % 1.69 % 1.55 % Ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at the end of the period 62.66 % 43.35 % 96.56 % 538.61 % 72.03 % Ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-performing assets at the end of the period 62.66 % 43.35 % 96.56 % 538.61 % 72.03 % The following table sets forth the allocation of our allowance for loan losses among each of the categories listed.

Additionally, it is appropriate for us to maintain investments for ongoing liquidity needs and we have maintained liquid assets at a level believed to be adequate to meet our normal daily activities. Our investment policy, established by the Board of Directors of Victory State Bank and implemented by its Asset/Liability Committee, attempts to provide and maintain liquidity, generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and complement our lending activities. Although we classify most of our securities portfolio as available for sale, it is our practice to retain most of our securities until they mature. 16 Our policies generally limit investments to government and federal agency securities or AAA rated securities, including corporate debt obligations, which are investment grade with weighted average lives of seven years or less. Our policies provide that all investment purchases be ratified by the Bank’s Board and may only be initiated by the President or Chief Financial Officer of the Bank. Investment securities consist of collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”) with estimated average lives, based upon prepayment assumptions that management believes are reasonable, of 4.5 years or less, mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) with maturities of seven years or less and U.S. Agency notes with a maturity of less than 15 years. These CMOs and MBS are backed by federal agencies such as Federal National Mortgage Association (̶ 0;FNMA”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) or are “AAA” rated whole loan securities. No investment securities in our portfolio have experienced ratings down grades. At December 31, 2009, we had investment securities with a cost basis of $110,914,773 and a fair value of $113,912,404. All investment securities at December 31, 2009, were either CMO’s or MBS’s. The entire investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 was classified as available for sale and is accounted on a fair market value basis. The following table sets forth certain information regarding the amortized cost and fair values of the investment securities, available for sale portfolio at the dates indicated. The excess of fair value over amortized cost at year end 2009 is the result of the effect of recent low market interest rates on the value of previously-purchased investment securities. If market interest rates were to increase, we anticipate that this excess would decrease and, under certain circumstances depending upon the timing of securities purchases and the rate of increase in interest rates, amortized cost may exceed fair value.

Deposits are the primary source of our funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes. In addition to deposits, we obtain funds from principal repayments and prepayments on loans and securities. Loan and securities repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows as well as unscheduled prepayments are influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposits consist of non-interest bearing checking accounts, money market accounts, time deposit (“certificate”) accounts, statement savings and NOW accounts. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market rates, prevailing interest rates and competition. Our deposits are obtained primarily from the areas in which our offices are located. We do not actively solicit certificate accounts in excess of $100,000, nor do we use brokers to obtain deposits. However, in connection with our efforts in establishing banking development districts in Staten Island, we accept larg e balance municipal deposits as part of the New York State and New York City banking development district programs. These municipal deposits total $35 million, are at a subsidized rate, and mature on a quarterly or an annual basis. There can be no assurance that the Bank will be able to retain these municipal deposits or be able to renew them at subsidized rates as compared to current market rates at that time. Management constantly monitors our deposit accounts and, based on historical experience, management believes it will retain a large portion of such accounts upon maturity. Deposit account terms we offer vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods that the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rates, among other factors. In determining the characteristics of the deposit account programs we offer, we consider potential profitability, matching terms of the deposits with loan products, the attractiveness to the customers and the rate s offered by our competitors. Our focus on customer service, primarily for the business and professional community in our marketplace, has facilitated our retention of non-interest bearing checking accounts and low costing NOW and savings accounts, which generally have interest rates substantially less than certificate of deposits. At December 31, 2009, these types of low cost deposit accounts amounted to $117,876,314, or 55.9% of total deposits. 18 The following table presents deposit activity for the periods indicated.

On August 8, 2008, we repaid the subordinated debenture in full at par, received payment of $155,000 on account of our common securities of the Trust, and all the outstanding Trust Preferred Capital Securities were likewise redeemed, thereby ending the entire arrangement. Personnel As of December 31, 2009, we had 45 full-time employees and 15 part-time employees. These employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 19 REGULATION AND SUPERVISION Regulation of VSB Bancorp, Inc. VSB Bancorp, Inc., is a New York corporation and is subject to and governed by the New York Business Corporation Law. It is a bank holding company and thus is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve. Bank Holding Company Regulation. As a bank holding company, we are required to file periodic reports and other information with the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve may conduct examinations of us. We are subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve. The guidelines apply on a consolidated basis and require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 4.0%. The minimum ratio is 3.0% for the most highly rated bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve’s capital adequacy guidelines also require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.0%. As of December 31, 2009, the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets was 9.67%, the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 21.88%, and the ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets was 22.89%. Our ability to pay dividends can be restricted if overall capital falls below levels established by the Federal Reserve’s guidelines. Federal Reserve approval is required if we seek to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of 5% or more of the voting shares of a bank or bank holding company. We must obtain Federal Reserve approval before we acquire all or substantially all the assets of a bank or merge or consolidate with another bank holding company. These provisions also would apply to a bank holding company that sought to acquire 5% or more of the common stock of or to merge or consolidate with us. Bank holding companies like us may not engage in activities other than banking and activities so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Federal Reserve regulations contain a list of permissible non-banking activities that are closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks and the Federal Reserve has identified a limited number of additional activities by order. These activities include lending activities, certain data processing activities, and securities brokerage and investment advisory services, trust activities and leasing activities. A bank holding company must file an application or a notice with the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring more than 5% of the voting shares of a company engaged in such activities. A bank holding company that is well capitalized and well managed and meets other conditions may provide notice after making the acquisition. We have the right to elect to be treated as a financial holding company if the Bank is well capitalized and well managed and has at least a satisfactory record of performance under the Community Reinvestment Act. Financial holding companies that meet certain conditions may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities, or activities that are complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. Federal law identifies certain activities that are deemed to be financial in nature, including non-banking activities currently permissible for bank holding companies to engage in both within and outside the United States, as well as insurance and securities underwriting and merchant banking activiti es. The Federal Reserve may identify additional activities that are permissible financial activities. No prior notice to the Federal Reserve is required for a financial holding company to acquire a company engaged in these activities or to commence these activities directly or indirectly through a subsidiary. We have not elected to be treated as a financial holding company since we have no current plans to use the authority to engage in expanded activities. However, we may elect to do so in the future. 20 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) imposes a broad range of corporate governance and accounting requirements for public companies (including VSB Bancorp, Inc.) designed to promote honesty and transparency in corporate America. Among many other provisions, Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that public company annual reports describe the responsibility of management to establish and maintain an internal control structure and contain an assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures of the issuer for financial reporting. The Securities and Exchange Commission had extended the deadline for non-accelerated filers (such as VS B Bancorp, Inc.) to comply with all of the requirements under Section 404. This is our third Annual Report for which we are required to include a report under Section 404 and we have included such a report as Item 9A of this Annual Report. We are not yet required to include an audit report by our independent registered public accountants as to management’s assessment under Section 404. Management’s assessment did not result in substantial additional cost because the financial nature of our business makes internal control and monetary reporting a fundamental component of the operation of much of our business. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission has stated that it will not approve any further extensions in the requirement that we include an accountant’s audit report of management’s assessment, so we expect to have to include that assessment in our annual report for 2010. That will result in a substantial increase in our accounting and auditing expense. Statutory Restrictions on Acquisition of VSB Bancorp, Inc., and Victory State Bank Applicable provisions of the New York Banking Law, the federal Bank Holding Company Act, and other federal statutes, restrict the ability of persons or entities to acquire control of a bank holding company. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, persons who intend to acquire control of a bank holding company, either directly or indirectly or through or in concert with one or more persons must give 60 days’ prior written notice to the Federal Reserve. “Control” would exist when an acquiring party directly or indirectly has voting control of at least 25% of our voting securities or the power to direct our management or policies. Under Federal Reserve regulations, a rebuttable presumption of control would arise with respect to an acquisition where, after the transaction, the acquiring party has ownership control, or the powe r to vote at least 10% (but less than 25%) of our common stock. The New York Banking Law requires prior approval of the New York Banking Board before any action is taken that causes any company to acquire direct or indirect control of a banking institution that is organized in the State of New York. The term “control” is defined generally to mean the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the banking institution and is presumed to exist if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote 10% or more of the voting stock of the banking institution. Section 912 of the New York Business Corporation Law, known as the New York Anti-Takeover Law, restricts the ability of interested stockholders to engage in business combinations with a New York corporation. In general terms, Section 912 prohibits any New York corporation covered by the statute from merging with an interested shareholder (i.e., one who owns 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock) for five years following the date on which the interested shareholder first acquired 20% of the stock, unless before that date the Board of Directors of the corporation had approved either the merger or the interested shareholder’s stock purchase. Section 912 defines an interested stockholder as the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation; and certain other entities that have owned 20% or more of a corporation’s stock during the past five years. A business combination is defined as a merger, consolidation, sale of 10% or more of the assets, or similar transaction. 21 Unless an interested stockholder waits five years after becoming an interested stockholder to engage in a business combination, the business combination is prohibited unless our Board of Directors has approved either (a) the business combination or (b) the acquisition of stock by the interested stockholder, before the interested stockholder acquired its 20% interest. Even though the interested stockholder waits five years, the business combination is prohibited unless either: (i) the business combination or the acquisition of stock by the interested stockholder was approved by the Board of Directors before the interested stockholder acquired its 20% interest; (ii) the business combination is approved by a majority vote of all outstanding shares of stock not beneficially owned by the interested stockholder or its affiliates or associates at a meeting held at least five years after the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder; or (iii) the price paid for common stock acquired in the business combination is, in general terms, at least as much as the greater of (a) highest price paid by the interested stockholder for any stock since the interested stockholder first owned 5% of the stock of the corporation, or (b) the market value of the stock as of the date of announcement of the business combination; and the price paid for stock other than common stock is subject to comparable minimum standards. Regulation of Victory State Bank The Bank is subject to extensive regulation and examination by the New York State Banking Department (“Department”), as its chartering authority, and by the FDIC, as the insurer of its deposits. The federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans. The Bank must file reports with the Department and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as establishing branches and mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions. There are periodic examinations by the Department and the FDIC to test the Bank’s compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Department, the FDIC or as a result of the enactment of legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and its operations. Capital Requirements The FDIC imposes capital adequacy standards on state-chartered banks, which, like the Bank, are not members of the Federal Reserve System. The FDIC’s capital regulations establish a minimum 3.0% Tier I leverage capital requirement for the most highly-rated state-chartered, non-member banks, with an additional cushion of at least 100 basis points for all other state-chartered, non-member banks, which effectively will increase the minimum Tier I leverage ratio for such other banks to 4.0%. Under the FDIC’s regulation, the highest-rated banks are those that the FDIC determines are not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and have well diversified risk, including no undue interest rate risk exposure, excellent asset quality, high liquidity, good earnings and, in general, which are considered a strong banking organization and are rated composite 1 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System. Tier I or core capital is defined as the sum of common stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings), non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, minus all intangible assets other than certain qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain mortgage servicing rights. 22 The FDIC also requires that banks meet a risk-based capital standard. The risk-based capital standard for banks requires the maintenance of a ratio of total capital (which is defined as Tier I capital and supplementary capital) to risk-weighted assets of 8.0% and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets of 4%. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, plus certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight of 0% to 100%, based on the risks the FDIC believes are inherent in the type of asset or item. The components of Tier I capital are the same as for the leverage capital standard. The components of supplementary capital include certain perpetual preferred stock, certain mandatory convertible securities, certain subordi­nated debt and intermediate preferred stock and general allowances for loan and l ease losses. Allowance for loan and lease losses includable in supplementary capital is limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Overall, the amount of capital counted toward supplementary capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital. The FDIC has an additional, higher capital level, known as well-capitalized. In order to be classified as well-capitalized, a bank must have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%. At December 31, 2009, the Bank exceeded all of the capital ratio standards for a well-capitalized bank. The following table shows the Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios. To be well-capitalized For capital under prompt corrective Actual adequacy purposes action provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio As of December 31, 2009 Tier 1 Capital (to Average Assets) $ 22,468,000 9.51 % $ 9,454,548 4.00 % $ 11,818,185 5.00 % Tier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 22,468,000 21.94 % 4,095,720 4.00 % 6,143,580 6.00 % Total Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 23,531,000 22.98 % 8,191,440 8.00 % 10,239,300 10.00 % There have been a number of recent proposals and suggestions by regulators, politicians and commentators that the capital ratio standards should be increased. Our current capital ratios are more than sufficient to satisfy any reasonably anticipated increase. However, an increase in the amount of capital that the Bank must maintain in order to support a given level of assets would reduce the amount of leverage that our capital could support. This might adversely affect our ability to increase our level of interest-earning assets. Activities and Investments of New York-Chartered Banks. The Bank derives its lending, investment and other authority primarily from the applicable provisions of New York State Banking Law and the regulations of the Department, as limited by FDIC regulations and other federal laws and regulations. See “Activities and Investments of FDIC Insured State-Chartered Banks” below. These New York laws and regulations authorize the Bank to invest in real estate mortgages, consumer and commercial loans, certain types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, State and local governments and agencies, and certain other assets. A bank’s aggregate lending powers are not subject to percentage of asset limitations, although there are limits applicable to single borrowers. A New York-chartered bank may also exercise trust powers upon approval of the Department. The Bank does not have trust powers. The New York Banking Board has the power to adopt regulations that enable state chartered banks to exercise the rights, powers and privileges permitted for a national bank. The Bank has not engaged in material activities authorized by such regulations. 23 With certain limited exceptions, the Bank may not make loans or extend credit for commercial, corporate or business purposes (including lease financing) to a single borrower, the aggregate amount of which would be in excess of 15% of the Bank’s net worth, on an unsecured basis, and 25% of the net worth if the excess is collateralized by readily marketable collateral or collateral otherwise having a value equal to the amount by which the loan exceeds 15% of the Bank’s net worth. Theses limits do not apply to loans made by VSB Bancorp, Inc. directly at the holding company level. The Bank currently complies with all applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations and VSB Bancorp, Inc. has not made any loans in its own name except for its loan to its Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Activities and Investments of FDIC-Insured State-Chartered Banks. The activities and equity invest­ments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks are generally limited to those that are permissible for national banks. Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets, (iii) acquiring up to 10% of th e voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors’, trustees’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage or bankers’ blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (iv) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met. In addition, an FDIC-insured state-chartered bank may not directly, or indirectly through a subsidiary, engage as “principal” in any activity that is not permissible for a national bank unless the FDIC has determined that such activities would pose no risk to the insurance fund of which it is a member and the bank is in compliance with applicable regulatory capital requirements. Regulatory Enforcement Authority Applicable banking laws include substantial enforcement powers available to federal banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties, as defined. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. Under the New York State Banking Law, the Department may issue an order to a New York-chartered banking institution to appear and explain an apparent violation of law, to discontinue unauthorized or unsafe practices and to keep prescribed books and accounts. Upon a finding by the Department that any director, trustee or officer of any banking organization has violated any law, or has continued unauthorized or unsafe practices in conducting the business of the banking organization after having been notified by the Department to discontinue such practices, such director, trustee or officer may be removed from office by the Department after notice and an opportunity to be heard. The Bank does not know of any past or current practice, condition or violation that might lead to any proceeding by the Department against the Bank or any of its dir ectors or officers. The Department also may take possession of a banking organization under specified statutory criteria. Prompt Corrective Action. Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The extent of the regulators’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” A bank is deemed to be (i) “well capitalized” if it has total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or more, has a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more, has a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or more and is not subject to specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital me asure, (ii) “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% or more and a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 4.0% or more (3.0% under certain circumstances) and does not meet the definition of “well capitalized,” (iii) “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0% or a Tier I leverage capital ratio that is less than 4.0% (3.0% under certain circumstances), (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3.0% or a Tier I leverage capital ratio that is less than 3.0%, and (v) “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. The regulations also provide that a federal banking regulator may, after notice an d an opportunity for a hearing, reclassify a “well capitalized” institution as “adequately capitalized” and may require an “adequately capitalized” institution or an “undercapitalized” institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category if the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. The federal banking regulator may not, however, reclassify a “significantly undercapital­ized” institution as “critically undercapitalized.” 24 An institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements, as well as a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution, with an appropriate federal banking regulator within 45 days of the date that the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Immediately upon becoming undercapitalized, an institution becomes subject to statutory provisions, which, among other things, set forth various mandatory and discretionary restrictions on the operations of such an institution. At December 31, 2009, the Company and the Bank had capital levels which qualified them as “well-capitalized” institutions. FDIC Insurance The Bank is a member of the FDIC. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-­insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. In the past year, there have been many failures and near-failures among financial institutions. The number of FDIC-insured banks that have failed has increased, and the FDIC insurance fund reserve ratio, representing the ratio of the fund to the level of insured deposits, has declined due to losses caused by bank failures. As a result, the FDIC has increased its deposit insurance premiums on remaining institutions, including well-capitalized institutions like Victory State Bank, in order to replenish the insurance fund. If bank failures continue to occur, and more so if the level of failures increases, the FDIC insurance fund will further decline, and the FDIC is likely to continue to impose higher premiums on healthy banks. Thus, despite the prudent steps we may take to avoid the mistakes made by other banks, our costs of operations may increase as a result of those mistakes by others. Our FDIC insurance premium was $369,965 in 2009. In 2009, the FDIC announced an increase in deposit insurance premiums so institutions like our Bank, even though we are in the lowest regulatory risk category, will be subject to an assessment rate between seven (7) and twelve (12) basis points per annum, which is higher than the assessment rate in 2008 of from five (5) to seven (7) basis points. Additionally, the FDIC imposed a 5 basis point special assessment, based on June 30, 2009 total assets net of Tier 1 capital, that we paid on September 30, 2009. The special assessment amounted to $101,950 and we accrued it prior to the quarter in which it was paid because it was based upon assets at June 30, 2009. The increase in the assessment rate and the special assessment have significantly increased our deposit insurance expense in 2009. The FDIC also required that FDIC-insured banks prepay, by the end of 2009, their entire projected FDIC premium assessment through the end of 2012. The prepaid amount will be expensed for financial reporting purposes gradually each quarter during the prepayment period. If our actual FDIC assessment during that period is less than the amount we prepay, the excess prepayment will be applied to future premiums we owe, and any excess prepayment remaining on December 31, 2014 would be refunded to us. Although the prepayment had no direct income statement effect when made, it reduced the funds we have available for investment in interest-earning assets because the FDIC will not pay interest on the prepayment. At December 31, 2009, we prepaid $1,025,945 to satisfy this requirement. 25 The FDIC has also recently increased insurance coverage on non-interest bearing demand accounts, Interest Only Lawyers Accounts (“IOLA”) and Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts paying less than 50 basis points to an unlimited amount, but with the payment of an additional assessment fee. On December 5, 2008, the Bank “opted in” to the Temporary Account Guarantee Program, providing for the unlimited insurance coverage on non-interest bearing transaction, IOLA and NOW accounts but we opted out of the Debt Guarantee Program. Although the increase in the amount of FDIC insurance available has no direct effect on our insurance premiums, the increase is likely to increase losses to the deposit insurance f und when banks fail. This could cause the FDIC to increase deposit insurance premiums on existing banks, or continue higher premium levels for a longer period of time, which would reduce our net income. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines, after a hearing, that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is aware of no existing circumstances that would resul t in termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance. Troubled Asset Relief Program and Capital Purchase Program In late 2008, the United States Department of the Treasury implemented a Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”) under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) pursuant to which the Treasury purchased preferred stock from approved institutions, with certain limitations and restrictions. The TARP CPP was entirely voluntary. VSB Bancorp, Inc. and Victory State Bank had, at the time of announcement, and still have, strong capital (Tier 1 Capital ratio in excess of 9% and Total Risk Based Capital ratio in excess of 20%). We did not originate or invest in subprime mortgages, nor in FNMA and FHLMC preferred stock. Upon reviewing all of the details of the Treasury’s TARP CPP, we elected not to participate in it. We have continued to make loans to creditworthy customers throughout 2009 as we increased th e size of our loan portfolio, so our decision to refuse the federal government’s TARP CPP money did not have an adverse effect on our ability to make loans. Brokered Deposits Under federal law and applicable regulations, (i) a well capitalized bank may solicit and accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit without restriction, (ii) an adequately capitalized bank may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC and (iii) an undercapitalized bank may not (x) accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit or (y) solicit deposits by offering an effective yield that exceeds by more than 75 basis points the prevailing effective yields on insured deposits of comparable maturity in such institution’s normal market area or in the market area in which such deposits are being solicited. The term “undercapitalized insured depository institution” is defined to mean any insured depository institution that fails to meet the minimum regulatory capital requirement prescribed by its appropriate federal banking agency. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis and upon application by an adequately capitalized insured depository institution, waive the restriction on brokered deposits upon a finding that the acceptance of brokered deposits does not constitute an unsafe or unsound practice with respect to such institution. The Bank had no brokered deposits outstanding at December 31, 2009. Community Reinvestment and Consumer Protection Laws In connection with its lending activities, the Bank is subject to a variety of federal laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. Included among these are the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act and Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). 26 The CRA requires FDIC insured banks to define the assessment areas that they serve, identify the credit needs of those assessment areas and take actions that respond to the credit needs of the community. The FDIC must conduct regular CRA examinations of the Bank and assign it a CRA rating of “outstanding,” “satisfac­tory,” “needs improvement” or “unsatisfactory.” The Bank is also subject to provisions of the New York State Banking Law which impose similar obligations to serve the credit needs of its assessment areas. The New York Banking Department makes a biennial written assessment of a bank’s compliance, and makes the assessment available to the public. Federal and New York State laws both require consideration of these ratings when reviewing a bank’s applicati on to engage in certain transactions, including mergers, asset purchases and the establishment of branch offices. A negative assessment may serve as a basis for the denial of any such application. The Bank has received “Satisfactory” ratings from both the New York Banking Department and the FDIC. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has recently proposed changes to its Truth in Lending regulations and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has recently proposed changes to its Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act regulations that may have a significant effect on consumer lending, especially residential mortgage lending to consumers. Although consumer lending is not a material part of our lending program, any changes which affect the housing industry have a potential to adversely affect our customers because, as we have explained throughout this annual report, the building trades, especially related to residential construction, are an important focus of our customer base. Therefore, any regulations that make it more expensive for our customers to operate, or that restrict the ability of our customers t o conduct business, could have an adverse effect on our operations. Limitations on Dividends The payment of dividends by the Bank is subject to various regulatory requirements. Under New York State Banking Law, a New York-chartered stock bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital, but approval of the Superintendent of Banks is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to certain adjustments. Miscellaneous The Bank is subject to restrictions on loans to its non-bank subsidiaries, on investments in the stock or securities thereof, on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower, and on the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of the Bank or its non-bank subsidiaries. The Bank also is subject to restrictions on most types of transactions with the Bank or its non-bank subsidiaries, requiring that the terms of such transactions be substantially equivalent to terms of similar transactions with non-affiliated firms. Assessments Banking institutions are required to pay assessments to both the FDIC and the NYSBD to fund their operations. The assessments are based upon the amount of the Bank’s total assets. The Bank must also pay an examination fee to the NYSBD when they conduct an examination. The Bank paid federal and state assessments and examination fees of $1,337,844 in 2009 which includes the FDIC special assessment paid in September 2009 and the prepayment of FDIC assessments for 2010, 2011 and 2012 paid in December 2009. Transactions with Related Parties The Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with related parties or “affiliates” (i.e., any entity that controls or is under common control with an institution, including the Bank) or to make loans to certain insiders is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. Section 23A limits the aggregate amount of transactions with any individual affiliate to 10% of the capital and surplus of the institution and also limits the aggregate amount of transactions with all affiliates to 20% of the institution’s capital and surplus. 27 Loans to affiliates must be secured by collateral with a value that depends on the nature of the collateral. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Loans and asset purchases with affiliates, must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. In the absence of comparable transactions, such transactions may only occur under terms and circumstances, including credit standards that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies. The Bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders, as well as entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Regulation O generally requires such loans to be made on terms substantially similar to those offered to unaffiliated individuals (except for preferential loans made in accordance with broad based employee benefit plans), places limits on the amount of loans the Bank may make to such persons based, in part, on the Bank’s capital position, and requires certain approval procedures to be followed. Standards for Safety and Soundness FDIC regulations require that Victory State Bank adopt procedures and systems designed to foster safe and sound operations in the areas of internal controls, information systems, internal and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. Among other things, these regulations prohibit compensation and benefits and arrangements that are excessive or that could lead to a material financial loss. If Victory State Bank fails to meet any of these standards, it will be required to submit to the FDIC a plan specifying the steps that will be taken to cure the deficiency. If it fails to submit an acceptable plan or fails to implement the plan, FDIC the will require it or VSB Bancorp, Inc. to correct the deficiency and until corrected, may impose restrictions on them. The FDIC has also adopted regulations that require Victory State Bank to adopt written loan policies and procedures that are consistent with safe and sound operation, are appropriate for the size of the Bank, and must be reviewed by the Bank’s Board of Directors annually. Victory State Bank has adopted such policies and procedures, the material provisions of which are discussed above as part of the discussion of our lending operations. 28 Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve Board regulations require banks to maintain non-interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily regular checking accounts and interest-bearing checking accounts). The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for accounts aggregating $44.5 million or less (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3%; for accounts greater than $44.5 million, the reserve requirement is $1.0 million plus 10% (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board between 8% and 14%) against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of $44.5 million. The first $10.7 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the res erve requirements. The Bank is in compliance with these requirements. The Federal Reserve now permits the payment of interest on reserve deposits so such deposits are now classified as interest-earning assets. However, due to the extremely low target federal funds rate in 2009 as established by the Federal Reserve, the amount of interest we earned on reserve deposits was negligible. The effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of our interest-earning assets that are available to invest in higher yielding assets, such as loans. However, due to the high level of overnight investments that we elected to maintain during 2009, the reserve deposit requirement and the low rate available on those deposits in 2009 did not cause us to forgo material income. TAXATION Federal Taxation General We are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehen­sive description of the tax rules applicable to us. Our federal income tax returns have not been audited or closed without audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Method of Accounting We report our income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a tax year ending December 31 for filing our consolidated federal income tax returns. The Company files consolidated tax returns with the Bank and previously with VSB Capital Trust I. Bad Debt Reserves We use the experience method in computing bad debt deductions for federal tax purposes. Minimum Tax The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (“alternative minimum taxable income” or “AMTI”). The AMT is payable to the extent such AMT is in excess of the Company’s regular tax liability. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMT. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. We have not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and have no such amounts available as credits. 29 State and Local Taxation New York State and New York City Taxation. New York State Franchise Tax on corporations is imposed in an amount equal to the greater of (a) 7.1% of “entire net income” allocable to New York State (b) 3% of “alternative entire net income” allocable to New York State (c) 0.01% of the average value of assets allocable to New York State or (d) a nominal minimum tax. Entire net income is based on federal taxable income, subject to certain modifications. Alternative entire net income is equal to entire net income without certain modifications. The New York City Corporation Tax is imposed using similar alternative taxable income methods and rates. A temporary Metropolitan Transportation Business Tax Surcharge on banking corporations doing business in the Metropolitan District has been applied since 1982. We transact a significant portion of our business within this District and thus we are subject to this surcharge. The current surcharge rate is 17% of the State franchise tax liability. New York City does not impose comparable surcharges. For New York State and City tax purposes, the bad debt deduction may be computed using a specific formula based on our actual loss history (“Experience Method”).
