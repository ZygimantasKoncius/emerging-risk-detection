ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.Risks Related to Our BusinessCertain elements of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ cost recovery through rates can be challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have also made certain commitments to federal and state regulators with respect to, among other things, our rates in connection with acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries provide transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC. The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rate templates used by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates. All aspects of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ rates approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, ITCTransmission’s, METC’s, ITC Midwest’s and ITC Great Plains’ respective allowed 13.88%, 13.38%, 12.38% and 12.16% rates of return on the actual equity portion of their respective capital structures, and the data inputs provided by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries for calculation of each year’s rate, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC in a proceeding under Section 206 of the FPA. If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC will make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula. This could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts collected after the date that a Section 206 challenge is filed.In the Minnesota regulatory proceeding to approve ITC Midwest’s December 2007 acquisition of the transmission assets of IP&L, ITC Midwest agreed to build two transmission projects intended to improve the reliability and efficiency of our electric transmission system. Specifically, ITC Midwest made commitments to use commercially reasonable best efforts to complete these projects prior to December 31, 2009 and 2011, respectively. In the event ITC Midwest is found to have failed to meet these commitments, the allowed 12.38% rate of return on the actual equity portion of ITC Midwest’s capital structure would be reduced to 10.39% until such time as ITC Midwest completes these projects, and ITC Midwest would refund with interest any amounts collected since the closing date of the transaction that exceeded what would have been collected if the 10.39% return on equity had been used. The project that was required to be completed prior to December 31, 2009 was completed by that deadline. With respect to the second project, the 345 kV Salem-Hazleton line, certain regulatory approvals were needed from the IUB before construction of the project could commence, but due to the IUB’s case schedule, these approvals were not received until the second quarter of 2011. As a result of the delay in the receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, the project was not completed by December 31, 2011. We believe we used commercially reasonable best efforts to meet the December 31, 2011 deadline. Any of the events described above could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ actual capital expenditures may be lower than planned, which would decrease expected rate base and therefore our expected revenues and earnings. In addition, we expect to invest in strategic development opportunities to improve the efficiency and reliability of the transmission grid, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to initiate or complete any of these investments.16Table of ContentsEach of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ rate base, revenues and earnings are determined in part by additions to property, plant and equipment when placed in service. We anticipate making significant capital investments over the next several years which include estimated transmission network upgrades for generator interconnections. The amounts for network upgrades could change significantly due to factors beyond our control, such as changes in the MISO queue for generation projects and whether the generator meets the various criteria of Attachment FF of the MISO Open Access Transmission, Energy, and Operating Reserve Markets Tariff for the project to qualify as a refundable network upgrade, among other factors. If our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ capital expenditures and the resulting in-service property, plant and equipment are lower than anticipated for any reason, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries will have a lower than anticipated rate base thus causing their revenue requirements and future earnings to be potentially lower than anticipated.In addition, we are pursuing broader strategic development investment opportunities for transmission construction related to building regional transmission facilities, interconnections for generating resources, and other investment opportunities. The incumbent utilities or other entities with transmission development initiatives may compete with us by deciding to pursue capital projects that we are pursuing. These estimates of potential investment opportunities are based primarily on foreseeable transmission needs and general transmission construction costs, not necessarily on particular project cost estimates.Any capital investment at our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries or as a result of our broader strategic development initiatives may be lower than expected due to, among other factors, the impact of actual loads, forecasted loads, regional economic conditions, weather conditions, union strikes, labor shortages, material and equipment prices and availability, our ability to obtain financing for such expenditures, if necessary, limitations on the amount of construction that can be undertaken on our system or transmission systems owned by others at any one time, regulatory approvals for reasons relating to rate construct, environmental, siting, regional planning, cost recovery or other issues or as a result of legal proceedings and variances between estimated and actual costs of construction contracts awarded. Our ability to engage in construction projects resulting from pursuing these initiatives is subject to significant uncertainties, including the factors discussed above, and will depend on obtaining any necessary regulatory and other approvals for the project and for us to initiate construction, our achieving status as the builder of the project in some circumstances and other factors. Therefore, we can provide no assurance as to the actual level of investment we may achieve at our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries or as a result of the broader strategic development initiatives.The regulations to which we are subject may limit our ability to raise capital and/or pursue acquisitions, development opportunities or other transactions or may subject us to liabilities.Each of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries is a “public utility” under the FPA and, accordingly, is subject to regulation by the FERC. Approval of the FERC is required under Section 203 of the FPA for a disposition or acquisition of regulated public utility facilities, either directly or indirectly through a holding company. Such approval may also be required to acquire securities in a public utility. Section 203 of the FPA also provides the FERC with explicit authority over utility holding companies’ purchases or acquisitions of, and mergers or consolidations with, a public utility. Finally, each of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries must also seek approval by the FERC under Section 204 of the FPA for issuances of its securities (including debt securities). We are also pursuing development projects for construction of transmission facilities and interconnections with generating resources. These projects may require regulatory approval by the FERC, applicable RTOs and state and local regulatory agencies. Failure to secure such regulatory approval for new strategic development projects could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and increase our revenues. If we fail to obtain these approvals when necessary, we may incur liabilities for such failure.Changes in federal energy laws, regulations or policies could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The formula rate templates used by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries to calculate their respective annual revenue requirements will be used by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries for that purpose until and unless the FERC determines that such formula rates are unjust and unreasonable and that another rate is just and reasonable. Such a determination could result from challenges initiated at the FERC by interested parties, or by the FERC on its own initiative, in a proceeding under Section 206 of the FPA. An existing formula rate also could be replaced by a successful application initiated by any of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries under Section 205 of the FPA. End-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may attempt to influence government 17Table of Contentsand/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially.Each of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries is regulated by the FERC as a “public utility” under the FPA and is a transmission owner in MISO or SPP. We cannot predict whether the approved rate methodologies for any of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries will be changed. In addition, the U.S. Congress periodically considers enacting energy legislation that could shift new responsibilities to the FERC, modify provisions of the FPA or provide the FERC or another entity with increased authority to regulate transmission matters. We cannot predict whether, and to what extent, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries may be affected by any such changes in federal energy laws, regulations or policies in the future.If amounts billed for transmission service for our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ transmission systems are lower than expected, or our actual revenue requirements are higher than expected, the timing of collection of our revenues would be delayed.If amounts billed for transmission service are lower than expected, which could result from lower network load or point-to-point transmission service on our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ transmission systems due to a weak economy, changes in the nature or composition of the transmission assets of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and surrounding areas, poor transmission quality of neighboring transmission systems, or for any other reason, the timing of the collection of our revenue requirement would likely be delayed until such circumstances are adjusted through the true-up mechanism in our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ formula rate templates. In addition, if the revenue requirements of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are higher than expected, the timing of the collection of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries' revenue requirements would likely be delayed until such circumstances are reflected through the true-up mechanism in our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries' expected, formula rate templates. The effect of such under-collection would be to reduce the amount of our available cash resources from what we had expected, until such under-collection is corrected through the true-up mechanism in the formula rate template, which may require us to increase our outstanding indebtedness, thereby reducing our available borrowing capacity, and may require us to pay interest at a rate that exceeds the interest to which we are entitled in connection with the operation of the true-up mechanism.Each of our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries depends on its primary customer for a substantial portion of its revenues, and any material failure by those primary customers to make payments for transmission services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.ITCTransmission derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the transmission of electricity to Detroit Edison’s local distribution facilities. Detroit Edison accounted for approximately 75.0% of ITCTransmission’s total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 and is expected to constitute the majority of ITCTransmission’s revenues for the foreseeable future. Detroit Edison is rated BBB+/stable and Baa1/positive by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Services, Inc., respectively. Similarly, Consumers Energy accounted for approximately 78.2% of METC’s total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 and is expected to constitute the majority of METC’s revenues for the foreseeable future. Consumers Energy is rated BBB-/positive and Baa2/positive by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., respectively. Further, IP&L accounted for approximately 80.0% of ITC Midwest’s total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 and is expected to constitute the majority of ITC Midwest’s revenues for the foreseeable future. IP&L is rated A-/stable and A3/stable by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., respectively. These percentages of total operating revenues of Detroit Edison, Consumers Energy and IP&L include an estimate for the 2012 revenue accrual and deferrals that were included in our 2012 operating revenues, but will not be billed to our customers until 2014. We have assumed that the revenues billed to these customers in 2014 would be in the same proportion of the respective percentages of network and regional cost sharing revenues billed to them in 2012.Any material failure by Detroit Edison, Consumers Energy or IP&L to make payments for transmission services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.A significant amount of the land on which our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ assets are located is subject to easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances. As a result, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries must comply with the provisions of various easements, mineral rights and other 18Table of Contentssimilar encumbrances, which may adversely impact their ability to complete construction projects in a timely manner.METC does not own the majority of the land on which its electric transmission assets are located. Instead, under the provisions of an Easement Agreement with Consumers Energy, METC pays annual rent of $10.0 million to Consumers Energy in exchange for rights-of-way, leases, fee interests and licenses which allow METC to use the land on which its transmission lines are located. Under the terms of the Easement Agreement, METC’s easement rights could be eliminated if METC fails to meet certain requirements, such as paying contractual rent to Consumers Energy in a timely manner. Additionally, a significant amount of the land on which ITCTransmission’s, ITC Midwest’s and ITC Great Plains’ assets are located is subject to easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances. As a result, they must comply with the provisions of various easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances, which may adversely impact their ability to complete their construction projects in a timely manner.Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries contract with third parties to provide services for certain aspects of their businesses. If any of these agreements are terminated, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries may face a shortage of labor or replacement contractors to provide the services formerly provided by these third parties.Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries enter into various agreements and arrangements with third parties to provide services for the operation of certain aspects of their businesses, which, if terminated could result in a shortage of a readily available workforce to provide these services. For example, ITC Midwest and IP&L have entered into the Operations Services Agreement For 34.5 kV Transmission Facilities (the “OSA”), under which IP&L performs certain operations functions for ITC Midwest’s 34.5 kV transmission system. The OSA’s term is from January 1, 2011 until December 31, 2015, and by its terms will remain in full force and effect from year to year thereafter until terminated by either party upon not less than one year’s prior written notice to the other party. If the OSA is terminated for any reason or at a time when ITC Midwest is unprepared for such termination, ITC Midwest may face difficulty finding a qualified replacement work force to provide such services, which could have an adverse effect on its ability to carry on its business and on its results of operations.Hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.The operations of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks. The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. We maintain property and casualty insurance, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are subject to environmental regulations and to laws that can give rise to substantial liabilities from environmental contamination.The operations of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for the management, treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and of solid and hazardous wastes, and impose obligations to investigate and remediate contamination in certain circumstances. Liabilities to investigate or remediate contamination, as well as other liabilities concerning hazardous materials or contamination such as claims for personal injury or property damage, may arise at many locations, including formerly owned or operated properties and sites where wastes have been treated or disposed of, as well as at properties currently owned or operated by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries. Such liabilities may arise even where the contamination does not result from noncompliance with applicable environmental laws. Under a number of environmental laws, such liabilities may also be joint and several, meaning that a party can be held responsible for more than its share of the liability involved, or even the entire share. Environmental requirements generally have become more stringent in recent years, and compliance with those requirements more expensive. Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries have incurred expenses in connection with environmental compliance, and we anticipate that each will continue to do so in the future. Failure to comply with the extensive environmental laws and regulations applicable to each could result in significant civil or criminal penalties and remediation costs. 19Table of ContentsOur Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ assets and operations also involve the use of materials classified as hazardous, toxic, or otherwise dangerous. Some of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ facilities and properties are located near environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands and habitats of endangered or threatened species. In addition, certain properties in which our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries operate are, or are suspected of being, affected by environmental contamination. Compliance with these laws and regulations, and liabilities concerning contamination or hazardous materials, may adversely affect our costs and, therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, claims have been made or threatened against electric utilities for bodily injury, disease or other damages allegedly related to exposure to electromagnetic fields associated with electric transmission and distribution lines. We cannot assure you that such claims will not be asserted against us or that, if determined in a manner adverse to our interests, such claims would not have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory requirements, including reliability standards; contract filing requirements; reporting, recordkeeping and accounting requirements; and transaction approval requirements. Violations of these requirements, whether intentional or unintentional, may result in penalties that, under some circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The various regulatory requirements to which we are subject include reliability standards established by the NERC, which acts as the nation’s Electric Reliability Organization approved by the FERC in accordance with Section 215 of the FPA. These standards address operation, planning and security of the bulk power system, including requirements with respect to real-time transmission operations, emergency operations, vegetation management, critical infrastructure protection and personnel training. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in monetary penalties as well as non-monetary sanctions. Monetary penalties vary based on an assigned risk factor for each potential violation, the severity of the violation and various other circumstances, such as whether the violation was intentional or concealed, whether there are repeated violations, the degree of the violator’s cooperation in investigating and remediating the violation and the presence of a compliance program. Penalty amounts range from $1,000 to a maximum of $1.0 million per day, depending on the severity of the violation. Non-monetary sanctions include potential limitations on the violator’s activities or operation and placing the violator on a watchlist for major violators. Despite our best efforts to comply and the implementation of a compliance program intended to ensure reliability, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur that would result in material penalties or sanctions. If any of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries were to violate the NERC reliability standards, even unintentionally, in any material way, any penalties or sanctions imposed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are also subject to requirements under Sections 203 and 205 of the FPA for approval of transactions; reporting, recordkeeping and accounting requirements; and for filing contracts related to the provision of jurisdictional services. Under FERC policy, failure to file jurisdictional agreements on a timely basis may result in foregoing the time value of revenues collected under the agreement, but not to the point where a loss would be incurred. The failure to obtain timely approval of transactions subject to FPA Section 203, or to comply with applicable reporting, recordkeeping or accounting requirements under FPA Section 205, could subject us to penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Acts of war, terrorist attacks and threats, including cyber attacks or threats, or the escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or otherwise may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Acts of war, terrorist attacks and threats, including cyber attacks or threats, or the escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or otherwise may negatively affect our business, financial condition and cash flows in unpredictable ways, such as increased security measures and disruptions of markets. Strategic targets, such as energy related assets, including, for example, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ transmission facilities and Detroit Edison’s, Consumers Energy’s and IP&L’s generation and distribution facilities, may be at risk of future terrorist attacks or threats, including cyber attacks or threats. In addition to the increased costs associated with heightened security requirements, such events may have a material effect on the economy in general. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.20Table of ContentsRisks Relating to Our Structure and Financial LeverageITC Holdings is a holding company with no operations, and unless we receive dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to pay dividends and fulfill our other cash obligations.As a holding company with no business operations, ITC Holdings’ material assets consist primarily of the stock and membership interests in our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries, deferred tax assets and cash on hand. Our only sources of cash to pay dividends to our stockholders are dividends and other payments received by us from time to time from our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries and the proceeds raised from the sale of our debt and equity securities. Each of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, however, is legally distinct from us and has no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends to ITC Holdings’ stockholders or otherwise. The ability of each of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to us is subject to, among other things, the availability of funds, after taking into account capital expenditure requirements, the terms of its indebtedness, applicable state laws and regulations of the FERC and the FPA. Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries target a FERC-approved capital structure of 60% equity and 40% debt that may limit the ability of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries to use net assets for the payment of dividends to ITC Holdings. While we currently intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock, we have no obligation to do so. The payment of dividends is within the absolute discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, anticipated cash needs and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.We are highly leveraged and our dependence on debt may limit our ability to fulfill our debt obligations and/or to obtain additional financing.We are highly leveraged and our consolidated indebtedness consists of various outstanding debt securities and borrowings under various revolving and term loan credit agreements. This capital structure can have several important consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:•If future cash flows are insufficient, we may not be able to make principal or interest payments on our debt obligations, which could result in the occurrence of an event of default under one or more of those debt instruments.•We may need to incur further indebtedness in order to make the capital expenditures and other expenses or investments planned by us.•Our indebtedness has the general effect of reducing our flexibility to react to changing business and economic conditions insofar as they affect our financial condition and, therefore, may pose substantial risk to our shareholders. A substantial portion of the dividends and payments in lieu of taxes we receive from our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries will be dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and the payment of dividends on our common stock.•In the event that we are liquidated, our senior or subordinated creditors and the senior or subordinated creditors of our subsidiaries will be entitled to payment in full prior to any distributions to the holders of shares of our common stock.•We currently have debt instruments outstanding with relatively short remaining maturities. Our ability to secure additional financing prior to or after these facilities mature, if needed, may be substantially restricted by the existing level of our indebtedness and the restrictions contained in our debt instruments. Additionally, the interest rates at which we might secure additional financings may be higher than our currently outstanding debt instruments or higher than forecasted at any point in time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.•Market conditions could affect our access to capital markets, restrict our ability to secure financing to make the capital expenditures and investments and pay other expenses planned by us and could affect our interest rate swap obligations which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.We may incur substantial indebtedness in the future, including in connection with the Entergy Transaction. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the leverage-related risks described above.21Table of ContentsCertain provisions in our debt instruments limit our financial flexibility.Our debt instruments include senior notes, secured notes, first mortgage bonds, and revolving and term loan credit agreements containing numerous financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on, among other things, our ability to:•incur additional indebtedness;•engage in sale and lease-back transactions;•create liens or other encumbrances;•enter into mergers, consolidations, liquidations or dissolutions, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;•create and acquire subsidiaries; and•pay dividends or make distributions on our and ITCTransmission’s capital stock and METC’s, ITC Midwest’s, and ITC Great Plains’ member capital.Our debt instruments also require us to meet certain financial ratios, such as maintaining certain debt to capitalization ratios. Our ability to comply with these and other requirements and restrictions may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions, results of operations or other events beyond our control. A failure to comply with the obligations contained in any of our debt instruments could result in acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.Adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us.Our ability to access capital markets is important to our ability to operate our business. Increased scrutiny of the energy industry and the impact of regulation, as well as changes in our financial performance and unfavorable conditions in the capital markets could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit ratings. A downgrade in our credit ratings could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs. A rating downgrade could also increase the interest we pay under our revolving and term loan credit agreements.Provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and bylaws, Michigan corporate law and our debt agreements may impede efforts by our shareholders to change the direction or management of our company.Our Articles of Incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a proposed takeover. These provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control or an acquisition at a price that our shareholders may find attractive. These provisions also may discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include:•a restriction limiting market participants from voting or owning 5% or more of the outstanding shares of our capital stock; •a requirement that special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our president or the holders of a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock;•advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations; and•the authority of our board to issue, without shareholder approval, common or preferred stock, including in connection with our implementation of any shareholders rights plan, or “poison pill.”In addition, our revolving and term loan credit agreements provide that a change in a majority of ITC Holdings’ board of directors that is not approved by the current ITC Holdings directors or acquiring beneficial ownership of 35% or more of ITC Holdings outstanding common shares will constitute a default under those agreements.22Table of ContentsProvisions in our Articles of Incorporation restrict market participants from voting or owning 5% or more of the outstanding shares of our capital stock.Certain of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries have been granted favorable rate treatment by the FERC based on their independence from market participants. The FERC defines a “market participant” to include any person or entity that, either directly or through an affiliate, sells or brokers electricity, or provides ancillary services to an RTO. An affiliate, for these purposes, includes any person or entity that directly or indirectly owns, controls or holds with the power to vote 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a market participant. To help ensure that we and our subsidiaries will remain independent of market participants, our Articles of Incorporation impose certain restrictions on the ownership and voting of shares of our capital stock by market participants. In particular, the Articles of Incorporation provide that we are restricted from issuing any shares of capital stock or recording any transfer of shares if the issuance or transfer would cause any market participant, either individually or together with members of its “group” (as defined in SEC beneficial ownership rules), to beneficially own 5% or more of any class or series of our capital stock. Additionally, if a market participant, together with its group members, acquires beneficial ownership of 5% or more of any series of the outstanding shares of our capital stock, such market participant or any shareholder who is a member of a group including a market participant will not be able to vote or direct or control the votes of shares representing 5% or more of any series of our outstanding capital stock. Finally, to the extent a market participant, together with its group members, acquires beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of any series of our capital stock, our Articles of Incorporation allow our board of directors to redeem any shares of our capital stock so that, after giving effect to the redemption, the market participant, together with its group members, will cease to beneficially own 5% or more of that series of our outstanding capital stock.Risks Related to the Entergy Transaction We may be unable to satisfy the conditions or obtain the approvals required to complete the Entergy Transaction or such approvals may contain material restrictions or conditions.The consummation of the Entergy Transaction is subject to numerous conditions, including (i) consummation of certain transactions and financings contemplated by the merger agreement and the separation agreement (such as the separation of Entergy’s transmission business from its distribution business), (ii) the receipt of ITC Holdings shareholder approval, and (iii) the receipt of certain regulatory approvals in a form that will not impose a burdensome condition on us or Entergy (as described in the merger agreement). We can make no assurances that the Entergy Transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. We have and will continue to expend management’s time and resources and incur expenses due to legal, advisory and financial services fees related to the Entergy Transaction. Governmental agencies may not approve the Entergy Transaction or the related transactions necessary to complete it, or may impose conditions to any such approval or require changes to the terms of the Entergy Transaction. Any such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the Entergy Transaction, imposing costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Entergy Transaction or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the Entergy Transaction. Any condition or change which results in a burdensome condition on Entergy’s transmission business and/or us under the merger agreement and might cause Entergy and/or us to restructure or terminate the Entergy Transaction or the related transactions.If completed, the Entergy Transaction may not be successful or achieve its anticipated benefits.If the Entergy Transaction is completed, we may not successfully realize anticipated growth opportunities or integrate our business and operations with the acquired transmission business and operations. After the Entergy Transaction, we will have significantly more revenue, expenses, assets and employees than we did prior to the Entergy Transaction. In the Entergy Transaction, we will also be assuming certain liabilities of Entergy's transmission business and taking on other obligations (including collective bargaining agreements and certain pension obligations with respect to transferred employees). We may not successfully or cost-effectively integrate the acquired transmission business and operations into our business and operations. Even if the combined company is able to integrate the transmission businesses and operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities that we currently expect from the Entergy Transaction within the anticipated time frame, or at all.23Table of ContentsThe merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us. The merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a business combination proposal to us prior to the closing of the Entergy Transaction that might result in greater value to ITC Holdings shareholders than the Entergy Transaction. The merger agreement generally prohibits us from soliciting any alternative acquisition proposal, although we may terminate the merger agreement in order to accept an unsolicited alternative transaction proposal that our board of directors determines is superior to the Entergy Transaction. In addition, before our board may withdraw or modify its recommendation or we may terminate the merger agreement to enter into a transaction that our board determines is superior to the Entergy Transaction, Entergy has the opportunity to negotiate with us to modify the terms of the Entergy Transaction in response to any competing acquisition proposals that may be made. If the merger agreement is terminated by us or Entergy in certain limited circumstances, we may be obligated to pay a termination fee to Entergy, which would represent an additional cost for a potential third party seeking a business combination with us. Failure to complete the Entergy Transaction could adversely affect the market price of ITC Holdings common stock as well as our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If the Entergy Transaction is not completed for any reason, the price of ITC Holdings common stock may decline to the extent that the market price of ITC Holdings common stock reflects positive market assumptions that the Entergy Transaction will be completed and the related benefits will be realized. In addition, significant expenses such as legal, advisory and financial services, many of which generally will be paid incurred regardless of whether the Entergy Transaction is completed, must be paid. Under the merger agreement, under certain limited circumstances, we must pay Entergy a termination fee.Investors holding shares of ITC Holdings common stock immediately prior to the completion of the Entergy Transaction will, in the aggregate, have a significantly reduced ownership and voting interest in us after the Entergy Transaction and will exercise less influence over management. Investors holding shares of ITC Holdings common stock immediately prior to the completion of the Entergy Transaction will, in the aggregate, own a significantly smaller percentage of the combined company immediately after the completion of the Entergy Transaction. Immediately following the completion of the Entergy Transaction, it is expected that Entergy shareholders will hold at least 50.1% of the ITC Holdings common stock on a fully diluted basis and existing ITC Holdings shareholders will hold no more than 49.9% of ITC Holdings common stock on a fully diluted basis (subject to adjustment in limited circumstances as provided in the merger agreement) and excluding any ITC equity awards issued to employees of the acquired business who become employees of our subsidiaries. In no event will Entergy shareholders hold less than 50.1% of our outstanding common stock immediately after the Entergy Transaction. Consequently, ITC Holdings shareholders, collectively, will be able to exercise less influence over the management and policies of the combined company than they are able to exercise over the management and our policies immediately prior to the completion of the Entergy Transaction.After the completion of the merger, sales of ITC Holdings common stock may negatively affect its market price.The shares of ITC Holdings common stock to be issued in the merger to Entergy shareholders will generally be eligible for immediate resale. The market price of ITC Holdings common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of ITC Holdings common stock in the market after the completion of the merger or the perception in the market that these sales could occur.Immediately following the completion of the merger, it is expected that former Entergy shareholders will hold approximately 50.1% of ITC Holdings' common stock on a fully diluted basis and existing ITC Holdings shareholders will hold approximately 49.9% of ITC Holdings' common stock on a fully diluted basis (subject to adjustment in limited circumstances as provided in the merger agreement and excluding any ITC Holdings equity awards issued to employees of Entergy's transmission business who become our employees). In no event will Entergy shareholders hold less than 50.1% of the outstanding common stock of ITC Holdings immediately after the merger. Certain former Entergy shareholders (such as certain index funds and institutional investors with specific investment guidelines that do not pertain to the stock of the combined company) who receive shares of ITC Holdings common stock pursuant to the merger agreement may be required to sell their shares of ITC Holdings common stock immediately after the merger, which may negatively affect the price of ITC Holdings' common stock following the merger.24Table of ContentsWe are required to abide by potentially significant restrictions which could limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions (such as the issuance of ITC Holdings common stock or the undertaking of a merger or consolidation) that otherwise could be advantageous. The merger agreement and the separation agreement impose certain ongoing restrictions on us to ensure that applicable statutory requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and applicable Treasury regulations are met so that the Entergy Transaction qualifies as tax-free to Entergy and its shareholders. As a result of these restrictions, our ability to engage in certain transactions, such as the redemption of ITC Holdings common stock or the issuance of our equity securities (subject to certain exceptions generally relating to compensation) may be limited until two years and one day following the closing of the Entergy Transaction (excluding the $700 million recapitalization in the form of a one-time special dividend and/or share repurchase to be completed in connection with the Entergy Transaction). If we take any of an enumerated list of actions and omissions that would cause the Entergy Transaction to become taxable, we generally will be required to bear the cost of any resulting tax liability. If the Entergy Transaction became taxable, Entergy would be expected to recognize a substantial amount of income, which would result in a material amount of taxes. Any such taxes allocated to us would be expected to be material to us, and could cause our business, financial condition and operating results to suffer. These restrictions may reduce our ability to engage in certain business transactions that otherwise might be advantageous to us.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.None.
