D. Risk FactorsThe dividends we receive from our PRC subsidiary and our global income may be subject to PRC tax under the new EIT law, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations; our foreign ADS holders may be subject to a PRC withholding tax upon the dividends payable by us and upon gains realized on the sale of our ADSs, if we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise. Borrowings We had short-term and long-term borrowings due within one year of $248.6 million, $267.4 million and $158.7 million as of December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010. Our short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 bore an average interest rate of 7.11%, 5.14% and 4.04%, respectively. In connection with most of our short-term borrowings, we have either sought guarantees by third parties or granted security interests over significant amounts of our assets. With respect to encumbrances, as of December 31, 2010, we pledged our equipment of a total appraised value of RMB1,244.9 million ($188.0 million) to secure repayment of our borrowings of RMB513.0 million ($77.5 million). We had $14.6 million, $182.5 million and $300.0 million of long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. In 2009, we obtained a five-year credit facility of approximately $303.3 million with a syndicate of five PRC banks led by the Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China. As of December 31, 2010, we had drawn down $275.1 million under the facility. In January 2010, we entered into a 15-year credit facility with China Development Bank under which we can draw down up to 100.0 million ($133.0 million) within one year commencing in March 2010. The facility will expire in March 2025 and bears an interest rate of the six-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate plus 3%. As of December 31, 2010, we had drawn down 50.0 million under the facility. We have historically been able to repay our total borrowings as they became due mostly from cash from operations and proceeds from short-term and long-term borrowings. We may also seek additional debt or equity financing to repay the remaining portion of our borrowings. As we continue to ramp up our current and planned operations in order to complete our vertical integration and expansion strategies, we also expect to generate cash from our expanded operations to repay a portion of our borrowings. In July 2008, we completed an offering of $138 million of 4% convertible senior notes. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the life of the convertible senior notes using the interest method. Holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on July 15, 2011 or upon certain change in control events. As such, we classified the notes as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010. The notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity, which is on July 15, 2013, unless previously redeemed at the option of the holders into our ADSs at a conversion price of $16.94 per ADS, subject to certain adjustments. We used the net proceeds received from the offering to expand our manufacturing lines for the production of silicon ingots, wafers, solar cells and solar modules, to purchase raw materials and other general corporate purposes. In connection with the senior convertible senior notes offering, we also offered 4,073,194 ADSs in an ADS borrowing facility. The ADS borrower will be required to return the borrowed ADSs by the scheduled maturity date of the notes in July 2013. 79 Table of Contents In June 2009, we secured from Standard Chartered Bank (China) Limited revolving credit facilities totaling approximately $57 million, consisting of trade financing and hedge products. The facilities are aimed to provide financial support to our raw material procurement and product sales while helping us mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with market volatilities. In July 2009, we secured loans of approximately $80 million due on June 30, 2010 from a domestic bank to support our East Campus capacity expansion project. The loans were denominated in Euros, U.S. dollars and Renminbi and bore annual interest rates linked to LIBOR for Euros denominated loan and U.S. dollar denominated loan and the basic one-year borrowing rate of the Peoples Bank of China for Renminbi denominated loan. These loans subsequently became part of a five-year syndicated loan facility we secured in September 2009 to support our East Campus capacity expansion project. In September 2009, Trina China entered into a five-year credit facility of approximately $303.3 million, consisting of RMB1,524.6 million Renminbi denominated loan and $80.0 million U.S. dollar denominated loan, with a syndicate of five PRC banks led by the Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China. Approximately $269.2 million of the facility are designated solely for the expansion of our production capacity, with the remaining to be used to supplement working capital requirements once the capacity expansion is completed. The facility can be drawn down either in Renminbi or U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2010, we had drawn down approximately $275.1 million under the facility. The remaining facility to supplement working capital requirements can only be drawn on or after the date of completion of capacity expansion. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings under the facility was 5.53% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Interest is payable quarterly or biannually in arrears for loans denominated in Renminbi and U.S. dollars, respectively. Interest rate applied for Renminbi-denominated borrowings is the same interest rate stipulated by Chinese central bank plus 10%. U.S.-dollar denominated borrowings are subject to the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate plus 3%. The facility is guaranteed by Trina and Mr. Jifan Gao, our chairman and chief executive officer, and his wife, Ms. Chunyan Wu, and is collateralized by the property, plant and equipment of the project and the related land-use right. Borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2010 are payable on a biannual basis, commencing on October 27, 2011. For purposes of the expansion, we are required to match draw-downs from the facility with an equal amount of cash from sources other than the facility. The terms of facility also contain financial covenants which, among other things, require us to maintain a debt-asset ratio of no more than 0.60, a net profit ratio of not less than zero percent and an interest coverage ratio of greater than 2. In January 2010, Trina Solar (Luxembourg) S.à.r.l., or Trina Luxembourg, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a 15-year credit facility with China Development Bank under which Trina Luxembourg can draw down up to 100 million within one year commencing in March 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we had drawn down approximatedly US$66.5 million under the facility. The facility will expire in March 2025. The interest rate for borrowings drawn under this facility is the six-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate plus 3%. The repayment of the credit facility is guaranteed by Trina China. Trina Luxembourg can only use the proceeds of a draw down to finance its business activities associated with certain downstream projects in Europe. We are required to obtain approval from the lender if Trina Luxembourg or Trina China disposes its assets or provides guarantees with a significant amount. 80 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures We had capital expenditures of $165.4 million, $136.5 million and $164.8 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Our capital expenditures were used primarily to purchase equipment for the production of ingots, wafers, cells and modules. We expect our capital expenditures to increase in the future as we expand our solar module business. We estimate that our capital expenditures in 2011 will be approximately $380.0 million for manufacturing capacity expansion. As of December 31, 2010, we had an annual manufacturing capacity of ingots and wafers of approximately 750 MW and cells and modules of approximately 1,200 MW. We plan to increase our annual manufacturing capacity of ingots and wafers to approximately 1,200 MW and cells and modules to approximately 1,900 MW in the second half of 2011. The specific increase will be based on market visibility in both customer demand and the commercial lending environment to finance PV system installations in our respective sales markets. We are implementing a strategy to focus on preserving cash, which includes reducing costs and reviewing and taking a prudent approach to our capital expansion plan. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will not revise our capacity expansion plan after we finalize our review. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 81 Table of Contents In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29, Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations. This ASU specifies that if a public company presents comparative financial statements, the entity should only disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. ASU 2010-29 is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2010-29 will not impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, as its requirements only pertain to financial statement footnote disclosure. C. Research and Development We focus our research and development efforts towards improving our ingot, wafer, solar cell and solar module manufacturing capabilities. We seek to reduce manufacturing costs and improve the performance of our products. As of December 31, 2010, we had a total of 343 employees involved in our research and development activities. Among them, 69 employees are under our technology development department and are dedicated to research and development. We also have a team of 274 employees under our engineering department and responsible for manufacturing technology development and further fine-tuning our production processes. Our research and development department is divided into teams responsible for research in each stage of the solar power product value chain, such as ingot, wafer, solar cell and module production and system integration. We also have a technology committee, which meets regularly to review current development progress and identify new research and development areas. Our technology committee is spearheaded by our senior management and is comprised of both our employees and external solar energy experts. Our research and development efforts will be further enhanced by our currently under construction R&D Laboratory in the PV Park, a research and development center that focuses on developing PV technologies, including utilization of alternative materials, increasing cell conversion efficiencies and conducting assembly and system research, and to conduct technology exchanges with PV experts from world leading companies, research institutes and emerging technology companies. We have also formed a world-class academic committee dedicated to creating a technology platform for the development of photovoltaic technologies. We are one of the two solar companies in China commissioned by the PRC government to establish and operate research and development centers. Our research efforts are currently focused on four main product areas, namely ingots, wafers, solar cells and solar modules. We focus on improving cell efficiency and reducing our production costs by enhancing manufacturing yields, which enable us to deliver higher-efficiency products at a lower cost. Our research and development efforts range from leveraging on declining raw material costs to optimize silicon feedstock mix to enhancing the quality of our solar wafers and refining ingot growing and wafer slicing processes. In the fourth quarter of 2010, our average silicon usage was approximately 5.9 grams per watt, compared to approximately 6.0 and 6.3 grams per watt in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively. Currently, we slice monocrystalline and multicrystalline wafers to a 180 micron thickness, while maintaining a low breakage rate. 82 Table of Contents For the assembly of modules, our research and development team works closely with our manufacturing team and customers to improve our solar module and system designs. We have designed products with specific applications. We have developed a variety of PV solar power product applications based on our existing monocrystalline and multicrystalline technologies. These products include architecturally-friendly modules of different colors, shapes and sizes, such as black modules, square modules and large-size modules. In April 2010, we announced our new utility-scale TSM-PC14 solar module, our most powerful module to date with expected power output targets ranging from 265 W to 290 W. We have invested significantly in research and development of solar cell technology in order to achieve high conversion efficiency rates required for our advanced solar cells and modules. We achieved conversion efficiencies of up to 19.5% in monocrystalline solar cells and 18.0% in multicrystalline solar cells in 2010 on a test production line basis, and plan to increase the efficiencies to up to 18.5% in multicrystalline solar cells on a test production line basis by the end of 2011. In June 2010, we announced our research agreement with Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore to develop an all-back-contact high-efficiency silicon wafer solar cell using our monocrystalline wafers. We have a team of 29 employees dedicated to the development and implementation of this process technology. We also plan to make additional efforts to realize the technical and cost synergies of having in-house vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities. In each of the three years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, our research and development expenditures were $3.0 million, $5.4 million and $18.6 million, representing 0.4%, 0.6% and 1.0% of our total revenues for 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. We will continue to expand and promote innovation in our process technologies of manufacturing ingots, wafers, cells and PV modules. Accordingly, we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we hire additional research and development personnel and advance our research and development projects. D.
