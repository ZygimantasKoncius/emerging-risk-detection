For further information regarding our risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report. ITEM 1. BUSINESS. In General NVE Corporation, referred to as NVE, we, us, or our, develops and sells devices that use spintronics, a nanotechnology that relies on electron spin rather than electron charge to acquire, store and transmit information. We manufacture high-performance spintronic products including sensors and couplers that are used to acquire and transmit data. We have also licensed our spintronic magnetoresistive random access memory technology, commonly known as MRAM. NVE History and Background NVE is a Minnesota corporation headquartered in a suburb of Minneapolis. We were founded in 1989 by James M. Daughton, Ph.D., a recognized pioneer in spintronics. Our common stock became publicly traded in 2000 through a reverse merger and became NASDAQ listed in 2003. Since our founding, we have been awarded more than $50 million in government research contracts, including more than 30 MRAM development contracts. These contracts have helped us build our intellectual property portfolio. Over the years our product sales have increased and we have reduced our dependence on research contracts. Fiscal years referenced in this report end March 31. Industry Background Much of the electronics industry is devoted to the acquisition, storage, and transmission of information. We have focused on three applications for our spintronic technology: magnetic sensors, couplers, and memories. Sensors acquire information, couplers transmit information, and memories store information. In that sense, our technology can provide the eyes, nerves, and brains of electronic systems. Magnetic sensors can be used for a number of purposes including detecting the position or speed of robotics and mechanisms, or for communicating with implantable medical devices. We believe our spintronic sensors are smaller, more precise, and more reliable than competing devices. Couplers are widely used in factory automation, providing reliable digital communication between electronic subsystems in factories. For example, couplers are used to send data between robots and central controllers at very high speed. As manufacturing automation expands, there is a need for higher speed data and more channel density. Because of their unique properties, we believe our couplers transmit more data at higher speeds and over longer distances than conventional devices. Near-term potential MRAM applications include mission-critical storage such as military, industrial, and anti-tamper applications. As its density increases and cost per bit decreases, MRAM could replace semiconductor memories in cellphones, computers, and other electronic devices enabling smaller, faster, and more power-efficient electronics. Our Enabling Technology Our designs are generally based on either giant magnetoresistance or tunneling magnetoresistance. These structures produce a large change in electrical resistance depending on the electron spin orientation in a free layer. 3 Table of Contents In giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices, resistance changes due to conduction electrons scattering at interfaces within the devices. The GMR effect is only significant if the layer thicknesses are less than the mean free path of conduction electrons, which is approximately five nanometers. Our critical GMR conductor layers may be less than two nanometers, or five atomic layers, thick. Technological advances in recent years have made it practical to manufacture such small dimensions. The second type of spintronic structure we use is based on tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR). Such devices are known as Spin-Dependent Tunnel (SDT) junctions, Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), or Tunneling Magnetic Junctions (TMJs). SDT junctions use tunnel barriers that are so thin that electrons can tunnel through a normally insulating material to cause a resistance change. SDT barrier thicknesses can be in the range of one to four nanometers (less than ten molecules). In our products, the spintronic elements are connected to integrated circuitry and packaged in much the same way as conventional integrated circuits. Our Strategy Our vision is to become the leading developer of practical spintronics technology and devices. We plan to do that by selling the products described below and licensing our MRAM technology. To grow product sales, we plan to broaden our sensor and coupler product lines, and longer-term to target larger markets such as consumer electronics. Our Products and Markets We operate in one reportable segment. For financial information concerning this segment see Note 8  Segment Information of the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. Sensor Products and Markets Our sensor products detect the presence of a magnet or metal to determine position or speed. The GMR changes its electrical resistance depending on the magnetic field. In our devices, GMR is combined with conventional foundry integrated circuitry and packaged in much the same way as conventional integrated circuits. We sell standard or catalog sensors, and custom sensors designed to meet customers exact requirements. Our sensors are quite small, very sensitive to magnetic fields, precise, and reliable. Standard sensors Our standard, or catalog, sensors are generally used to detect the presence of a magnetic or metallic material to determine position or speed. We believe our spintronic sensors are smaller, more precise, and more reliable than competing devices. Our major market for standard sensors is factory automation. Custom and medical sensors Our primary custom products are sensors for medical devices, which are customized to our customers requirements and manufactured under stringent medical device quality standards. Most are used to replace electromechanical magnetic switches. We believe our sensors have important advantages in medical devices compared to electromechanical switches, including no moving parts for inherent reliability, and being smaller, more sensitive, and more precise. Our sensors can be customized using customer-specific integrated signal processing and design variations that can include the range and sensitivity to magnetic fields, electrical resistance, and multi-sensor elements configuration. Future custom sensor target markets include consumer and automotive electronics. Coupler Products and Markets Our spintronic couplers combine a GMR sensor element and an IsoLoop integrated microscopic coil. The coil creates a small magnetic field that is picked up by the spintronic sensor, transmitting data almost instantly. Couplers are also known as isolators because they electrically isolate the coupled systems. Our IsoLoop couplers are much faster than the fastest optical couplers. We have four lines of coupler products: IL600-Series passive-input couplers; IL700/IL200-Series digital-input couplers; new, cost-effective IL500-Series couplers; and IL400/IL3000-Series isolated network signal couplers. MRAM Products and Markets MRAM uses spintronics to store data, combining the speed of semiconductor memory with the nonvolatility of magnetic disk drives. MRAM is inherently nonvolatile, meaning the data remains even if power is removed. MRAM has been called the ideal or universal memory because it has the potential to combine the speed of SRAM, the density of DRAM, and the nonvolatility of flash memory. Data is stored in the spin of the electrons in thin metal alloy films, and read with spin-dependent tunnel junctions. Unlike electrical charge, the spin of an electron is inherently permanent. In MRAMs, the spin of the electrons is set with tiny bursts of energy. We have invented several types of MRAM memory cells and modes of operation. 4 Table of Contents Advanced MRAM designs that we are developing or have developed include Vertical transport MRAM (also known as VMRAM), magnetothermal MRAM, and spin-momentum transfer MRAM. We believe such design approaches have the potential to increase the scalability of MRAM. In the near term, MRAM could replace battery-backed-up SRAMs in mission-critical systems such as military, factory control, point-of-sale terminals, and gaming electronics. MRAM has the potential advantages of being simpler, lower cost, and more reliable than battery/memory systems. Long term, MRAM could address the market for ubiquitous high-density memory. Product Manufacturing Our fabrication facility is a clean-room area with specialized equipment to deposit, pattern, etch, and process spintronic materials. Most of our products are fabricated in our facility using either raw wafers or foundry wafers. Foundry wafers contain conventional electronics that perform housekeeping functions such as voltage regulation and signal conditioning in our products. Each wafer may include thousands of devices. We build spintronics structures on wafers in our fabrication facility. We either saw wafers to be sold in die form, or wafers are sent to Asia for dicing and packaging. Packaged parts are returned to us to be tested, inventoried, and shipped. Sales and Product Distribution We rely on distributors who stock and sell our products in more than 75 countries. Distributors of our products include two of the largest electronic component distributors in the world: Digi-Key Corporation and the Premier Farnell Group. Our distributor agreements generally renew annually. In addition, Avago Technologies, a leading supplier of solid-state couplers, distributes private-branded versions of some of our couplers under an agreement that expires in June 2010. New Product Status In the past year we began marketing several new products including:  the IL500-Series of lower-priced spintronic couplers;  integrated spintronic current sensors; and  tunneling magnetoresistance angle sensors. Our Competition Industrial Sensor Competition A limited number of other companies claim to either make or have the capability to make GMR and TMR sensors. Also, several competitors make solid-state industrial magnetic sensors including silicon Hall-effect sensors and anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) sensors. We believe those types of sensors are not as sensitive as our GMR or TMR sensors. Medical Sensor Competition Our sensors for medical devices face competition from other solid-state magnetic sensors and from electromechanical magnetic sensors. Compared to other solid-state magnetic sensors, we believe our medical sensors have small size, high sensitivity to small magnetic fields, simpler electrical interfaces, and inherent reliability. Electromechanical magnetic sensors such as reed switches have been in use for several decades. Electromechanical competitors include Hermetic Switch, Inc., Meder Electronic AG (Engen/Welschingen, Germany), and Memscap SA (Grenoble, France). Because our sensors have no moving parts, we believe they are inherently more reliable than electromechanical magnetic sensors. We also believe our sensors are smaller than the smallest electromechanical magnetic sensors, more precise in their magnetic switch points, and more sensitive. Coupler Competition Competing digital coupler technologies include optical couplers, inductive couplers (transformers), and capacitive couplers. In addition to being a customer, Avago is a leading producer of high-speed optical couplers. Other prominent optical coupler suppliers are Fairchild Semiconductor International, NEC Corporation, Sharp Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, and Vishay Intertechnology. We believe our couplers are faster and have longer life than optical couplers. Inductive couplers are made by a number of companies including Analog Devices, Inc. and Silicon Laboratories Inc. Unlike our IsoLoop couplers, inductive couplers require special encoding to transmit logic signals. Furthermore, IsoLoop couplers require much less board space than most optical or inductive couplers. MEMS inductive couplers are smaller than other inductive couplers, but we believe our devices generally have higher channel density per area, higher speed, less signal distortion, and generate less noise. Manufacturers of capacitive couplers include Texas Instruments Incorporated. We believe we have a broader product line and higher channel density than is available for capacitive couplers. 5 Table of Contents We make a number of isolated network signal couplers that combine spintronics coupling with network protocol functions, such as RS-485 (also known as TIA-485 or EIA-485), in a single package. Competitive network signal couplers are available from Analog Devices; Linear Technology Corporation; Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.; and Texas Instruments. Based on a comparison of published specifications, we believe our devices have speed, miniaturization, and product-line breadth advantages over other network signal couplers. MRAM Competition Most currently available memories are volatile, meaning data is lost when power is removed. Memories in this category include dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and static random access memory (SRAM). MRAM has the potential to match or exceed the speed of such memories without the volatility. Currently available nonvolatile memories include flash memory and ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM). MRAM is potentially faster and uses less power than existing nonvolatile memories. Furthermore, existing nonvolatile memories can be written only a limited number of times before they wear out, while MRAM has virtually unlimited life. Additionally, flash memory may be subject to scalability limitations that could limit its density in coming years. We do not believe MRAM is subject to those limitations. Battery-backed-up SRAM uses stored energy to preserve data after the main power has been removed. We believe that MRAM has the potential of being simpler, lower cost, and more reliable than battery-backed-up SRAM. Battery-backed-up SRAM manufacturers include Maxim. Emerging technologies competing with MRAM include carbon nanotubes, phase-change memory (PCM; also known as PRAM, chalcogenide, CRAM, or Ovonic memory), and resistive RAM (RRAM). We believe that MRAM has advantages over these technologies in either manufacturability, speed, or endurance. Companies developing carbon nanotube memory include Nantero, Inc. , a number of companies are developing PCM, and several memory makers have been reported to be involved in RRAM research. Other companies that may compete with us for MRAM research and development or service business, or that may be attempting to develop MRAM intellectual property with the intention of licensing to others include Crocus Technology SA (Grenoble, France), Grandis, Inc., MagSil Corporation, Spintec (Grenoble, France), Spintron (Marseille, France), and Spintronics Plc (London, UK). Principal Suppliers and Raw Materials Our principal suppliers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers that are incorporated into our products. These include Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation of Shanghai (China); Intersil Corporation; ON Semiconductor Corporation; Silicon Quest International, Inc.; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation; Texas Instruments Incorporated; and X-FAB Silicon Foundries Group. Other companies provide device packaging services, including Circuit Electronics Industries (Ayutthaya, Thailand); United Test and Assembly Center Ltd. (Singapore); and SPEL Semiconductor Limited (Chennai, India). Intellectual Property Patents We were granted five U.S. patents assigned to us in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. As of March 31, 2009 we had a total of 50 issued U.S. patents assigned to us. We also have a number of foreign patents, a number of U.S. and foreign patents pending, and we have licensed patents from others. Our technology is protected by more than 100 patents worldwide either issued, pending or licensed from others. We are continuing to develop inventions and expect to add to our patent portfolio. There are no patents we regard as critical to our business owned by us or licensed to us that expire in the next 12 months. Much of our intellectual property has been developed with U.S. Government support. Under federal legislation, companies normally may retain the principal worldwide patent rights to any invention developed with U.S. Government support. Certain of our patents cover MRAM cells with transistor selection for data retrieval, which we believe may be necessary for successful high-density, high-performance MRAMs. We believe our 6,275,411 and 6,349,053 U.S. patents, both titled Spin Dependent Tunneling Memory, are particularly important. Both patents cover MRAMs using arrays of Spin Dependent Tunnel Junctions. Based on their public disclosures, we believe several companies are pursuing the approach described in these patents. The 6,275,411 patent expires in 2019 and the 6,349,053 patent expires in 2021. We also have patents on advanced MRAM designs that we believe are important, including patents that relate to magnetothermal MRAM, spin-momentum MRAM, and synthetic antiferromagnetic storage. Trademarks NVE and IsoLoop are our registered trademarks. Other trademarks include GMR Switch and GT Sensor. 6 Table of Contents Licenses We have licensed certain of our MRAM intellectual property to several companies, including Cypress, Honeywell, and Motorola, Inc. Agreements with Honeywell We have agreements and amendments to agreements with Honeywell dating back approximately to our founding. Under these agreements we are not required to pay royalties to Honeywell for the use of their intellectual property, and Honeywell has intellectual property rights to certain of our earlier-developed MRAM technology. Motorola License We granted Motorola a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-assignable license to our MRAM intellectual property and received advance payments in conjunction with the agreement. Motorola has since separated Freescale. Motorola and Freescale asked us to consent to Motorolas assignment of the Patent License Option Agreement to Freescale. We have declined to provide such consent without additional consideration. We believe the Motorola agreement likely terminated in 2005 because Motorola transferred manufacturing to Freescale. Freescale since announced the formation of an independent company to take ownership of Freescales MRAM manufacturing assets. Royalty Agreement We have licensed rights to another organizations GMR-related patent family, and that agreement calls for us to pay royalties on our sales of certain products. Payments under this agreement have been less than $5,000 for each of the most recent three fiscal years. The agreement remains in force until the expiration of the last patent, which we believe will be June 14, 2009. Other Licenses We have a technology exchange agreement with Cypress Semiconductor Corporation. None of the rights we have under this agreement are currently important to our business. Working Capital Items Like other companies in the electronics industry, we have historically invested in capital equipment for manufacturing and testing our products, as well as research and development equipment. We have also deployed significant capital in inventories to have our products available from stock, to receive more favorable pricing for raw materials, and to guard against raw material shortages. Major Customers We rely on several customers for a large percentage of our revenue. These include: Avago Technologies; Phonak AG; St. Jude Medical, Inc.; Starkey Laboratories, Inc.; the U.S. Government; and certain distributors. The loss of any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on us. For the purposes of this disclosure, all agencies of the U.S. Government are considered a single customer. Backlog As of March 31, 2009 we had $2,198,545 of contract research and development backlog we believed to be firm, compared to $898,101 as of March 31, 2008. We expect most of the firm backlog as of March 31, 2009 to be filled in fiscal 2010. Approximately 53% of our backlog as of March 31, 2009 and 96% as of March 31, 2008 was from agencies of the U.S. Government. U.S. Government orders that are not yet funded, or contracts awarded but not yet signed, are not included in firm backlog. The portion of orders already included in operating revenues on the basis of percentage of completion or program accounting are excluded. We do not believe any material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. Government. There can be no assurance, however, of additional contracts or follow-on contracts for expired or completed U.S. Government contracts. We do not believe product sales backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results. Our product sales are made primarily under standard purchase orders. We have certain agreements that require customers to forecast purchases; however, these agreements do not generally obligate the customer to purchase any particular quantity of products. Shipment schedules and quantities actually purchased by customers are often revised to reflect changes in customers needs. Based on semiconductor industry practice and our experience, we do not believe that such agreements are meaningful for determining backlog amounts. We believe that only a small portion of our product order backlog is non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant. Seasonality In each of the three most recent fiscal years, our product sales have been less in quarters ended December 31 than the immediately preceding or subsequent quarters. This may have been due in part to distributor ordering patterns or customer vacations and shutdowns late in calendar years. We do not know if this pattern will continue. 7 Table of Contents Research and Development Activities We spent $966,610 for fiscal 2009, $1,202,504 for fiscal 2008, and $1,789,844 for fiscal 2007 in company-sponsored research and development activities. Over the past three fiscal years these activities have included development of new sensors and couplers, and lower-cost product designs. Additionally, we spent $3,085,726 during fiscal 2009, $2,139,059 during fiscal 2008, and $2,090,200 during fiscal 2007 on customer-sponsored research and development contract activities. These research and development contracts were with various agencies of the U.S. Government as well as with other companies. Government Regulations We are subject to various local, state, and federal laws, regulations and agencies that affect businesses generally. These include regulations promulgated by federal and state environmental and health agencies, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and laws pertaining to the hiring, treatment, safety, and discharge of employees. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Number of Employees We had 50 employees as of March 31, 2009 and 2008. Increased manufacturing productivity allowed us to increase our revenue per employee for the year ended March 31, 2009. Our employment can fluctuate due to a variety of factors. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe we maintain good relations with our employees. Financial Information About Geographical Areas International sales accounted for approximately 47% of our revenue in fiscal 2009, 47% in fiscal 2008, and 40% in fiscal 2007. More information about geographical areas is contained in Note 8  Segment Information of the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. Environmental Matters We are subject to environmental laws and regulations, particularly with respect to industrial waste. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Available Information All reports we file with the SEC, including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and proxy statements on Schedule 14A, as well as any amendments to those reports, are accessible at no cost through the Investors section of our Website (www.nve.com). These filings are also accessible through the SECs Website (www.sec.gov). ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. We caution readers that the following important factors, among others, could affect our financial condition, operating results, business prospects or any other aspect of NVE, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from that projected or estimated by us in the forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. Although we have attempted to list below the important factors that do or may affect our financial condition, operating results, business prospects, or any other aspect of NVE, other factors may in the future prove to be more important. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Similarly, we cannot necessarily assess or quantify the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Risks Related to Our Business We may lose revenue if any of our large customers cancel, postpone, or reduce their purchases. We rely on several large customers for a large percentage of our revenue. These large customers include Avago Technologies; Phonak AG; St. Jude Medical, Inc.; Starkey Laboratories, Inc.; the U.S. Government; and certain distributors. Orders from these large customers could be canceled, postponed, or reduced, and the loss of any of these customers could have a significant impact on our revenue and our profitability. We may lose revenue if we are unable to renew agreements with large customers. Our Supplier Partnering Agreement with St. Jude Medical expires December 31, 2009, the agreement between Avago Technologies, Inc. and us, as amended, expires June 26, 2010, and our Phonak AG Supply Agreement expires May 1, 2012. We cannot predict if any of these agreements will be renewed, or if renewed, under what terms. The inability to agree on mutually acceptable terms or the loss of any of these large customers could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and our profitability. 8 Table of Contents We will lose revenue if government contract funding is reduced or eliminated. Although our revenue from agencies of the U.S. Government was less than 10% of our total revenue in fiscal 2009, a material decrease in U.S. Government funding research or disqualification as a vendor to the U.S. Government for any reason would likely hamper future research and development activity and decrease related revenue. In addition to direct U.S. Government funding, certain of our non-Government customers depend on Government support to fund their contracts with us. U.S. Government funding is dependent upon adequate continued funding of the agencies and their programs. Changes in policy by the new U.S. presidential administration or new U.S. Congress could affect government spending priorities. Government spending priorities over which we have no control, such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, may affect availability of U.S. Government funds. Furthermore, a significant portion of our U.S. Government funding is through Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts. SBIR budgets may be changed by legislation or by agencies such as the Department of Defense. Failure to qualify as a small business under federal regulations could make us ineligible for some government-funded research contracts, which could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and our ability to make research and development progress. We received approximately $1.44 million in Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract awards in fiscal 2009. Federal regulations place a number of criteria for a business to be eligible to compete for SBIR awards. Those criteria currently include number of employees and ownership structure. While we believe we meet the eligibility criteria, changes in our ownership beyond our control could cause us to lose our eligibility to compete for SBIR awards, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profits, and research and development efforts. In addition, SBIR eligibility requirements could be changed at any time. Our backlog may not result in future revenue. While we evaluate each order to determine qualification for inclusion in our firm backlog, there can be no assurance that amounts included in our firm backlog ultimately will result in future revenue. A reduction in our firm backlog during any particular period, or the failure of our firm backlog to result in future revenue, could harm our business and revenue. We face an uncertain economic environment in the industries we serve, which could adversely affect our business. A significant portion of our product sales are into industries affected by the current worldwide economic downturn. This downturn has resulted in a significant decrease in the semiconductor market, which is the primary market for our products. Industries we serve that have been affected by the economic downturn include industrial control, factory automation, scientific instruments, and certain medical industries. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery, worldwide or in the industries we serve. A material adverse impact on our business and revenue is likely if the economy or industries we serve do not improve from their present levels. Our reputation could be damaged and we could lose revenue if we fail to meet technical challenges required to produce marketable products. Our products use new technology and we are continually researching and developing product designs and production processes. Our production processes require control of magnetic and other parameters that are not required in conventional semiconductor processes. If we are unable to develop stable designs and production processes, we may not be able to produce products that meet our customers requirements, which could cause damage to our reputation and loss of revenue. Our failure to meet stringent customer technical requirements could result in the loss of key customers and potentially reduce our sales. Some of our customers, including Avago Technologies, Phonak AG, St. Jude Medical, and Starkey Laboratories, have stringent technical requirements which require our products to pass certain test and qualification criteria before they are accepted by such customers. Failure to meet those criteria could result in the loss of current sales revenue, customers, and future sales. Our sensors are incorporated into medical devices, which could expose us to a risk of product liability claims and such claims could seriously harm our business and financial condition. Certain of our sensor products are used in medical devices, including devices that help sustain human life. We are also marketing our sensor technology to other manufacturers of cardiac pacemakers and ICDs. Although we have indemnification agreements with certain customers with provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses resulting from bodily injury or property damage arising from the incorporation of our products in devices sold by our customers. Existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could limit or invalidate the provisions of our indemnification agreements, or the agreements may not be enforceable in all instances. A successful product liability claim could require us to pay, or contribute to payment of, substantial damage awards, which would have a significant negative effect on our business and financial condition. 9 Table of Contents Federal legislation may not protect us against liability for the use of our sensors in medical devices and a successful liability claim could seriously harm our business and financial condition. Although the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1998 may provide us some protection against potential liability claims, that Act includes significant exceptions to supplier immunity provisions, including limitations relating to negligence or willful misconduct. A successful product liability claim could require us to pay, or contribute to payment of, substantial damage awards, which would have a significant negative effect on our business and financial condition. Any product liability claim against us, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, divert the time, attention, and resources of our management and have a material adverse impact on our business. Any malfunction of our sensors in existing medical devices could lead to the need to recall devices incorporating our sensors from the market, which may be harmful to our reputation and cause a significant loss of revenue. Any malfunction of our sensors could lead to the need to recall existing medical devices incorporating our sensors from the market, which may be harmful to our reputation because it is dependent on product safety and efficacy. Even if assertions that our sensors caused or contributed to device failure do not lead to product liability or contract claims, such assertions could harm our reputation and our customer relationships. Any damage to our reputation and/or the reputation of our products, or the reputation of our customers or their products could limit the market for our and our customers products and harm our results of operations. We may lose business and revenue if our critical production equipment fails. Our production process relies on certain critical pieces of equipment for defining, depositing, and modifying the magnetic properties of very thin metal films. Some of this equipment was designed or customized by us, and some may no longer be in production. While we have an in-house maintenance staff, maintenance agreements for certain equipment, some critical spare parts, and back-ups for some of the equipment, we cannot be sure we could repair or replace critical manufacturing equipment were it to fail. The loss of supply from any of our key single-source wafer suppliers could impact our ability to produce and deliver products and cause loss of revenue. Our critical suppliers include suppliers of certain raw silicon and semiconductor wafers that are incorporated in our products. We maintain inventory of some critical wafers, but we have not identified or qualified alternate suppliers for many of the wafers now being obtained from single sources. Any supply interruptions could seriously jeopardize our ability to provide products that are critical to our business and operations and may cause us to lose revenue. The loss of supply of any critical chemicals or supplies could impact our ability to produce and deliver products and cause loss of revenue. There are a number of critical chemicals and supplies that we require to make products. These include certain photoresists, polymers, metals, and alloys. We maintain inventory of critical chemicals and materials, but in many cases we are dependent on single sources, and some of the materials could be discontinued by their suppliers at any time. Any supply interruptions could seriously jeopardize our ability to provide products that are critical to our business and operations and may cause us to lose revenue. The loss of supply from any of our single-source packaging vendors could impact our ability to produce and deliver products and cause loss of revenue. We are dependent on our packaging vendors including Circuit Electronic Industries Public Co., Ltd. (CEI) of Ayutthaya, Thailand. Some of our products use processes or tooling unique to a particular packaging vendor, and it might be expensive, time-consuming, or impractical to convert to another vendor in the event of a supply interruption. CEI has been operating under voluntary debt rehabilitation under Thailand law since 2005. We have identified potential alternate vendors for our most important products in case CEIs ability to serve our needs becomes impaired, but it could prove expensive, time-consuming, or technically challenging to convert to an alternate vendor. If one of our packaging vendors were to become insolvent we might not be able to recover work in process or finished goods in their possession. Any supply interruptions or loss of inventory could seriously jeopardize our ability to provide products that are critical to our business and operations and may cause us to lose revenue. We are subject to risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries that could impair our results of operations. Foreign sales were approximately 47% of our revenue for fiscal 2009, and we expect foreign sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue in the future. Furthermore, we rely on suppliers in China, India, Taiwan, Thailand, and other foreign countries. Risks relating to or arising from operating in foreign markets that could impair our results of operations include economic and political instability; changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, customs, duties, and other trade barriers; transportation delays; acts of God, including floods, typhoons, and earthquakes; and other uncertainties relating to the administration of, or changes in, or new interpretation of, the laws, regulations, and policies of the jurisdictions where we do business. 10 Table of Contents Because we are significantly smaller than the many of our competitors, we may lack the financial resources needed to increase our market share and future revenue. Our known product competitors include Avago Technologies; Analog Devices, Inc.; Fairchild Semiconductor International; Hermetic Switch, Inc.; Linear Technology Inc.; Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.; Meder Electronic AG; Memscap SA; NEC Corporation; Sharp Corporation; Silicon Laboratories, Inc.; Texas Instruments Incorporated; Toshiba Corporation; Vishay Intertechnology; and others. Many of our competitors and potential competitors are established companies that have significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than us. We believe that our competition is increasing as the technology matures. This has meant more competitors and more severe pricing pressure. In addition, our competitors may be narrowing or eliminating our performance advantages. We expect these trends to continue, and our future competitiveness will depend on our ability to develop new products and reduce our product costs. While we believe that our products have important competitive advantages, our competitors may succeed in developing and marketing products that perform better or are less expensive than ours, or that would render our products and technology obsolete or noncompetitive. Our business may suffer because we have limited influence over the rate of adoption of our technology, and MRAM technology may not build into a large or significant market. A significant portion of our future revenue and profits may be dependent on our licensees introducing MRAM products. Production difficulties, technical barriers, high production costs, poor market reception, or other problems, almost all of which are outside our control, could prevent the deployment of MRAM or limit its market potential. Furthermore, competing technologies could prevent or supplant MRAM from becoming an important memory technology. Our future business may suffer because we may not be able to consummate additional MRAM license agreements. Although there are potential licensees for our MRAM intellectual property in addition to our current licensees, we may never be able to consummate additional license agreements. Potential licensees could also use their own or a third partys MRAM intellectual property rather than ours. We may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights or our technology may prove to infringe upon patents or rights owned by others, which may prevent the future sale of our products or increase the cost of such sales. We protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property by seeking patents, trademarks, and copyrights, and by maintaining trade secrets through entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, suppliers, customers, and prospective customers depending on the circumstances. We hold patents or are the licensee of others owning patented technology covering certain aspects of our products and technology. These patent rights may be challenged, rendered unenforceable, invalidated, or circumvented. In addition, rights granted under the patents or under licensing agreements may not provide a competitive advantage to us. At least several potential MRAM competitors have described designs that we believe would infringe on our patents if such designs were to be commercialized. Efforts to legally enforce patent rights can involve substantial expense and may not be successful. Further, others may independently develop similar, superior, or parallel technologies to any technology developed by us, or our technology may prove to infringe upon patents or rights owned by others. Thus the patents held by or licensed to us may not afford us any meaningful competitive advantage. Also, our confidentiality agreements may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary information. Our inability to maintain our proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may not be able to negotiate a new MRAM licensing agreement with Freescale or EverSpin. Our Patent License Option Agreement with Motorola provided for termination on December 31, 2005 or on the date Motorola ceases manufacturing MRAM Products, whichever is later. We believe such a termination is likely to have occurred as a result of Motorola apparently having eliminated its ability to manufacture MRAM Products through its spinoff of Freescale. In June 2008 Freescale announced that it had transferred its MRAM technology and intellectual property to an independent company, EverSpin Technologies. We believe we are free to negotiate a new agreement with Freescale or EverSpin, or an assignment of the Motorola Patent License Option Agreement, but we have said we would do so only with amendments thereto. We have notified Freescale that we believe that MRAM products it has sold come within the scope of claims of a number of our patents. There can be no assurance, however, that any agreement can be reached with Freescale or EverSpin, or that any such agreement would be on more favorable terms to NVE than our agreement with Motorola, or that NVE would receive any value under the existing agreement with Motorola or any value under any such further agreement with Freescale or EverSpin. Our future business may suffer if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights with existing licensees. Our existing license agreements have not generated royalties and may never become active or generate significant royalties. Furthermore, our success in enforcing our intellectual property rights may be dependent on our ability to enforce our contract rights under existing license agreements. Our existing licensees could claim without merit that they do not use our intellectual property or claim that one or more of our patents are invalid. In 2000 we were forced to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights with Motorola, and we plan to continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights. Our limited capital resources could put us at a disadvantage if we take legal action to enforce our intellectual property rights. 11 Table of Contents Our business success may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and technical employees. We have no employment agreements with any of our management other than our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and have no key-person insurance covering employees. Competition for highly qualified management and technical personnel is generally intense and we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development and operation of our business. The loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our marketable securities are subject to risks which may affect the liquidity of these investments or cause losses. At March 31, 2009, we held $32,446,748 in long-term marketable securities, which included government agency obligations, municipal obligations, and corporate obligations. The ongoing credit crisis has significantly affected issuer credit rating, insurer financial condition and credit rating, liquidity, market, and interest rates for these and other types of obligations. The financial market risks associated with our marketable securities may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Risks Related to Buying Our Stock Our stock has been more volatile than other technology sector stocks. The market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Depending on the metric used, we believe this volatility is more than the overall market or some other technology-sector stocks. The price of our common stock may be adversely affected by significant price fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. From time to time our stock price has decreased sharply, and could decline in the future. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:  technological innovations by us, our licensees, or our competitors;  the announcement of new products, product enhancements, contracts, or license agreements by us, our licensees, or our competitors;  the announcement of changes in strategy or discontinuation of products by us or licensees;  changes in requirements or demands for our products or technology;  changes in prices of our products and services or our competitors products and services;  quarterly variations in our operating results;  changes in our revenue or revenue growth rates;  changes in revenue estimates, earnings estimates, or market projections by market analysts, speculation in the press or analyst community;  short selling and covering of short positions in our stock; and  general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries served by us, our customers, or our licensees.
