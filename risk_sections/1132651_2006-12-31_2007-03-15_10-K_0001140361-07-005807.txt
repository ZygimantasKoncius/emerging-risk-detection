BUSINESS General Ames National Corporation (the "Company") is an Iowa corporation and bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company owns 100% of the stock of five banking subsidiaries consisting of two national banks and three state-chartered banks, as described below. All of the Company’s operations are conducted in the State of Iowa and primarily within the central Iowa counties of Boone, Story and Marshall where the Company’s banking subsidiaries are located. The Company does not engage in any material business activities apart from its ownership of its banking subsidiaries. The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 405 Fifth Street, Ames, Iowa 50010 and its telephone number is (515) 232-6251. The Company was organized and incorporated on January 21, 1975 under the laws of the State of Iowa to serve as a holding company for its principal banking subsidiary, First National Bank, Ames, Iowa ("First National") located in Ames, Iowa. In 1983, the Company acquired the stock of the State Bank & Trust Co. ("State Bank") located in Nevada, Iowa; in 1991, the Company, through a newly-chartered state bank known as Boone Bank & Trust Co. ("Boone Bank"), acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the former Boone State Bank & Trust Company located in Boone, Iowa; in 1995, the Company acquired the stock of the Randall-Story State Bank (”Randall-Story Bank”) located in Story City, Iowa; and in 2002, the Company chartered and commenced operations of a new national banking organization, United Bank & Trust NA (“United Bank”), located in Marshalltown, Iowa. First National, State Bank, Boone Bank, Randall-Story Bank and United Bank are each operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. These five financial institutions are referred to in this Form 10-K collectively as the “Banks” and individually as a “Bank”. The principal sources of Company revenue are: (i) interest and fees earned on loans made by the Banks; (ii) service charges on deposit accounts maintained at the Banks; (iii) interest on fixed income investments held by the Banks; (iv) fees on trust services provided by those Banks exercising trust powers; and (v) securities gains and dividends on equity investments held by the Company and the Banks. The Banks’ lending activities consist primarily of short-term and medium-term commercial and residential real estate loans, agricultural and business operating loans and lines of credit, equipment loans, vehicle loans, personal loans and lines of credit, home improvement loans and secondary mortgage loan origination. The Banks also offer a variety of demand, savings and time deposits, cash management services, merchant credit card processing, safe deposit boxes, wire transfers, direct deposit of payroll and social security checks and automated teller machine access. Four of the five Banks also offer trust services. The Company provides various services to the Banks which include, but are not limited to, management assistance, internal auditing services, human resources services and administration, compliance management, marketing assistance and coordination, loan review and assistance with respect to computer systems and procedures. 3 Table of Contents Banking Subsidiaries First National Bank, Ames, Iowa. First National is a nationally-chartered, commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”). It was organized in 1903 and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in 1975 through a bank holding company reorganization whereby the then shareholders of First National exchanged all of their First National stock for stock in the Company. First National provides full-service banking to businesses and residents within the Ames community and surrounding area. It provides a variety of products and services designed to meet the needs of the market it serves. It has an experienced staff of bank officers including many who have spent the majority of their banking careers with First National and who emphasize long-term customer relationships.

As of December 31, 2006, First National had capital of $41,284,000 and 88 full-time equivalent employees. Full-time equivalents represent the number of people a business would employ if all its employees were employed on a full-time basis. It is calculated by dividing the total number of hours worked by all full and part-time employees by the number of hours a full-time individual would work for a given period of time. First National had net income of $5,938,000 in 2006, $6,417,000 in 2005, and $6,949,000 in 2004.

Business Strategy and Operations As a locally owned, multi-bank holding company, the Company emphasizes strong personal relationships to provide products and services that meet the needs of the Banks’ customers. The Company seeks to achieve growth and maintain a strong return on equity. To accomplish these goals, the Banks focus on small to medium size businesses that traditionally wish to develop an exclusive relationship with a single bank. The Banks, individually and collectively, have the size to give the personal attention required by business owners, in addition to the credit expertise to help businesses meet their goals. The Banks offer a full range of deposit services that are typically available in most financial institutions, including checking accounts, savings accounts and time deposits of various types, ranging from money market accounts to longer-term certificates of deposit. One major goal in developing the Banks' product mix is to keep the product offerings as simple as possible, both in terms of the number of products and the features and benefits of the individual services. The transaction accounts and time certificates are tailored to each Bank's principal market area at rates competitive in that Bank’s market. In addition, retirement accounts such as IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts) are available. The FDIC insures all deposit accounts up to the maximum amount. The Banks solicit these accounts from small-to-medium sized businesses in their respective primary trade areas, and from individuals who live and/or work within these areas. No material portion of the Banks' deposits has been obtained from a single person or from a few persons. Therefore, the Company does not believe that the loss of the deposits of any person or of a few persons would have an adverse effect on the Banks' operations or erode their deposit base. 5 Table of Contents Loans are provided to creditworthy borrowers regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, marital status, disability, receipt of public assistance or any other basis prohibited by law. The Banks intend to fulfill this commitment while maintaining prudent credit standards. In the course of fulfilling this obligation to meet the credit needs of the communities which they serve, the Banks give consideration to each credit application regardless of the fact that the applicant may reside in a low to moderate income neighborhood, and without regard to the geographic location of the residence, property or business within their market areas. The Banks provide innovative, quality financial products, such as Internet banking and trust services that meet the banking needs of their customers and communities. The loan programs and acceptance of certain loans may vary from time-to-time depending on the funds available and regulations governing the banking industry. The Banks offer all basic types of credit to their local communities and surrounding rural areas, including commercial, agricultural and consumer loans. The types of loans within these categories are as follows: Commercial Loans. Commercial loans are typically made to sole proprietors, partnerships, corporations and other business entities such as municipalities and individuals where the loan is to be used primarily for business purposes. These loans are typically secured by assets owned by the borrower and often times involve personal guarantees given by the owners of the business. The types of loans the Banks offer include: - financing guaranteed under Small Business Administration programs - operating and working capital loans - loans to finance equipment and other capital purchases - commercial real estate loans - business lines of credit - term loans - loans to professionals - letters of credit Agricultural Loans. The Banks, by nature of their location in central Iowa, are directly and indirectly involved in agriculture and agri-business lending. This includes short-term seasonal lending associated with cyclical crop and livestock production, intermediate term lending for machinery, equipment and breeding stock acquisition and long-term real estate lending. These loans are typically secured by the crops, livestock, equipment or real estate being financed. The basic tenet of the Banks' agricultural lending philosophy is a blending of strong, positive cash flow supported by an adequate collateral position, along with a demonstrated capacity to withstand short-term negative impact if necessary. Applicable governmental subsidies and affiliated programs are utilized if warranted to accomplish these parameters. Approximately 14% of the Banks' loans have been made for agricultural purposes. The Banks have not experienced a material adverse effect on their business as a result of defaults on agricultural loans and do not anticipate at the present time experiencing any such effect in the future. 6 Table of Contents Consumer Loans. Consumer loans are typically available to finance home improvements and consumer purchases, such as automobiles, household furnishings, boats and education. These loans are made on both a secured and an unsecured basis. The following types of consumer loans are available: - automobiles and trucks - boats and recreational vehicles - personal loans and lines of credit - home equity lines of credit - home improvement and rehabilitation loans - consumer real estate loans Other types of credit programs, such as loans to nonprofit organizations, to public entities, for community development and to other governmental offered programs also are available. First National, Boone Bank, State Bank and United Bank offer trust services typically found in a commercial bank with trust powers, including the administration of estates, conservatorships, personal and corporate trusts and agency accounts. The Banks also provide farm management, investment and custodial services for individuals, businesses and non-profit organizations. The Banks earn income from the origination of residential mortgages that are sold in the secondary real estate market without retaining the mortgage servicing rights. The Banks offer traditional banking services, such as safe deposit boxes, wire transfers, direct deposit of payroll and social security checks, automated teller machine access and automatic drafts (ACH) for various accounts. Credit Management The Company strives to achieve sound credit risk management. In order to achieve this goal, the Company has established uniform credit policies and underwriting criteria for the Banks’ loan portfolios. The Banks diversify in the types of loans offered and are subject to regular credit examinations, annual internal and external loan audits and annual review of large loans, as well as quarterly reviews of loans experiencing deterioration in credit quality. The Company attempts to identify potential problem loans early, charge off loans promptly and maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The Company has established credit guidelines for the Banks’ lending portfolios which include guidelines relating to the more commonly requested loan types, as follows: Commercial Real Estate Loans - Commercial real estate loans, including agricultural real estate loans, are normally based on loan to appraisal value ratios of 80% and secured by a first priority lien position. Loans are typically subject to interest rate adjustments no less frequently than 5 years from origination. Fully amortized monthly repayment terms normally do not exceed twenty years. Projections and cash flows that show ability to service debt within the amortization period are required. Property and casualty insurance is required to protect the Banks’ collateral interests. Commercial and agricultural real estate loans represent approximately 45% of the loan portfolio. Major risk factors for commercial real estate loans, as well as the other loan types described below, include a geographic concentration in central Iowa; the dependence of the local economy upon several large governmental entities, including Iowa State University and the Iowa Department of Transportation; and the health of Iowa’s agricultural sector that is dependent on weather conditions and government programs. 7 Table of Contents Commercial and Agricultural Operating Lines - These loans are made to businesses and farm operations with terms up to twelve months. The credit needs are generally seasonal with the source of repayment coming from the entity’s normal business cycle. Cash flow reviews are completed to establish the ability to service the debt within the terms of the loan. A first priority lien on the general assets of the business normally secures these types of loans. Loan to value limits vary and are dependent upon the nature and type of the underlying collateral and the financial strength of the borrower. Crop and hail insurance is required for most agricultural borrowers. Loans are generally guaranteed by the principal(s). Commercial and Agricultural Term Loans – These loans are made to businesses and farm operations to finance equipment, breeding stock and other capital expenditures. Terms are generally the lesser of five years or the useful life of the asset. Term loans are normally secured by the asset being financed and are often additionally secured with the general assets of the business. Loan to value is generally 75% of the cost or value of the assets. Loans are normally guaranteed by the principal(s). Commercial and agricultural operating and term loans represent approximately 20% of the loan portfolio. Residential First Mortgage Loans – Proceeds of these loans are used to buy or refinance the purchase of residential real estate with the loan secured by a first lien on the real estate. Most of the residential mortgage loans originated by the Banks (including servicing rights) are sold in the secondary mortgage market due to the higher interest rate risk inherent in the 15 and 30 year fixed rate terms consumers prefer. Loans that are originated and not sold in the secondary market generally have higher interest rates and have rate adjustment periods of no longer than seven years. The maximum amortization of first mortgage residential real estate loans is 30 years. The loan-to-value ratios normally do not exceed 80% without credit enhancements such as mortgage insurance. Property insurance is required on all loans to protect the Banks’ collateral position. Loans secured by one to four family residential properties represent approximately 23% of the loan portfolio. Home Equity Term Loans – These loans are normally for the purpose of home improvement or other consumer purposes and are secured by a junior mortgage on residential real estate. Loan-to-value ratios normally do not exceed 90% of market value. Home Equity Lines of Credit - The Banks offer a home equity line of credit with a maximum term of 60 months. These loans are secured by a junior mortgage on the residential real estate and normally do not exceed a loan-to-market value ratio of 90% with the interest adjusted quarterly. Consumer Loans – Consumer loans are normally made to consumers under the following guidelines. Automobiles - loans on new and used automobiles generally will not exceed 80% and 75% of the value, respectively. Recreational vehicles and boats - 66% of the value. Mobile home - maximum term on these loans is 180 months with the loan-to-value ratio generally not exceeding 66%. Each of these loans is secured by a first priority lien on the assets and requires insurance to protect the Banks’ collateral position. Unsecured - The term for unsecured loans generally does not exceed 12 months. Consumer and other loans represent approximately 7% of the loan portfolio. 8 Table of Contents Employees At December 31, 2006, the Banks had a total of 172 full-time equivalent employees and the Company had an additional 12 full-time employees. The Company and Banks provide their employees with a comprehensive program of benefits, including comprehensive medical and dental plans, long-term and short-term disability coverage, and a 401(k) profit sharing plan. Management considers its relations with employees to be satisfactory. Unions represent none of the employees. Market Area The Company operates five commercial banks with locations in Story, Boone and Marshall Counties in central Iowa. First National is located in Ames, Iowa with a population of 50,731. The major employers are Iowa State University, Ames Laboratories, Iowa Department of Transportation, Mary Greeley Medical Center, National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames Community Schools, City of Ames, Barilla, Sauer-Danfoss and McFarland Clinic. First National’s primary business includes providing retail banking services and business and consumer lending. First National has a minimum exposure to agricultural lending. Boone Bank is located in Boone, Iowa with a population of 12,800. Boone is the county seat of Boone County. The major employers are Fareway Stores, Inc., Patterson Dental Supply Co., Union Pacific Railroad, and Communication Data Services. Boone Bank provides lending services to the agriculture, commercial and real estate markets. State Bank is located in Nevada, Iowa with a population of 6,658. Nevada is the county seat of Story County. The major employers are Print Graphics, General Financial Supply, Central Iowa Printing, Burke Corporation and Almaco. State Bank provides various types of loans with a major agricultural presence. It provides a wide variety of banking services including trust, deposit, ATM, and merchant card processing. Randall-Story Bank is located in Story City, Iowa with a population of 3,228. The major employers are Pella Corporation, Bethany Manor, American Packaging, Precision Machine and Record Printing. Located in a major agricultural area, it has a strong presence in this type of lending. As a full service commercial bank it provides a full line of products and services. United Bank is located in Marshalltown, Iowa with a population of 26,123. The major employers are Swift & Co., Fisher Controls International, Lennox Industries and Marshalltown Medical & Surgical Center. The Bank offers a full line of loan, deposit, and trust services. Loan services include primarily commercial and consumer types of credit including operating lines, equipment loans, automobile financing and real estate loans. 9 Table of Contents Competition The geographic market area served by the Banks is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits. The Banks compete principally with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance divisions of auto and farm equipment companies, agricultural suppliers and other financial service providers. Some of these competitors are local, while others are statewide or nationwide. The major commercial bank competitors include F & M Bank, U.S. Bank National Association and Wells Fargo Bank, each of which have a branch office or offices within the Banks’ primary trade areas. Among the advantages such larger banks have are their ability to finance extensive advertising campaigns and to allocate their investment assets to geographic regions of higher yield and demand. These larger banking organizations have much higher legal lending limits than the Banks and thus are better able to finance large regional, national and global commercial customers. In order to compete with the other financial institutions in their primary trade areas, the Banks use, to the fullest extent possible, the flexibility which is accorded by independent status. This includes an emphasis on specialized services, local promotional activity and personal contacts by the Banks' officers, directors and employees. In particular, the Banks compete for deposits principally by offering depositors a wide variety of deposit programs, convenient office locations, hours and other services. The Banks compete for loans primarily by offering competitive interest rates, experienced lending personnel and quality products and services. As of December 31, 2006, there were 26 FDIC insured institutions having approximately 65 offices or branch offices within Boone, Story and Marshall County, Iowa where the Banks' offices are located. First National, State Bank and Randall-Story Bank together have the largest percentage of deposits in Story County and Boone Bank has the highest percentage of deposits in Boone County. The Banks also compete with the financial markets for funds. Yields on corporate and government debt securities and commercial paper affect the ability of commercial banks to attract and hold deposits. Commercial banks also compete for funds with equity, money market, and insurance products offered by brokerage and insurance companies. This competitive trend will likely continue in the future. The Company anticipates bank competition will continue to change materially over the next several years as more financial institutions, including the major regional and national banks, continue to consolidate. Credit unions, which are not subject to income taxes, have a significant competitive advantage and provide additional competition in the Company’s local markets. Supervision and Regulation The following discussion generally refers to certain statutes and regulations affecting the banking industry. These references provide brief summaries and therefore do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to those statutes and regulations. In addition, due to the numerous statutes and regulations that apply to and regulate the banking industry, many are not referenced below. 10 Table of Contents USA Patriot Act. The USA Patriot Act was enacted in 2001 which, together with regulations issued pursuant to this act, substantially broadened previously existing anti-money laundering law and regulation, increased compliance, due diligence and reporting obligations for financial institutions, created new crimes and penalties and required federal banking agencies, in reviewing merger and other acquisition transactions, to consider the effectiveness of the parties in combating money laundering activities. The Act requires all financial institutions to establish certain anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence programs that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering. The Company believes its compliance policies, procedures and controls satisfy the material requirements of the Patriot Act and regulations. Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted in 2002 to, among other things, increase corporate responsibility and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the federal securities laws. This act generally applies to all companies that are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Act implements significant changes in the responsibilities of officers and directors of public companies and makes certain changes to the corporate reporting obligation of those companies and their external auditors. Among the requirements and prohibitions addressed by the act are certifications required by CEOs and CFOs of periodic reports filed with the SEC; accelerated reporting of stock transactions by directors, officers and large shareholders; prohibitions against personal loans from companies to directors and executive officers (except loans made in the ordinary course of business); requirements for public companies’ audit committees; requirements for auditor independence; the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer’s securities by directors and executive officers in the 12-month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement; various increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws; and the creation of a public company accounting oversight board. Rules adopted by the SEC to implement various provisions of the act include CEO and CFO certifications related to fair presentation of financial statements and financial information in public filings, as well as management’s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures; disclosure of whether any audit committee members qualify as a “financial expert”; disclosures related to audit committee composition and auditor pre-approval policies; disclosure related to adoption of a written code of ethics; reconciling non-GAAP financial information with GAAP in public communications; disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions; and disclosure related to director independence and the director nomination process. The Company has adopted modifications to its corporate governance procedures to comply with the provisions of the act and regulations. The Company and the Banks are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Regulation and supervision of financial institutions is primarily intended to protect depositors and the FDIC rather than shareholders of the Company. The laws and regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies have changed significantly over recent years, particularly with the passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act. There is reason to expect that similar changes will continue in the future. Any change in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory policies may have a material effect on the business, operations and prospects of the Company. The Company is unable to predict the nature or the extent of the effects on its business and earnings that any fiscal or monetary policies or new federal or state legislation may have in the future. 11 Table of Contents The Company The Company is a bank holding company by virtue of its ownership of the Banks, and is registered as such with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve"). The Company is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"), which subjects the Company and the Banks to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. Under the BHCA, the Company files with the Federal Reserve annual reports of its operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. Source of Strength to the Banks. The Federal Reserve takes the position that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the Federal Reserve's position that in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, bank holding companies should use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity. It should also maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for providing assistance to its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company's failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve's regulations or both. Federal Reserve Approval. Bank holding companies must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they: (i) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting stock of any bank if, after such acquisition, they would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting stock of such bank; (ii) merge or consolidate with another bank holding company; or (iii) acquire substantially all of the assets of any additional banks. Non-Banking Activities. With certain exceptions, the BHCA also prohibits bank holding companies from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of voting stock in any company other than a bank or a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve finds the company's business to be incidental to the business of banking. When making this determination, the Federal Reserve in part considers whether allowing a bank holding company to engage in those activities would offer advantages to the public that would outweigh possible adverse effects. A bank holding company may engage in permissible non-banking activities on a de novo basis, if the holding company meets certain criteria and notifies the Federal Reserve within ten (10) business days after the activity has commenced. Under the Financial Services Modernization Act, eligible bank holding companies may elect (with the approval of the Federal Reserve) to become a "financial holding company." Financial holding companies are permitted to engage in certain financial activities through affiliates that had previously been prohibited activities for bank holding companies. Such financial activities include securities and insurance underwriting and merchant banking. At this time, the Company has not elected to become a financial holding company, but may choose to do so at some time in the future. Control Transactions. The Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, requires a person or group of persons acquiring "control" of a bank holding company to provide the Federal Reserve with at least 60 days prior written notice of the proposed acquisition. Following receipt of this notice, the Federal Reserve has 60 days to issue a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, but the Federal Reserve may extend this time period for up to another 30 days. An acquisition may be completed before the disapproval period expires if the Federal Reserve issues written notice of its intent not to disapprove the action. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, would constitute the acquisition of control. In addition, any "company" would be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA before acquiring 25% (or 5% if the "company" is a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding shares of the Company, or otherwise obtain control over the Company. 12 Table of Contents Affiliate Transactions. The Company and the Banks are deemed affiliates within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between affiliates are subject to certain restrictions. Generally, the Federal Reserve Act: (i) limits the extent to which the financial institution or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with an affiliate; and (ii) requires all transactions with an affiliate, whether or not "covered transactions," to be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution or subsidiary, as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term "covered transaction" includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar transactions. State Law on Acquisitions. Iowa law permits bank holding companies to make acquisitions throughout the state. However, Iowa currently has a deposit concentration limit of 15% on the amount of deposits in the state that any one banking organization can control and continue to acquire banks or bank deposits (by acquisitions), which applies to all depository institutions doing business in Iowa. Banking Subsidiaries Applicable federal and state statutes and regulations governing a bank's operations relate, among other matters, to capital adequacy requirements, required reserves against deposits, investments, loans, legal lending limits, certain interest rates payable, mergers and consolidations, borrowings, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches and dealings with affiliated persons. First National and United Bank are national banks subject to primary federal regulation and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"). The FDIC, as an insurer of the deposits, also has some limited regulatory authority over First National and United Bank. State Bank, Boone Bank and Randall-Story Bank are state banks subject to regulation and supervision by the Iowa Division of Banking. The three state Banks are also subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures their respective deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law. The federal laws that apply to the Banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for loans. The laws and regulations governing the Banks generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the deposit insurance fund of the FDIC and not to protect stockholders of such institutions or their holding companies. The OCC and FDIC each has authority to prohibit banks under their supervision from engaging in what it considers to be an unsafe and unsound practice in conducting their business. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") requires federal banking regulators to adopt regulations or guidelines in a number of areas to ensure bank safety and soundness, including internal controls, credit underwriting, asset growth, management compensation, ratios of classified assets to capital and earnings. FDICIA also contains provisions which are intended to change independent auditing requirements, restrict the activities of state-chartered insured banks, amend various consumer banking laws, limit the ability of "undercapitalized banks" to borrow from the Federal Reserve's discount window, require regulators to perform periodic on-site bank examinations and set standards for real estate lending. 13 Table of Contents Borrowing Limitations. Each of the Banks is subject to limitations on the aggregate amount of loans that it can make to any one borrower, including related entities. Subject to numerous exceptions based on the type of loans and collateral, applicable statutes and regulations generally limit loans to one borrower of 15% of total equity and reserves. Each of the Banks is in compliance with applicable loans to one borrower requirements. FDIC Insurance. Generally, customer deposit accounts in banks are insured by the FDIC for up to a maximum amount of $100,000 for single accounts, $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts, $100,000 for joint accounts, and $100,000 for qualifying revocable trust accounts. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based insurance assessment system under which depository institutions contribute funds to the FDIC insurance fund based on their risk classification. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines after an administrative hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law. Capital Adequacy Requirements. The Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC (collectively, the "Agencies") have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies that are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies and account for off-balance sheet items. Failure to achieve and maintain adequate capital levels may give rise to supervisory action through the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels. Each of the Banks is in compliance with applicable capital level requirements. The current guidelines require all federally regulated banks to maintain a minimum risk-based total capital ratio equal to 8%, of which at least 4% must be Tier 1 capital. Tier 1 capital includes common shareholders' equity, qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, but excludes goodwill and most other intangibles and the allowance for loan and lease losses. Tier 2 capital includes the excess of any preferred stock not included in Tier 1 capital, mandatory convertible securities, hybrid capital instruments, subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock, 45% of unrealized gain of equity securities and general reserve for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of risk weighted assets. None of the Banks has received any notice indicating that it will be subject to higher capital requirements. Under these guidelines, banks' assets are given risk weights of 0%, 20%, 50% or 100%. Most loans are assigned to the 100% risk category, except for first mortgage loans fully secured by residential property and, under certain circumstances, residential construction loans (both carry a 50% rating). Most investment securities are assigned to the 20% category, except for municipal or state revenue bonds (which have a 50% rating) and direct obligations of or obligations guaranteed by the United States Treasury or United States Government Agencies (which have a 0% rating). 14 Table of Contents The Agencies have also implemented a leverage ratio, which is equal to Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average total assets less intangibles, to be used as a supplement to the risk based guidelines. The principal objective of the leverage ratio is to limit the maximum degree to which a bank may leverage its equity capital base. The minimum required leverage ratio for top rated institutions is 3%, but most institutions are required to maintain an additional cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points. Any institution operating at or near the 3% level is expected to be a strong banking organization without any supervisory, financial or operational weaknesses or deficiencies. Any institutions experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions, well above the minimum levels. Prompt Corrective Action. Regulations adopted by the Agencies impose even more stringent capital requirements. The FDIC and other Agencies must take certain "prompt corrective action" when a bank fails to meet capital requirements. The regulations establish and define five capital levels: (i) "well-capitalized," (ii) "adequately capitalized," (iii) "undercapitalized," (iv) "significantly undercapitalized" and (v) "critically undercapitalized." Increasingly severe restrictions are imposed on the payment of dividends and management fees, asset growth and other aspects of the operations of institutions that fall below the category of being "adequately capitalized". Undercapitalized institutions are required to develop and implement capital plans acceptable to the appropriate federal regulatory agency. Such plans must require that any company that controls the undercapitalized institution must provide certain guarantees that the institution will comply with the plan until it is adequately capitalized. As of February 28, 2007, neither the Company nor any of the Banks were subject to any regulatory order, agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Furthermore, as of that same date, each of the Banks was categorized as “well capitalized” under regulatory prompt corrective action provisions. Restrictions on Dividends. Dividends paid to the Company by the Banks is the major source of Company cash flow. Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends banking subsidiaries are permitted to pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. Federal Reserve policy further limits the circumstances under which bank holding companies may declare dividends. For example, a bank holding company should not continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Federal and state banking regulators may also restrict the payment of dividends by order. First National Bank, as a national bank, generally may pay dividends, without obtaining the express approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in amount up to its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years plus retained net profits up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year. Retained net profits as defined by the OCC, consists of net income less dividends declared during the period. Boone Bank, Randall-Story Bank and State Bank are also restricted under Iowa law to paying dividends only out of their undivided profits. Additionally, the payment of dividends by the Banks is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and the Banks generally are prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the Bank would be undercapitalized. 15 Table of Contents Reserves Against Deposits. The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily checking accounts) and non-personal time deposits. Generally, reserves of 3% must be maintained against total transaction accounts of $45,800,000 or less (subject to an exemption not in excess of the first $8,500,000 of transaction accounts). A reserve of $1,374,000 plus 10% of amounts in excess of $45,800,000 must be maintained in the event total transaction accounts exceed $45,800,000. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve may be used to satisfy applicable liquidity requirements. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or a noninterest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the earning assets of the Banks. Regulatory Developments In 2000, the Financial Services Modernization Act was enacted which: (i) repealed historical restrictions on preventing banks from affiliating with securities firms; (ii) broadens the activities that may be conducted by national banks and banking subsidiaries of holding companies; and (iii) provides an enhanced framework for protecting the privacy of consumers' information. In addition, bank holding companies may be owned, controlled or acquired by any company engaged in financially related activities, as long as such company meets regulatory requirements. To the extent that this legislation permits banks to affiliate with financial services companies, the banking industry may experience further consolidation. Regulatory Enforcement Authority The enforcement powers available to federal and state banking regulators are substantial and include, among other things, the ability to assess civil monetary penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. In general, enforcement actions must be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions, or inactions, may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. Applicable law also requires public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the federal banking agencies. National Monetary Policies In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, the earnings and growth of the Banks are affected by the regulatory authorities’ policies, including the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply, credit conditions and interest rates. Among the instruments used to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits and the Federal Reserve Discount Rate, which is the rate charged member banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. 16 Table of Contents The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had a material impact on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to have a similar impact in the future. Also important in terms of effect on banks are controls on interest rates paid by banks on deposits and types of deposits that may be offered by banks. The Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee, created by Congress in 1980, phased out ceilings on the rate of interest that may be paid on deposits by commercial banks and savings and loan associations, with the result that the differentials between the maximum rates banks and savings and loans can pay on deposit accounts have been eliminated. The effect of deregulation of deposit interest rates has been to increase banks' cost of funds and to make banks more sensitive to fluctuation in market rates.

RISK FACTORS Rising Interest Rates The Company has experienced a decrease in net income from 2004 to 2006, primarily as a result of reductions in net interest income due to rising market interest rates that have caused interest expense to increase more quickly than interest income. Rising interest rates will again present a challenge to the Company in 2007. Continued increases in interest rates may negatively impact the Company’s net interest margin if interest expense increases more quickly than interest income. The Company’s earning assets (primarily its loan and investment portfolio) have longer maturities than its interest bearing liabilities (primarily its deposits and other borrowings). Therefore, in a rising interest rate environment, interest expense will increase more quickly than interest income, as the interest bearing liabilities reprice more quickly than earning assets. In response to this challenge, the Banks model quarterly the changes in income that would result from various changes in interest rates. Management believes Bank earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and the Banks’ interest rate risk positions. 18 Table of Contents Concentration of Operations The Company’s operations are concentrated in central Iowa. As a result of this geographic concentration, the Company’s results may correlate to the economic conditions in this area. Deterioration in economic conditions, particularly in the industries on which this area depends (including agriculture which, in turn, is dependent upon weather conditions and government support programs), may adversely affect the quality of the Company’s loan portfolio and the demand for the Company’s products and services, and accordingly, its results of operations. Risks Associated with Loans A significant source of risk for the Company arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. The Company has underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies, including the establishment and review of the allowance for loan losses, that management believes are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance, tracking loan performance and diversifying the Company’s loan portfolio. Such policies and procedures, however, may not prevent unexpected losses that could adversely affect results of operations. Competition with Larger Financial Institutions The banking and financial services business in the Company’s market area continues to be a competitive field and is becoming more competitive as a result of: · changes in regulations; · changes in technology and product delivery systems; and · the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. It may be difficult to compete effectively in the Company’s market, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the nature or pace of change in competition. The Company competes for loans, deposits and customers with various bank and non-bank financial services providers, many of which are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader array of financial services. 19 Table of Contents Trading Volume The trading volume in the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market is relatively limited compared to those of larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Nasdaq Global Markets, the New York Stock Exchange or other consolidated reporting systems or stock exchanges. A change in the supply or demand for the Company’s common stock may have a more significant impact on the price of the Company’s stock than for more actively traded companies. Technological Advances The financial services industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving customer services, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. The Company’s future success will depend, in part, on its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company’s operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than the Company to invest in technological improvements. Government Regulations Current and future legislation and the policies established by federal and state regulatory authorities will affect the Company’s operations. The Company and its Banks are subject to extensive supervision of, and examination by, federal and state regulatory authorities which may limit the Company’s growth and the return to our shareholders by restricting certain activities, such as: · the payment of dividends to the Company’s shareholders; · the payment of dividends to the Company from the Banks; · possible mergers with or acquisitions of or by other institutions; · investment policies; · loans and interest rates on loans; · interest rates paid on deposits; · expansion of branch offices; and/or · the possibility to provide or expand securities or trust services. The Company cannot predict what changes, if any, will be made to existing federal and state legislation and regulations or the effect that any changes may have on future business and earnings prospects. The cost of compliance with regulatory requirements may adversely affect the Company’s net income. 20 Table of Contents Equity Prices A substandard performance in the Company’s equity portfolio could lead to a reduction in the historical level of realized security gains, thereby negatively impacting the Company’s earnings. The Company invests capital that may be utilized for future expansion in a portfolio of primarily financial and utility stocks with an estimated fair market value of approximately $24 million as of December 31, 2006. The Company focuses on stocks that have historically paid dividends in an effort to lessen the negative effects of a bear market. ITEM 1B.
