D. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business As a Whole - Impact of inflation may adversely affect our financial expenses and operating income," “-Related to Our Business As a Whole - Currency fluctuations might affect our operating results and translation of operating results," and “Risks Related to Dor Alon - Dor Alon is exposed to fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate, interest rates and the consumer price index, which could materially adversely affect its financial results.” 113 Any devaluation of the NIS against various non-Israeli currencies in which we or our suppliers pay for imported goods has the effect of increasing the selling price of those products which we sell in Israel in NIS and affects our operating results. In particular, a devaluation of the NIS against the Chinese currency could significantly increase the cost of production of our non-food products at our Bee Group stores and the selling price of those products to our customers. An increase in price of imported goods by our suppliers can usually be offset by an increase in the consumer price of such goods. This devaluation would have a greater effect on our non-food retail business because a higher proportion of the goods that we sell in our Bee Group stores is acquired from suppliers overseas. This devaluation would also cause an increase in our expenses as recorded in our NIS denominated financial results even though the expenses denominated in non-Israeli currencies will remain unchanged. Moreover, Dor Alon is exposed to fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar - New Israeli Shekel exchange rate due to credit that Dor Alon obtains from its suppliers (mostly from Oil Refineries Ltd., which is linked to the U.S. Dollar). Changes in interest rates, in the Israeli consumer price index and in the U.S. Dollar - New Israeli Shekel exchange rate could materially adversely affect Dor Alon’s financial results. In addition, Dor Alon has loans in New Israeli Shekels, some of which are subject to floating interest rates and some are linked to the Israeli consumer price index. Due to these loans and to the consumer price index linked debentures issued by Dor Alon, Dor Alon is exposed to changes in bank interest rates and in the Israeli consumer price index. In addition, because our financial results are denominated in NIS and are translated into US dollars for the convenience of US investors, currency fluctuations of the NIS against the US dollar may impact our US dollar translated financial results. Political Conditions We and all of our subsidiaries are incorporated under Israeli law and our principal offices and operations are located in the State of Israel. Political, economic, security and military conditions in Israel directly affect our operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. A state of hostility, varying from time to time, in intensity and degree, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994. Israel has not entered into any peace agreements with Syria and Lebanon. In the last few years, the establishment of a Hamas government in Gaza has created additional unrest and uncertainty in the region and has increased hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians. These hostilities have included terrorist acts in Israel and military operations in the West Bank and Gaza. During the last decade, there has been a high level of violence between Israel and the Palastinians, including missile strikes by Hamas against Israel. In December 2008 Israel was engaged in an armed conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which reduced the sales of some of our stores that are located in the southern region of Israel. In July 2006, a conflict with Hezbollah escalated significantly on Israel’s northern border, as a result of which a number of our stores located in the northern region did not operate according to their usual schedule. In addition, deterioration in the security situation causes a decrease in the consumption of petroleum products in Israel and airlines’ volume of activity and affects the trade relations between Dor Alon and the Palestinian Authority, which could adversely affect Dor Alon’s results of operations. We cannot predict the effect on our business if hostilities are renewed or the security situation deteriorates in any part of the country. 114 The future of Israel’s relations with its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians is uncertain and several countries, companies and organizations continue to restrict business with Israel and with Israeli companies. We believe that in the past, these practices have not had a material adverse effect on us. However, we could be adversely affected by adverse developments in Israel’s relationships with its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians, or by restrictive laws, policies or practices directed towards Israel or Israeli businesses. In addition, ongoing violence between Israel and its Arab neighbors and Palastinians may have a material adverse effect on the Israeli economy, in general, and on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In particular, in recent conflicts, missile attacks have occurred on civilian areas, which could cause substantial damage to our infrastructure network, reducing our ability to continue serving our customers as well as our overall network capacity. In addition, in the event recent political unrest and instability in the Middle East, including changes in some of the governments in the region, causes investor concerns in a reduction in the value of the shekel, our expenses in non-shekel currencies may increase, with a material adverse affect on our financial results. Most of Bee Group's imports during 2010 and 2011 were from suppliers located in China. Because most of the products sold by the Bee Group are manufactured overseas and imported from China, its activity may be affected by changes in the political and economic conditions in China. In addition, because the Bee Group acquires most of its products from suppliers outside of Israel, and most of its products are imported via the sea, a prolonged general strike, shutdown or a disruption of any of the Israeli ports for an extended period of time, including as a result of a military conflict, would affect our ability to import such products or increase their prices. In addition, since the peak selling season of some of our Bee Group stores is during the holidays, disruptions in the ports during or adjacent to such holiday seasons may adversely affect our sales and financial results. Economic Conditions All of our supermarket sales are made in Israel and we acquire a substantial majority of the goods that we sell from Israeli suppliers. Consequently, our financial performance is dependent to a significant extent on the economy of Israel. During 2009 and 2010, Israel's Gross Domestic Product rose by 0.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Reports of the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics indicate that during 2011 Israel's Gross Domestic Product rose by 4.7% as a result of an increase in exports. Initial reports indicate that gross domestic product increased by 3.0% (annualized) during the first quarter of 2012. We believe that, despite the economic growth in 2011 and beginning of 2012, our customers continue to be cautious in their buying patterns and continue to choose to make their purchases at low-price and hard discount stores, which have a lower profit margin. As a result, we have continued to expand our low-price and hard discount store formats. 115 The global economic crisis, instability and uncertainty have also affected our non-food retail business by causing a slowdown in the growth of private consumption, which could affect the growth of our houseware, home textile, toys, leisure and baby and young children accessories businesses. Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, the Israeli economy began to recover, and in 2010 and 2011 continued to recover, and there has been an improvement in the growth of private consumption. We cannot yet predict whether the global economic crisis has passed; in the event the crisis will return, it may have a negative impact on the Company. In addition, the global economic crisis has also reduced the availability of credit, increased the costs of financing and the terms under which banks, in Israel and abroad, agree to provide financing. Such conditions are worsening during the beginning of 2012 in light of the Banks' Inspector Instructions which limit the availability of credit, specially in the real estate sector. These developments may reduce the sales of our businesses, increase our costs of borrowing and reduce our profitability. Trade Agreements Israel is a member of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, and since 2010, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, also known as, OECD. Israel is a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which provides for reciprocal lowering of trade barriers among its members. In addition, Israel has been granted preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences from the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan. These preferences allow Israel to export the products covered by these programs either duty-free or at reduced tariffs. In addition, Israel, the EU (known as the European Union), and the European Free Trade Association have a free trade agreement. In recent years, Israel has established commercial and trade relations with a number of other nations, including China, India, Russia, Turkey and other nations in Eastern Europe and Asia. Corporate Tax Rate We and our subsidiaries are subject to corporate tax in Israel at a flat rate of 25% in 2012 (25% in 2010 and 24% in 2011). Prior to the enactment of the Law for Changing the Tax Burden in Israel (the "Tax Change Law"), the corporate tax rates were scheduled to be reduced to 23% in 2012 and ultimately to 18% by 2016. This scheduled gradual reduction in corporate tax rates was repealed. Instead, on December 5, 2011, the Israeli Knesset approved an amendment to the Law for Changing the Tax Burden in Israel (Legislation Amendments) (the "New Tax Change Law") as a result of the recommendations of the Trachtenburg Committee. Pursuant to the New Tax Change Law, the tax reduction determined in the Law for Economic Efficiency is cancelled, and the corporate tax rate will be increased to 25% as of 2012. Due to the New Tax Change Law, we recognized one-time income tax expenses for 2011 in the amount of NIS 34.4 million based on updating deferred taxes as of the date of the approval the New Tax Change Law. 116 Until 2008, our taxable income was determined under the Income Tax (Inflationary Adjustment) Law 1985 (the “Inflationary Adjustments Law”), which attempts to overcome some of the issues encountered by a traditional tax system with respect to inflation. In February 2008, the Knesset (Israeli Parliament) approved Amendment No. 20 to the Inflationary Adjustments Law. The Amendment repealed the Inflationary Adjustments Law as of January 1, 2008 and set certain transition rules. For further tax information, see “Item 10. Additional Information - E. Taxation -Israeli Tax Considerations.” Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and could have a material impact on our reported results. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Impairment of non financial assets We review at each statement of financial position date whether any events have occurred or changes in circumstances have taken place which might indicate that there has been an impairment of property and equipment and identifiable intangibles. When such indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate whether the carrying value of the asset in our accounts can be recovered from the cash flows anticipated from that asset, and, if necessary, record an impairment provision necessary to adjust the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. When it is not possible to assess whether an impairment provision is required for an individual asset which does not generate independent cash flows, the need for such a provision is assessed in relation to the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit to which that asset belongs. For a cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, any impairment loss relating to that unit initially reduces the goodwill and the balance reduces the carrying amount of the other assets. We evaluate impairment separately for each store or the cash-generating unit to which the store belongs when the cash inflows of one store are dependent on the cash inflows of another store in the same geographic area. In evaluating impairment, we consider corporate assets relating to the stores or other cash-generating units as well as indirect costs that are directly attributable, or that can be reasonably and consistently allocated, to the stores or cash generating units. 117 The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of the net selling price of the asset's fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. These calculations require the use of estimates. In calculating the impairment for the reported years, based on discounted expected future cash flows, we used a discount rate before tax for each cash-generating unit (CGU). For discount rates used by the Company, see note 8b to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2011, we recorded impairment provisions resulting in the net amount of NIS 6.1 million. In 2010, we recorded impairment provisions resulting in the net amount of NIS 0.5 million. In 2009, we recorded impairment provisions resulting in the net amount of NIS 18.5 million. Impairment provisions or the reversal of such provisions are included in the income statement within Other gain or losses. Referring to property and equipment, when the discount rate differs by 0.5% from the management estimate, the carrying value of property and equipment would not change. When growth rate differs by 0.5% from the management estimate, the carrying value of property and equipment will be NIS 1.3 million lower or higher. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long-lived assets for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Goodwill Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. Goodwill is allocated to four identified groups of cash-generating units. The amounts of goodwill allocated to the CGU are as follows: December 31 2010 2011 NIS in thousands Supermarkets 162,420 160,993 Non - Food retail and wholesale: Houseware 111,179 111,179 Leisure 23,506 23,506 Commercial and fueling sites 627,208 653,945 924,313 949,623 118 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management and management estimation covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated in Note 9b to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates. The key assumptions used for value in-use calculations are as follows: expected gross margin, weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget management estimations covering a five-year period, and pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections. The annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgments and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Similar to our policy on impairment of long-lived assets, the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items, such as inflation, business valuations in the market, the economy and market competition. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the key assumption used in our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that an increase in the pre-tax discount rate of 0.5% would result in the estimated recoverable amount of Leisure CGU falling below its carrying amount by NIS 3.9 million. We believe that the Leisure CGU is at risk for goodwill impairment in case that the pre-tax discount rate will increase by 0.5%. The recoverable amount of our other CGUs are substantially higher than the carrying value. Adjustment of investment property to fair value Investment property is presented at fair value. In certain cases, fair value is determined using discounted cash flows that are based on assumptions as to discount rate. Changes in the discount rate will change the calculated fair value and may therefore materially affect the results of our operations. The range of discount rates used is 7.75%-12% per annum (mainly 7.75-8.25%). When the discount rate differs by 0.5% from the management estimate, the fair value of investment property will be NIS 22.7 million lower or NIS 25.7 million higher. When the discount rate differs by 1% from the management estimate, the fair value of investment property will be NIS 43.4 million lower or NIS 51.4 million higher. 119 Retirement benefit obligations and Provision for unutilized sick leave 1)Retirement benefit obligations Labor laws and agreements, and common practice, require us to pay retirement benefits to employees dismissed or retiring in certain other circumstances. We contribute to various pension schemes. The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. We have both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Our obligation to pay retirement benefits is generally treated as a defined benefit plan. However, for employees for whom the retirement benefit obligation is covered by section 14 of the Israel Severance Pay Law, the obligation is treated as a defined contribution plan. Defined Benefit Plan The retirement benefit obligation recognized in the statement of financial position is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement of financial position date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows (after taking into account the expected rate of salary increases and other actuarial assumptions) by reference to Israeli Government bonds that are denominated in NIS and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. We determine the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the retirement obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, we consider the interest rates of Israeli government bonds denominated in NIS that have terms to maturity that are comparable to the terms of the related retirement liability. The present value of the obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost of retirement benefits include the discount rate. Other key assumptions, such as future wage increases and retirement rates, are based in part on current market conditions and on past experience. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of the obligations. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized outside of statement of income in the "Statement of Comprehensive Income" in the period in which they arise. 120 Defined Contribution Plan A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which we pay fixed contributions into a separate entity. Our obligation to the employees for whom the retirement benefit obligation is covered by section 14 of the Israel Severance Pay Law as part of the defined contribution plan is to make regular contributions to a separate and independent entity, and we have no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not have sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. 2)Provision for unutilized sick leave Pursuant to employment agreements, certain employees are entitled to receive payment for a certain number of sick leave days per year which accumulate to future periods. Under these said agreements, the Company has undertaken to pay each employee, upon retirement, certain amounts which depend on the balance of the unutilized days and on the cumulative number of sick leave days the employee has utilized during his employment with the Company. The provision for unutilized sick leave is based on an annual actuarial calculation: in making such a computation, the actuary makes actuarial assumptions (such as the rates of employee turnover, future salary levels). The cost of this benefit is recognized using the same method as is used for defined benefit retirement plans. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized outside of the Statement of Income in the Statement of Comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of the obligations. For key management assumptions used in the annual actuarial calculation for retirement benefit obligations and provision for unutilized sick leave, see note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Provisions for claims The provisions for legal claims are recorded based on the estimates of our management (after consulting with legal counsel) as to the likelihood that cash flows will be required to settle these liabilities and as to the discounted amounts of such cash flows. Our assessments are based on the Company's history in these cases, on the stage of these claims and on the experience of the Company's legal advisers. The outcome of the legal cases in court could be different from our assessments. Income taxes and deferred taxes There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates as to whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made. 121 In addition, we recognize deferred tax assets and tax liabilities based on the difference between the carrying value of such assets and liabilities and their amount for tax purposes. We continually assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on historical taxable income, expected taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences and the application of tax planning strategies. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income or actual results differ from our other assumptions, we might be required to reduce our deferred tax assets or to increase our deferred tax liabilities, which will increase our effective tax rate, and negatively affect our results. Fair value of derivative and other financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. We use our judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each statement of financial position date. We have used discounted cash flow analysis for various derivative financial assets that are not traded in active markets. Changes in assumptions could affect the reported fair value of these financial instruments. For sensitivity analysis for the key assumptions see note 3a to our consolidated financial statements. Provision for doubtful debts The provision for doubtful debts is recognized according to management's judgment whenever there are objective indications that the Company will not be able to recover all amounts owing to it under the original terms of the debt, due to material financial difficulties of the customer, a reasonable expectation that the customer will become insolvent or will undergo a reorganization and will be unable to repay its debts, or a delay in the repayments. Purchasing price allocation in business combination The Company is required to allocate the purchase price of investments in newly consolidated subsidiaries to the assets and liabilities acquired, on the basis of an assessment of their fair values. These valuations require the use of material estimates and judgments by management. These estimates and judgments include assessment of future cash flows, asset lives and growth rates of brand names and customer relationships. In case the acquisition is performed near the statement of financial position date, the preliminary assessment could be subject to change as more information is obtained relating to the assets and liabilities acquired. 122 Recently issued accounting pronouncements For information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see note 2ad to our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash Sources. Our principal source of liquidity is the cash generated by our operations. Both Alon Holdings and its significant subsidiaries have generally generated sufficient cash from their operations to satisfy their respective operating requirements. The available cash resources of Mega Retail, Dor Alon, BSRE, Bee Group and their subsidiaries have historically been used, and are expected to continue to be used, to finance the expansion of these companies. We believe our working capital is sufficient for our present requirements. Cash generated by operations was approximately NIS 627.6 million, or $164.3 million, in 2011, an increase of 205% compared with approximately NIS 205.8 million in 2010. The inclusion of a full year of Dor Alon's results in 2011 was a significant reason for the increase in the cash flow from operating activities in 2011, the amount of NIS 136.3 million. The increase in cash flows from operating activities is mainly due to a decrease in working capital in the Supermarket segment, from advancing receipts from credit card companies of NIS 203.4 million (U.S. $53.2 million), from an increase in advances from purchasers of apartments of NIS 102.6 million (U.S. $26.8 million) net of an increase in tax payments of NIS 85.1 million (U.S. $22.3 million). In 2011, approximately 38% of our supermarket sales were paid for with cash, checks and gift certificates issued by the Company at the point-of-sale, approximately 62% of supermarket sales were paid for with credit cards. During 2011, the average time period that we held inventory was 25 days and the average time period within which our accounts receivable were paid was 30 days. By contrast, as of such date the average time period for payment of our accounts payable was 67 days. Accordingly, increased capital resources are not required to support an increase in our receivables or inventories because we generally sell our products before we pay our suppliers. Other sources of liquidity are long-term and short-term borrowing from banks and others. During 2011, we received from banks long-term loans of NIS 213.6 million, or $55.9 million, and short-term borrowings, net, of NIS 582.5 million, or $152.4 million. For information regarding outstanding balances and repayment information, see "Long-Term Loans from Banks and other Financial Institutions" and " – Debentures." 123 On May 20, 2009, the Israel Securities Authority approved the publication of a shelf prospectus filed by BSRE. The shelf prospectus was valid for a period of two years from publication In July 2010, pursuant to the shelf prospectus, BSRE issued NIS 110 million in principal amount of unsecured non-convertible Series D debentures and received net proceeds of approximately NIS 108.6 million, or $30.6 million (net of issuance expenses of NIS 1.45 million, or $0.41 million). The proceeds from the issuance of the debentures were used for financing BSRE's business activities. In October 2009, pursuant to the shelf prospectus, BSRE issued NIS 300 million in principal amount of unsecured non-convertible Series C debentures and received net proceeds of approximately NIS 294.3 million, or $78 million (net of issuance expenses of NIS 5.7 million, or $1.5 million). The proceeds from the issuance of the debentures were used for financing BSRE's business activities. On May 30, 2011, BSRE published a shelf prospectus, according to which BSRE may issue in the future ordinary shares, debentures by way of expansion of the existing series, debentures, options exercisable into ordinary shares, and options exercisable into debentures. In February 2010, we published a shelf prospectus that allows us to issue marketable securities in Israel during the next two years. In November 2010, pursuant to the shelf prospectus, we issued NIS 100 million in principal amount of unsecured non-convertible Series C debentures and received net proceeds of approximately NIS 96.5 million, or $26.7 million (net of issuance expenses of NIS 3.5 million, or $1.0 million). The proceeds from the issuance of the debentures were used for financing our business activities. Prior issuances In September 2008, BSRE completed the issuance of NIS 125 million in principal amount of unsecured non-convertible (Series B) debentures (in addition to the non-convertible (Series B) debentures issued in August, 2006, described below). BSRE received net proceeds of approximately NIS 121.3 million or $31.9 million in consideration for the debentures. The proceeds from the issuance of the debentures were used, among other things, for investments in real estate and for working capital. The terms of these debentures are identical to the terms of the non-convertible (Series B) debentures issued by BSRE in August 2006. In August 2006, BSRE completed its initial public offering of ordinary shares, unsecured convertible (Series A) and non-convertible (Series B) debentures on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. BSRE received net proceeds of approximately NIS 147.6 million in consideration for its ordinary shares and net proceeds of approximately NIS 731.2 million in consideration for the debentures. The proceeds from the issuance of the debentures were used, among other things, to repay long-term borrowings of NIS 518 million, or $122.6 million, that the Company transferred to BSRE at the time of the transfer of the real estate assets to BSRE while the Company retained the proceeds of the loan. These long-term loans were incurred by the Company as part of its preparations for the transfer of real estate assets and related financial obligations to BSRE prior to its initial public offering. 124 In 2003, we issued NIS 200 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured 5.9% convertible and NIS 200 million in aggregate principal amount of non-convertible debentures. The installments of principal on the convertible debentures are due in 2007, 2009 and 2011, and the installments of principal on the non-convertible debentures are due in 2012, 2013 and 2014. During 2011, we issued a total of 27,399 ordinary shares as a result of the conversion of our convertible debentures in a principal amount of NIS 166,668 million. As of December 31, 2011, the convertible debentures (Series B) were repaid in full and the remaining principal balance (linked to the Israeli CPI) of the non-convertible debentures (Series A) was approximately NIS 229.1 million. Uses. During 2011, we repaid long-term loans in the amount of NIS 382.5 million, or $100.1 million, debentures in the amount of NIS 174.9 million, or $45.8 million, and interest in the amount of NIS 222.7 million, or $58.3 million, and we paid dividends to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries in the amount of NIS 30.7 million or $17.6 million. In recent years, we funded our renovation, remodeling and expansion programs primarily mainly from cash generated by our operations and from long and short-term loans from banks. During 2011, we invested approximately NIS 365.5 million, or $93.3 million, in property and equipment, intangible assets, investment property and payments on account of real estate, a 9.6% increase from our 2010 investment of NIS 325.2 million. Of our investment in property and equipment, intangible assets and investment property in 2011, we invested NIS 193.4 million, or $50.6 million, in land and buildings, including land that we leased and investment property, as compared with NIS 164.1 million in 2010. During 2012, we have spent and currently plan to spend in excess of NIS 203 million, or $53.1 million (based on the representative rate of exchange on March 31, 2012) for the development or acquisition of new supermarkets, the renovation and remodeling of our existing supermarkets and related investments. In addition, during 2012 and 2013, we intend to open approximately 14-18 fueling stations at a cost of approximately NIS 3 million to NIS 4 million per fueling station. We intend to finance our store development, renovation, modeling, expansion and acquisitions mainly from cash generated by our operations and from borrowings from banks and others. Business combinations In November 2008, pursuant to a cash tender offer, we completed the acquisition of the Mega Retail shares that were not previously held by us, for the aggregate consideration of NIS 150.7 million, or $40.2 million (at that time). We currently own 100% of the shares of Mega Retail, and Mega Retail's shares are no longer traded on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange. In September 2008, we acquired an additional 25% of the shares of Bee Group for the aggregate consideration of NIS 35.4 million, or $9.8 million (at that time), increasing our holdings in Bee Group to 85%. Subsequently, in October 2010, we acquired the remaining 15% of the shares of Bee Group for the aggregate consideration of approximately NIS 24.5 million, or $6.8 million (at that time), increasing our holdings in Bee Group to 100%. 125 In October, 2007, we purchased (through Bee Group) 57.87% of the holdings of Naaman Porcelain (51.5% on a fully diluted basis) in consideration for approximately NIS 101 million or approximately $26.26 million (at that time). In March 2009, we purchased (through Bee Group) additional shares of Naaman, in consideration for approximately NIS 7 million, or approximately $1.8 million, following which Bee Group's holdings in Naaman were approximately 66.85% of the outstanding shares. In October, 2007, we purchased 51% of the holding of Eden Briut Teva Market Ltd. ("Eden Nature") in consideration for approximately NIS 22.5 million or approximately $5.85 million (at that time). In addition, under the agreement, (i) we provided Eden Nature with shareholder loans in the amount of NIS 47 million and (ii) we will provide all guarantees and financing required in connection with Eden Nature’s operations in the future, the repayment of existing shareholder loans in the amount of NIS 4.7 million which has since been repaid, and the payment of a bonus to Eden Nature’s CEO upon the satisfaction of various thresholds which have not yet been satisfied. In April 2007, we purchased (through Bee Group) 85.79% of the holdings of Vardinon Textile Ltd. in consideration for approximately NIS 38 million or approximately $9.88 million (at that time). On June 1, 2009 Naaman acquired an additional approximately 3% of the shares of Vardinon. As a result of this acquisition, Naaman increased its holding in Vardinon to approximately 88.74% of the share capital. In February 2011 Na'aman published an offer to purchase the balance of the shares (2.6 million shares) of Vardinon that it does not already own in consideration for NIS 7.9 million. On March 15, 2011, the acquisition was completed, and the Vardinon shares were delisted from the Tel Aviv stock exchange. In November 2011, Bee group issued a full tender offer to purchase 4.8 million shares of Naaman that are not held by the group for NIS 6.53 ($1.8) per share.

Dividends The following table sets forth dividends paid by the Company from January 1, 2007 until the date of this Annual Report: 126 Date of payment Amount per share Total amount(1) December 29, 2011 NIS 1.13 ($0.30) NIS 75 million (approximately $20.2 million) October 18, 2010 NIS 12.31 ($3.39) NIS 800 million (approximately $220.5 million) February 25, 2010 NIS 1.70 ($0.45) NIS 75 million (approximately $19.8 million) October 7, 2008 NIS 3.46 ($0.99) NIS 150 million (approximately $42.82 million) October 8, 2007 NIS 5.07 ($1.27) NIS 220 million (approximately $55 million) April 19, 2007 NIS 1.45 ($0.35) NIS 60 million (approximately $14.7 million) (1)In accordance with the representative rate of exchange of the NIS to the dollar as of the date of the payment of the dividend. In connection with our issuance of NIS 400 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured 5.9% convertible and nonconvertible debentures in August 2003, Alon Holdings' board of directors resolved that Alon Holdings would not distribute dividends in any quarter if the ratio of our net financial obligations (as defined then by S&P-Maalot, an Israeli rating agency owned by S&P) to EBITDA for any quarter exceeds 3.5 until June 30, 2006 or exceeds 3.0 thereafter. Alon Holdings' board of directors also resolved that Alon Holdings would not distribute dividends in any quarter if the ratio of the unencumbered fixed assets (net of depreciation) and investment property as set forth in our financial statements to financial obligations (as defined then by S&P-Maalot) for any quarter is below 120%. On January 14, 2010, Alon Holdings' board of directors decided that in view of the changes and development of Alon Holdings since 2003, including the transfer of Alon Holdings' and Mega Retail's real estate properties to BSRE (which operates under financial obligations to EBITDA ratios appropriate for real estate companies and currently holds a major part of the consolidated debt), the purchase of Bee Group (a Non Food retailer), and the reorganization of Alon Holdings' food retail activities in its subsidiary, Mega Retail Ltd., that the ratio of net financial obligations to EBITDA is to be calculated by deducting from the net financial obligations Alon Holdings' debt which is related by the company to real estate that is not in use by Alon Holdings (which is equal to 75% of the investment property as recorded on the balance sheet). On December 31, 2011, the net financial obligations to EBITDA (calculated in accordance with the deduction described above) were 6 (taking into account Dor Alon’s financial obligations as of December 31, 2011). Due to the acquisition of Dor Alon, in October 2010, increase in the fuel prices which increase our capital needs, the Company's investment plan to open additional Mega Retail branches, the entrance of BSRE to additional new projects and the launching of Alon Cellular, our board of directors further resolved that Alon Holdings would not distribute dividends in any quarter if the ratio of the net financial obligations (calculated in accordance with the deduction described above) to EBITDA for any quarter exceeds 6. 127 Dividends paid by BSRE until the date of this Annual Report: In November 2008, BSRE's board of directors approved a decision to extend the BSRE's policy that existed for the years 2006-2008, according to which BSRE will distribute dividends in the amount of no less than 25% of the net profits of BSRE in each year, to 2008-2010. In March 2011, the Board of Directors approved a decision to adopt a policy for the years 2011 and 2012, according to which BSRE will distribute dividends in the amount of no less than 25% and not higher than 75% of the net profits of BSRE in each year, without taking into account revisions in the net fair value of real estate for investment. Such distributions are subject to the “profit test” under the Israeli Companies Law at the relevant dates and to other decisions of BSRE’s board of directors, including decisions designating a different use of BSRE's profits and/or a change in the BSRE dividend policy.

C.Research and Development, Patents and Licenses. Not applicable. 136 D.Trend Information. Based on data published by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics of the retail sales of food, drinks and tobacco in Israel, we estimate that approximately 33.7% of the total retail sales of food, beverages and tobacco in Israel in 2011 was made by the two large chains and approximately 42% of the estimated retail sales made by supermarkets, groceries and mini-markets in Israel in 2011 was made by the two large chains - a percentage that is considerably lower than the estimated market shares of the major supermarkets prevailing in Europe and the United States. Accordingly, we believe that there is an opportunity for us to grow correspondingly with the general growth of the supermarket sector in Israel. In addition, we believe that we have an opportunity to grow in locations where we do not have a strong presence and in particular in the northern part of the country and in the Jerusalem area. The food retailing industry has been subject to increased competition in recent years. Since the 2005 merger between Shufersal and ClubMarket, another major chain, we have faced a larger competitor, many of whose stores are characterized by the every day sale of products at low prices. We estimate that our market share of the total retail market of food, beverages and tobacco was 13.4% in 2011 compared to 14.1% in 2010. The market share of the other major competitor, Shufersal, based on its financial reports was approximately 20.9% of the total retail market of food, beverages, and tobacco in 2011, compared to 22.7% in 2010 (this calculation is based on the estimate of the Central Bureau of Statistics of the total retail market for food, beverages and tobacco, and our estimate for market growth of 3.7% in 2011). In addition, as a result of consumers’ focus on the price of products, in recent years we and our competitors have established or expanded low-price and hard discount store formats. In 2011, very low-priced smaller supermarket chains continued to aggressively increase their market share and expand their presence in selected areas in Israel, often geographically beyond their original location. The increased competition has led to increased downward pressure on prices. The global economic crisis and the resulting slowdown in the Israeli economy has impacted the food retail market by affecting the buying patterns of our customers, as more customers are shifting their purchases to low-price and hard discount stores, which have a lower profit margin. In response to these trends, in August 2007, we launched our Mega In Town store format to offer discount prices in neighborhood stores. In addition, in December 2008 we launched our Mega Bool heavy discount store format as well as our "Mega" line of private label goods that are sold in our "Mega Bool" and "Mega In Town" stores. We expect to continue to expand our low-price store formats and our sales of products under our "Mega" private label in 2012 in an effort to increase our market share. In addition, during 2009, we launched a new membership card and a new "You" Diners Club and MasterCard credit card as part of our "You" loyalty club, which is designed to increase consumer traffic and encourage customers to patronage our stores. In June 2011, we celebrated the achievement of the millionth You loyalty club customer. During 2012 and 2013, the Company intends to increase the number of the You loyalty club customers. 137 During 2011, there was an increase in the sales through "Mega@Internet" sale site, which was launched in October 2009. In addition, there was an increase in the number of shop in shop formats. In the past few years, we have witnessed a global trend of supermarkets specializing in organic and health products. In response to this trend, we purchased Eden Teva in October 2007, which operates a leading supermarket chain in Israel offering organic/health products. In 2009, we expanded the Eden Teva chain and it now includes eleven stores. During 2010, we began implementing our strategy to establish our Eden Teva format as the leader in Israel's organic/health food market by establishing Eden Teva branches within our existing large store formats under the concept of a "store within a store". In August 2010, we launched our first “Eden in Mega” store as part of our new Eden Teva store format. As of December 31, 2011, Eden Teva operated 17 (including six Eden Stores within Mega) supermarket stores. During 2012, the Company intends to improve the operating results of the Eden Teva stores. In order to compete effectively in the food retailing market we believe we must identify new store locations and opportunities to expand and improve existing store locations. However, sales in new stores or in expanded or improved existing stores may increase at the expense of sales in other existing stores of ours due to geographical proximity. As the supermarket industry grows, the likelihood that sales of one store will adversely affect the sales of a nearby store increases. In 2011, we opened six new stores and closed one store to compete in selective areas in which we did not believe we had sufficient market presence, and we converted 1 Mega store into Mega In Town stores. We also converted 14 "Mega" and "Zol BeShefa" stores to “Mega Bool” and five stores to "Zol BeShefa". In addition, we plan to continue to remodel some of our supermarkets to give them a more “upscale” orientation, offering improved product selection and increased focus on customer service. In 2012, we plan to open approximately 16 additional supermarkets, totaling approximately 15,000 square meters of store space, in localities whose populations are currently under-served by supermarkets or in localities in which we do not have sufficient market presence. In 2012, until March 31, 2012, we opened four supermarket stores. In 2012, we are taking action to further increase our market share of “Non-Food” and “Near-Food” products and to offer a wider selection of these products to consumers in our stores with the goal of increasing the portion of our customers’ overall shopping needs that are addressed in our stores. In addition, we intend to continue our expansion into the stand alone Non Food stores market by opening approximately 10 additional stores that are self-operating stores or operated by franchisees and to capitalize on potential synergies and an internal reorganization in order to improve our operating efficiency. Between 20 and 25 stores that had been operated by a franchisee became self-operating stores during 2012. 138 Dor Alon anticipates opening and operating an additional 14-18 commercial and fueling sites during 2012 and 2013. Dor Alon has plans and agreements to plan, establish and operate additional fueling stations, and these stations are currently in different stages of authorization and establishment. Dor Alon also anticipates opening and operating approximately 20 convenience stores during 2012 and 2013. In 2012, in order to improve our market share, we are looking to further broaden the variety of products offered under our private label and to improve our distribution capabilities by investing in a new distribution center, which should begin working at the end of 2013.

As of March 2012, 750,760 options out of the 2008 plan had been exercised. 147 In January 2010, our controlling shareholder, Alon, granted an option to D.B.W Investments Ltd. a company controlled by Mr. David Weissman, Alon's president and our Executive Chairman of the Board, to purchase 766,020 of our shares held by Alon, representing approximately 1.16% of our outstanding shares, as of March 31, 2012. The option is exercisable in five equal portions at the end of each calendar year from 2010 until 2014 and for a period of 18 months from the time each portion vests. C.Board Practices Appointment of Directors and Terms of Officers Our directors, other than our external directors, are elected by our shareholders at an annual general shareholders’ meeting and hold office until the next annual general shareholders’ meeting which is required to be held at least once in every calendar year, but not more than fifteen months after the last preceding annual general shareholders’ meeting. Until the next annual general shareholders’ meeting, the board of directors or shareholders may elect new directors to fill vacancies on, or increase the number of, members of the board of directors in a special meeting of the shareholders. Our board of directors may appoint any other person as a director. Any director so appointed may hold office until the first general shareholders’ meeting convened after the appointment and may be re-elected. Pursuant to the Israeli Companies Law, 1999, one may not be elected and may not serve as a director in a public company if he or she does not have the required qualifications and the ability to dedicate an appropriate amount of time for the performance of his duties as a director in the company, taking into consideration, among other things, the special needs and size of the company. In addition, a public company may convene an annual general meeting of shareholders to elect a director, and may elect such director, only if prior to such shareholders meeting, the nominee declares, among other things, that (s)he possess all of the required qualifications to serve as a director (and lists such qualifications in such declaration) and that he has the ability to dedicate an appropriate amount of time for the performance of his duties as a director of the company. Under the Israeli Companies Law, the entering by a public company into a contract with a non-controlling director as to the terms of his office, including exculpation, indemnification or insurance, requires the approval of the audit committee, the board of directors and the shareholders of the Company. The appointment and terms of office of all our officers, other than directors and the general manager (Chief Executive Officer), are determined by the general manager, subject to the approval of our board of directors, audit committee and/or compensation committee. We and our subsidiaries have no service contract with any of our directors that provide for benefits upon termination of their employment as directors. 148 Substitute Directors Our Articles of Association provide that any director may appoint another person to serve as a substitute director and may cancel such appointment. The identity of a substitute director requires the approval of the board of directors. Under the Israeli Companies Law, a person who is not himself qualified to be appointed as a director, a person who is already serving as a director or a person who is already serving as a substitute director for another director, may not be appointed as a substitute director. Nevertheless, a director who is already serving as a director may be appointed as a substitute director for a committee of the board of directors so long as (s)he is not already serving as a member of such committee, and if the substitute director is to replace an external director, (s)he is required to qualify as an external director and to have either “financial and accounting expertise” or “professional expertise”, depending on the qualifications of the external director (s)he is replacing. Otherwise, a substitute director cannot be appointed as an external director. The term of appointment of a substitute director may be for one meeting of the board of directors or until notice is given of the cancellation of the appointment. To our knowledge, no director currently intends to appoint any other person as a substitute director, except if the director is unable to attend a meeting of the board of directors. Independent and External Directors Israeli Companies Law Requirements We are subject to the provisions of the Israeli Companies Law. The Minister of Justice has adopted regulations exempting companies, like Alon Holdings, whose shares are traded outside of Israel, from some provisions of the Israeli Companies Law. Under the Israeli Companies Law, companies incorporated under the laws of Israel whose shares are either (i) listed for trading on a stock exchange or (ii) have been offered to the public in or outside of Israel, and are held by the public (Public Company) are required to appoint at least two external directors. The Israeli Companies Lawprovides that a person may not be appointed as an external director if the person is a relative of the controlling shareholder or if the person or the person’s relative, partner, employer, someone to whom he is subordinated directly or indirectly or any entity under the person’s control, has, as of the date of the person’s appointment to serve as external director, or had, during the two years preceding that date, any affiliation with us, our controlling, any relative of our controlling shareholder, as of the date of the person’s appointment to serve as external director, or any entity in which, currently or within the two years preceding the appointment date, the controlling shareholder was the company or the company's controlling shareholder; and in a company without a controlling shareholder or without a shareholder holding 25% or more of the voting rights in the company – any affiliation to the chairman of the board of directors, to the general manager (Chief Executive Officer), to a shareholder holding 5% or more of the company's shares or voting rights, or to the chief officer in any field as of the date of the person’s appointment. The term “affiliation” includes: ·an employment relationship; 149 ·a business or professional relationship maintained on a regular basis; ·control; and ·service as an office holder, other than service as a director who was appointed in order to serve as an external director of a company when such company was about to make an initial public offering. Without derogating from the above, a person may not serve as an external director if the person or the person’s relative, partner, employer, someone to whom he is subordinated directly or indirectly or any entity under the person’s control has business or professional relationship with an entity which an affiliation with is prohibited as detailed above, even if such relationship are not on a regular basis (excluding negligible relationship). In addition, a person who received compensation other than the compensation permitted by the Israeli Companies Law, may not serve as an external director. Regulations under the Israeli Companies Law, provide for various instances and kinds of relationships in which an external director will not be deemed to have “affiliation” with the public company for which (s)he serves, or is a candidate for serving as an external director. No person can serve as an external director if the person’s positions or other businesses create, or may create, a conflict of interests with the person’s responsibilities as a director or may impair his or her ability to serve as a director. In addition, a person who is a director of a company may not be elected as an external director of another company if, at that time, a director of the other company is acting as an external director of the first company. Until the lapse of two years from termination of office, a company, its controlling shareholder, or a company controlled by him may not engage an external director, or his spouse, or his child to serve as an office holder in the company or in any entity controlled by the controlling shareholder and cannot employ or receive professional services for consideration from that person, and may not grant such person any benefit either directly or indirectly, including through a corporation controlled by that person. The same restrictions above apply to relatives other than a spouse or a child, but such limitations shall only apply for one year from the date such external director ceased to be engaged in such capacity. In addition, if at the time an external director is appointed all current members of the board of directors, who are neither controlling shareholders nor relatives of controlling shareholders, are of the same gender, then the external director to be appointed must be of the other gender. 150 Under the Companies Law, a public company is required to appoint as an external director, a person who has "professional expertise" or a person who has "financial and accounting expertise," provided that at least one of the external directors must have "financial and accounting expertise". Under regulations, a director having financial and accounting expertise is a person who, due to his or her education, experience and qualifications is highly skilled in respect of, and understands, business-accounting matters and financial reports in a manner that enables him or her to understand in depth the company’s financial statements and to stimulate discussion regarding the manner in which the financial data is presented. Under the regulations, a director having professional expertise is a person who has an academic degree in either economics, business administration, accounting, law or public administration or other academic degree or has completed other higher education studies, all in an area relevant to the main business sector of the company or in a relevant area for the board position, or has at least five years experience in one of the following or at least five years of aggregate experience in two or more of the following: a senior management position in the business of a corporation with a substantial scope of business, in a senior position in the public service or a senior position in the main field of the company’s business. Under the Companies Law, each Israeli public company is required to determine the minimum number of directors with “accounting and financial expertise” that such company believes is appropriate in light of the company’s type, size, the scope and complexity of its activities and other factors. Once a company has made this determination, it must ensure that the necessary appointments to the board are made in accordance with this determination. Our board of directors determined that two directors with “accounting and financial expertise” is appropriate for the Company. Our board of directors currently has at least two directors with such “accounting and financial expertise”. External directors are to be elected by a majority vote at a shareholders’ meeting, provided that either (1) the majority of shares voted at the meeting, including at least a majority of the votes of the shareholders who are not controlling shareholders (as defined in the Israeli Companies Law) and do not have a personal interest in the appointment (excluding a personal interest which did not result from the shareholder’s relationship with the controlling shareholder), vote in favor of the election of the director without taking abstentions into account; or (2) the total number of shares of the abovementioned shareholders voted against the election of the external director does not exceed two percent of the aggregate voting rights in the company. The initial term of an external director is three years and may be extended for two additional three-year terms under certain circumstances and conditions. Nevertheless, Regulations under the Israeli Companies Law provide that companies, like Alon Holdings (whose shares are listed for trading both on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and on the New York Stock Exchange), may appoint an external director for additional three-year terms, under certain circumstances and conditions. External director may be removed only in a general meeting, by the same percentage of shareholders as is required for their election, or by a court, and in both cases only if the external directors cease to meet the statutory qualifications for their appointment, if they violate their duty of loyalty to us. Each committee authorized to exercise any of the powers of our board of directors is required to include at least one external director and our audit committee is required to include all of the external directors. An external director is entitled to compensation and reimbursement of expenses in accordance with regulations promulgated under the Israeli Companies Law and is otherwise prohibited from receiving any other compensation, directly or indirectly, in connection with serving as a director except for certain exculpation, indemnification and insurance provided by the company. 151 David Alphandary and Uzi Baram currently serve as Alon Holdings external directors. New York Stock Exchange Requirements See below “- Audit Committees - New York Stock Exchange Requirements” for a description of the independence requirements for audit committee members under applicable NYSE rules. Audit Committees Israeli Companies Law Requirements Under the Israeli Companies Law, the board of directors of a public company must appoint an audit committee, comprised of at least three directors including all of the external directors. The majority of the members of the audit committee, as well as the majority of members present at audit committee meetings, must be "independent" (as such term is defined below) and the chairman of the audit committee must be an external director. In addition, the following are disqualified from serving as members of the audit committee: the chairman of the board of directors, the controlling shareholder and his relatives, any director employed by the company or by its controlling shareholder or by an entity controlled by the controlling shareholder, a director who regularly provides services to the company or to its controlling shareholder or to an entity controlled by the controlling shareholder, and any director who derives most of its income from the controlling shareholder. An “Independent Director” is defined as an external director or a director who meets the following conditions: (i) satisfies certain conditions for appointment as an external director (as described above) and the audit committee has determined that such conditions have been met and (ii) he or she has not served as a director of the company for more than nine consecutive years, with any interruption of up to two years in his or her service not being deemed a disruption in the continuity of such service. The role of the audit committee is to examine flaws in our business management, in consultation with the internal auditor or our independent accountants and suggest appropriate course of action in order to correct such flaws. In addition, the approval of the audit committee is required to effect specified actions and related party transactions. Additional functions to be performed by the audit committee include, among others, the following: determination whether certain related party actions and transactions are "material" or "extraordinary" for purposes of the requisite approval procedures; to assess the scope of work and compensation of the company's independent accountant; to assess the company's internal audit system and the performance of its internal auditor and if the necessary resources have been made available to the internal auditor considering the company's needs and size; and to determine arrangements for handling complaints of employees in relation to flaws in the business management of the company and the protection for such employees. 152 New York Stock Exchange Requirements Under New York Stock Exchange rules, Alon Holdings is required to maintain an audit committee consisting only of independent directors. The independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Act implement two basic criteria for determining independence: (i) audit committee members are barred from accepting directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer, other than in the member's capacity as a member of the board of directors and any board committee, and (ii) audit committee members may not be an "affiliated person" of the issuer or any subsidiary of the issuer apart from his or her capacity as a member of the board and any board committee. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has defined "affiliate" for non-investment companies as "a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified." The term "control" is intended to be consistent with the other definitions of this term under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as "the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise." A safe harbor has been adopted by the SEC, under which a person who is not an executive officer or 10% shareholder of the issuer would be deemed not to have control of the issuer. The SEC has also provided certain limited exceptions for an audit committee member, who also sits on the board of directors of an affiliate to a listed issuer, so long as, except for being a director on such board of directors, the audit committee member otherwise meets the independence requirements for each entity. The role of the audit committee for New York Stock Exchange purposes includes assisting the board of directors in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and reporting practices of Alon Holdings. Corporate Governance Practices Internal Auditor Under the Israeli Companies Law, the board of directors must also appoint an internal auditor proposed by the audit committee. The role of the internal auditor is, among others, to examine whether our actions comply with the law and orderly business procedure. Under the Israeli Companies Law, the internal auditor may not be an interested party, an office holder, a relative of an interested party, or an office holder, nor may the internal auditor be our independent accountant or its representative. We comply with this requirement. Mr. Gershon Lewinsky serves as our internal auditor. 153 Duties of Office Holders and Approval of Specified Related Party Transactions Under Israeli Law Fiduciary Duties of Office Holders The Israeli Companies Law imposes a duty of care and a duty of loyalty on all office holders of a company, including directors and executive officers. The duty of care requires an office holder to act with the level of care, according to which a reasonable office holder in the same position would have acted under the same circumstances. The duty of care includes a duty to use reasonable means to obtain: ·information on the appropriateness of a given action brought for his approval or performed by him by virtue of his position; and ·all other important information pertaining to the previous actions. The duty of loyalty requires an office holder to act in good faith and for the benefit of the company, and includes a duty to: ·refrain from any action involving conflict of interest between the performance of his duties in the company and his personal affairs; ·refrain from any activity that is competitive with the company's business; ·refrain from usurping any business opportunity of the company to receive a personal gain for himself or others; and ·disclose to the company any information or documents relating to a company’s affairs which the office holder has received due to his position as an office holder. Under the Israeli Companies Law, directors’ compensation arrangements require audit committee approval, board of directors’ approval and shareholder approval. The Israeli Companies Law requires that an office holder of a company promptly and, in any event, not later than the first board meeting at which the transaction is discussed, disclose any personal interest that he may have and all related material fact or document known to him, in connection with any existing or proposed transaction by the company. A personal interest of an office holder includes a personal interest of his relative, of a company in which the office holder or his relative is, a shareholder which holds 5% or more of company's share capital or its voting rights, a director or a general manager, or in which he or she has the right to appoint at least one director or the general manager. A personal interest also includes a personal interest of a person who votes according to a proxy of another person, even if the other person has no personal interest, and a personal interest of a person who gave a proxy to another person to vote on his behalf – all whether the discretion how to vote lies with the person voting or not. In the case of an extraordinary transaction, the office holder’s duty to disclose applies also to a personal interest of the office holder’s relative. 154 Under Israeli law, an extraordinary transaction is a transaction: ·other than in the ordinary course of business; ·other than on market terms; or ·that is likely to have a material impact on the company’s profitability, assets or liabilities. Under the Israeli Companies Law, once an office holder complies with the above disclosure requirement, the board of directors may approve an ordinary transaction between the company and an office holder, or a third party in which an office holder has a personal interest, unless the articles of association provide otherwise. A transaction that is adverse to the company’s interest cannot be approved. Subject to certain exceptions, the audit committee and the board of directors must approve the conditions and term of office of an office holder (which is not a director). If the transaction is an extraordinary transaction, both the audit committee and the board of directors, in that order, must approve the transaction. Under specific circumstances, shareholders approval may also be required. Whoever has a personal interest in a matter, which is considered at a meeting of the board of directors or the audit committee, may not be present at this meeting or vote on this matter. However, if the chairman of the board of directors or the chairman of the audit committee has determined that the presence of such person is required to present a matter to the meeting, such officer holder may be present at the meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the majority of the directors have a personal interest in a matter, a director who has the personal interest in this matter may be present at this meeting or vote on this matter, but the board of directors decision requires the shareholder approval. Controlling Shareholder Transactions and Actions Under the Israeli Companies Law, the disclosure requirements which apply to an office holder also apply to a controlling shareholder of a public company and to a person who would become a controlling shareholder as a result of a private placement. A controlling shareholder includes a person who has the ability to direct the activities of a company, other than if this power derives solely from his/her position on the board of directors or any other position with the company. In addition, for such purposes a controlling shareholder includes a shareholder that holds 25% or more of the voting rights in a public company if no other shareholder owns more than 50% of the voting rights in the company. Extraordinary transactions with a controlling shareholder or in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest, including a private placement in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest; and the terms of engagement of the company, directly or indirectly, with a controlling shareholder or his or her relative (including through a corporation controlled by a controlling shareholder), regarding the company’s receipt of services from the controlling shareholder, and if such controlling shareholder is also an office holder of the company or an employee, regarding his or her terms of office and employment, require the approval of the audit committee, the board of directors and the shareholders of the company, in that order. The shareholders approval must include either: 155 ·a majority of the shareholders who have no personal interest in the transaction and who are participating in the voting, in person, by proxy or by written ballot, at the meeting (votes abstaining shall not be taken into account); or ·the total number of shares voted against the proposal by shareholders without a personal interest does not exceed two percent (2%) of the aggregate voting rights in the Company. In addition, any such transaction whose term is more than three years, requires the abovementioned approval every three years, unless (with respect to transactions not involving receiving of services or compensation) the audit committee approves that a longer term is reasonable under the circumstances. However, under Regulations, promulgated pursuant to the Israeli Companies Law, certain transactions between a company and its controlling shareholder(s) (or the controlling shareholder’s relative) do not require shareholder approval. For information concerning the direct and indirect personal interests of certain of our office holders and principal shareholders in certain transactions with us, see “Item 7. Major Shareholders – B. Related Party Transactions.” The Israeli Companies Law requires that every shareholder that participates, either by proxy or in person, in a vote regarding a transaction with a controlling shareholder indicate whether or not that shareholder has a personal interest in the vote in question, the failure of which results in the invalidation of that shareholder’s vote. The Israeli Companies Law further provides that an acquisition of shares in a public company must be made by means of a tender offer if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser would become a holder of 45% of the voting rights of the company, unless there is a holder of more than 45% of the voting rights of the company or would become a holder of 25% of the voting rights unless there is another person holding 25% of the voting rights. This restriction does not apply to: (i) an acquisition of shares in a private placement, if the acquisition had been approved in a shareholders meeting under certain circumstances; (ii) an acquisition of shares from a holder of at least 25% of the voting rights, as a result of which a person would become a holder of at least 25% of the voting rights; and (iii) an acquisition of shares from a holder of more than 45% of the voting rights, as a result of which the acquirer would become a holder of more than 45% of the voting rights in the company. Regulations under the Israeli Companies Law provide that the Israeli Companies Law’s tender offer rules do not apply to a company whose shares are publicly traded outside of Israel, if, pursuant to the applicable foreign laws or stock exchange rules, there is a restriction on the acquisition of any level of control of the company, or if the acquisition of any level of control of the company requires the purchaser to make a tender offer to the public shareholders. It is the view of the Israeli Securities Authority, that U.S. securities laws and stock exchange rules do not impose the required restriction on the acquisition of any level of control of a company, and therefore the Israeli Companies Law’s special tender offer rules would apply to a company whose shares are publicly traded in the United States. 156 The Israeli Companies Law further provides that a shareholder has a duty to act in good faith towards the company and other shareholders when exercising his rights and duties and shall refrain from oppressing other shareholders, including in connection with the voting at a shareholders’ meeting on: (i) any amendment to the articles of association; (ii) an increase in the company’s authorized share capital; (iii) a merger; or (iv) approval of certain transactions with control persons and other related parties, which require shareholder approval. In addition, any controlling shareholder, any shareholder who knows that it possesses power to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote and any shareholder who, pursuant to the provisions of a company’s Articles of Association, has the power to appoint or prevent the appointment of an office holder in the company, or has any other power over the company, is under a duty to act with fairness towards the company. Under the Companies Law, the laws that apply to a breach of a contract will generally also apply to a breach of duty of fairness. Exemption, Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Officers Office Holder Exemption Under the Israeli Companies Law, a company may not exempt an officer or director (each, an "Office Holder") from liability with respect to a breach of his duty of loyalty, but may exempt in advance an Office Holder from his liability to the company, in whole or in part, with respect to a breach of his duty of care (except in connection with a prohibited distribution made by the company) if so provided in its articles of association. Our Articles of Association so provide. Following approval by our audit committee and board of directors, on June 12, 2008 our shareholders approved a resolution exempting the Company's directors and officers, including any of the Company's controlling shareholders who serve as directors or officers of the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by law, from liability towards the Company with respect to any damage caused or that will be caused to the Company by its directors and officers as a result of a breach of their duty of care toward the Company or following a bona fide action taken by them in the connection with their position in the Company, including actions taken while serving as directors or officers in another company, in connection with their position in the Company. BSRE previously approved a prospective (in advance) exemption to BSRE's directors and officers from liability for damage resulting from a breach of his duty of care towards BSRE in connection with actions taken in good faith in their capacity as a director and/or officer of BSRE or in their capacity as an officer of another company at the request of BSRE. 157 Office Holder Insurance The Israeli Companies Law and our Articles of Association provide that, subject to the provisions of the Israeli Companies Law, we may enter into a contract for the insurance of the liability of any of our Office Holders for any act performed by him in his capacity as an Office Holder with respect to any of the following: ·a breach of such Office Holder's duty of care to the Company or to another person; ·a breach of such Office Holder's duty of loyalty to the Company, provided that the Office Holder acted in good faith and had reasonable cause to assume that his act would not prejudice the Company’s interests; ·a financial liability imposed upon such Office Holder in favor of another person; or ·a breach of any duty or any other obligation, to the extent insurance may be permitting by law. Pursuant to resolutions adopted by our shareholders, we participate in a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy acquired by Alon. The insurance policy is for a period beginning on January 1, 2012, and ending on December 31, 2012 covering the Company and affiliated entities, including Dor Alon and its subsidiaries, BSRE and its subsidiaries, and Alon and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”). Such policy would cover a total liability of US $50 million (for each claim and in the aggregate) for the Company, including legal fees, and US $30 million (for each claim and in the aggregate), including legal fees, for each of the other members of the Group, excluding the Company, provided that in any event the maximum aggregate coverage of liability for the entire Group would be US $50 million. Our audit committee, board of directors and shareholders have also approved any renewal of the insurance policy or the participation by the Company in future directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies covering the Company and all or some members of the Group, under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original insurance, upon its expiration, for a period of up to an additional four years from the end of the term of the original insurance policy. The participation in any future insurance policies would be subject to the following conditions: (i) the determination by the audit committee and board of directors that there will be no substantive changes between the original insurance policy and the future insurance policies; a change to the scope of coverage under the future insurance policies will not be deemed to be substantive so long as the premium paid by the Group for such future insurance policies will be as described in section (ii) below; and (ii) the premium paid for the future insurance policies will not increase by more than the greater of (A) 25% over the cost of the premium paid for the insurance policy of the previous year; or (B) 25% over the cost of the premium paid for the original insurance policy (in each case plus the rate of depreciation of the NIS in relation to the U.S. dollar, to the extent such a depreciation occurred). 158 Indemnification of Office Holders The Israeli Companies Law provides that a company may indemnify an Office Holder for the following liabilities or expenses imposed on him as a result of an act performed in his capacity as an Office Holder of the company, provided the company's articles of association include the following provisions with respect to indemnification: ·a provision authorizing the company to indemnify an Office Holder for future events with respect to a monetary liability imposed on him in favor of another person pursuant to a judgment (including a judgment given in a settlement or an arbitrator’s award approved by the court), so long as such indemnification is limited to types of events which, in the board of directors' opinion, are foreseeable at the time of granting the indemnity undertaking in view of the company’s actual business, and in such amount or standard as the board of directors deems reasonable under the circumstances. Such undertaking must specify the events that, in the board of directors’ opinion, are foreseeable in view of the company’s actual business at the time of the undertaking and the amount or the standards that the board of directors deemed reasonable at the time; ·a provision authorizing the company to indemnify an Office Holder for future events with respect to reasonable litigation expenses, including counsel fees, incurred by an Office Holder or which he is ordered to pay by a court, in proceedings that the company institutes against him or instituted on behalf of the company or by another person, or in a criminal charge from which he was acquitted, or a criminal charge in which he was convicted for a criminal offense that does not require proof of criminal intent; ·a provision authorizing the company to indemnify an Office Holder for future events with respect to reasonable litigation fees, including attorney’s fees, incurred by an Office Holder in consequence of an investigation or proceeding filed against him by an authority that is authorized to conduct such investigation or proceeding, and that resulted without filing an indictment against him and without imposing on him financial obligation in lieu of a criminal proceeding, or that resulted without filing an indictment against him but with imposing on him a financial obligation as an alternative to a criminal proceeding in respect of an offense that does not require the proof of criminal intent or in connection with a monetary sanction; and ·a provision authorizing the company to retroactively indemnify an Office Holder. On June 12, 2008, following approval of our audit committee and board of directors, our shareholders approved amendments to our Articles of Association pertaining to indemnification of directors and officers that reflect the provisions of the Israeli Companies Law described above. 159 Our Articles of Association provide that we may undertake to indemnify an Office Holder for obligations or expenses imposed on him as a result of an act done in his capacity as an Office Holder in the Company or as a result of being an Office Holder, in another company in which the Company holds shares or has interests, as specified above. Our Articles of Association further provide that the aggregate amount of indemnification (in addition to any insurance proceeds received) shall not exceed 25% of the shareholders’ equity of the Company, as set forth in the Company’s most recent consolidated financial statements prior to the applicable payment of indemnification. Limitations on Insurance, Exemption and Indemnification The Israeli Companies Law and our Articles of Association provide that a company may not exempt or indemnify an Office Holder nor enter into an insurance contract, which would provide coverage for any monetary liability incurred as a result of any of the following: ·a breach by the Office Holder of his duty of loyalty, except for insurance and indemnification where the Office Holder acted in good faith and had a reasonable basis to believe that the act would not prejudice the company; ·a breach by the Office Holder of his duty of care if the breach was done intentionally or recklessly (except if the breach was solely as a result of negligence); ·any act or omission done with the intent to derive an illegal personal benefit; or ·any fine, civil fine, monetary sanctions, or forfeit imposed on the Office Holder. In addition, under the Israeli Companies Law, exemption of, indemnification of, and procurement of insurance coverage for, our Office Holders must be approved by our audit committee and board of directors and, in specified circumstances, by our shareholders. Letters of Indemnification Our audit committee, board of directors and general shareholders meeting approved in February 2001 the grant of indemnification and exemption letters to our directors and officers, including those directors and officers whose term of service ended on or after September 1, 2000. In April 2002, the general shareholders meeting approved the grant of a new letter of indemnification and exemption to the officers and directors of the Company. The aggregate amount of the indemnification (in addition to any insurance proceeds received) may not exceed 25% of our shareholders’ equity (in U.S. dollars) as stated in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2000, for all persons and events. Under the indemnification and exemption letters, we agreed to indemnify these directors and officers, retroactively with respect to events occurring after February 1, 2000, the date on which the Israeli Companies Law became effective and prospectively, in connection with specified issues. 160 On June 12, 2008, following approval of our audit committee and board of directors, our shareholders approved the grant of new indemnification letters to the Company's directors and officers (and to those who will serve as its directors and officers from time to time). The aggregate amount of the indemnification (in addition to any insurance proceeds received) may not exceed 25% of the Company's equity as set forth in the Company's most recent consolidated financial statements prior to the applicable payment of indemnification.

The collective bargaining agreements in effect as of that date apply to Alon Holdings as if Alon Holdings and these employees were originally parties to these agreements. Alon Holdings became responsible for the payment of all employee benefits that had been accrued in respect of these employees during the term of employment of these employees with the Co-Op, to the extent these benefits were recorded on the Co-Op’s records. Since 1996, we entered into new labor agreements with the Histadrut and the Co-Op union, which determine our employees wages structure, the employment conditions of new employees and a wage increase to the existing employees. The above applies to Mega Retail employees. On January 1, 2011, substantially all of the employees of Alon Holdings were transferred to Mega Retail. Israeli law generally requires the payment by employers of severance pay upon the retirement or death of an employee or upon termination of employment by the employer or, in some circumstances, by the employee. We currently fund ongoing severance obligations by making monthly payments to pension funds, employee accounts in a provident fund and insurance policies. In addition, Israeli employees and employers are required to pay specified amounts to the National Insurance Institute, which is similar to the U.S. Social Security Administration. Since January 1, 1995, these amounts also include payments for national health insurance payable by employees. Most of our employees are covered by a pension fund. Our senior employees are covered by general and/or individual life and pension insurance policies providing customary benefits to employees, including retirement and severance benefits. 164 E.Share Ownership.

B.Related Party Transactions. Agreement with the Wholesale Market Company On June 3, 2010, BSRE, Gindi Investments 1 Ltd. and an additional entity controlled by Moshe and Yigal Gindi (together with Gindi Investments 1 Ltd., "Gindi") (through two subsidiaries owned 50% by BSRE and 50% by Gindi) (the "Purchasers") signed agreements with the Municipality of Tel Aviv and the Wholesale Market Company (collectively, the “Sellers”) to acquire rights to a long term lease of property in the wholesale market site in Tel Aviv (the "Property"). One of the Sellers was Tnuva, and to our knowledge, some of the collective acquisition entities of kibbutzim in Israel that hold shares of Alon, our controlling shareholder, hold 23% of the shares of Tnuva. In addition, our director, Yitzhak Bader, also serves as a director on the board of directors of Tnuva. On June 2, 2010, the shareholders of BSRE approved the signing of the final agreements. The agreements were approved by the Israeli Minister of the Interior in July 2010. The long term lease on the Property is until August 31, 2099, and the Purchasers, including BSRE, intend to plan, build and market on such Property an apartment buildings complex and a shopping mall (the "Project"). The Property consists of building rights of approximately 97,460 square meters, of which approximately 62,640 square meters are designated for residential use, approximately 10,320 square meters are designated for mixed use (including for residential, office and/or retirement home use), and approximately 24,500 square meters are designated for commercial use, part of which would be located on the ground floor of the residential buildings. The Purchasers are to pay the Sellers a purchase price of NIS 950 million payable in three installments. In addition to the purchase price, the Sellers may be entitled to additional consideration calculated as a percentage of the sale price of apartments that are sold in the apartment buildings complex, as described in the agreement. As of March 31, 2012, the Purchasers had exercised their right under the agreements to pay the first installment and had made a payment in the amount of approximately NIS 258.7 million to the Purchasers. 167 Within the framework of the purchase agreements, the Purchasers have committed to plan and build a community sports center and a school on an approximately 10,000 square meter nearby public property and certain public community institutions on an approximately 2,430 square meter property that is within the area of the apartment building complex, and 85 parking spaces (collectively, the "Public Buildings"). The Sellers are to bear the expense of building the Public Buildings and are to pay the Purchasers a fee (linked to the Building Index) calculated as cost plus 10% plus VAT, based on certain milestones detailed in the agreement, up to a maximum of approximately NIS 84 to 102 million. Any expenses that exceed this limit are to be borne by the Purchasers. The Purchasers also committed to build an additional 40 parking spaces and to develop, at their own expense, an open public space within the area of the Project on an area of nine dunam, which would remain under the exclusive ownership of the municipality of Tel Aviv. The Purchasers obtained a firm commitment letter from a bank, in a form acceptable to the Sellers, pursuant to which the bank certified that it will provide the Purchasers financing to complete the purchase of the Property, subject to certain conditions. In an agreement of principles signed with Gindi, BSRE agreed to pay 60% of the first installment of the consideration in the amount of NIS 260 million, and any additional payment that may be required to further the project, until the payment of the second installment, if such payment amount cannot be obtained within the framework of a credit line provided by a bank. BSRE will be eligible to receive the excess amount (above its 50% share of the project), including interest, not later than eight years after the date on which the agreement of principles was signed. On May 20, 2010, most of the first installment of the consideration to be paid by BSRE was transferred to a trustee. Gindi is to provide management services for the Project in exchange for a management fee to be paid by the Purchasers and calculated as 16% of the profits from the Project, all subject to various terms of the agreement of principles between the parties. In addition, they determined material issues regarding the construction and the management of the parking lot in which an unanimously decision is required, and principles regarding dilution of each of the parties' rights in the event that one of the parties will not invest the amounts that such party obligated to invest. On February 21, 2011, Tel Aviv’s planning and building committee approved in principle an application by the Purchasers to change the architectural design plans of the Project. Within the framework of the approved changes (i) the Project will include 10 buildings in each building consisting of 14 floors each, (ii) the Project will include 718 residential units for sale and 54 units which will be leased in accordance with certain criteria determined by the Municipality of Tel Aviv and the Purchasers, and (iii) 3,420 square meters which was originally zoned as a “multi-purpose” lot was designated for commercial use. On April 10, 2011, a construction works permit was received subject to certain obligations of the Purchasers and construction work has began. During March 2012, a basements permit was received. As of March 13, 2012, 489 sale agreements had been signed and advance payments in the aggregate amount of NIS 244 million (including VAT) had been received from the purchasers. 168 Purchase of Property in Point Wells, Washington from Indirect Subsidiary of Alon On June 1, 2010, BSRE completed the acquisition of an approximately 240-dunam parcel of property in Point Wells, near Seattle, Washington, which serves primarily as a plant for storage and distribution of fuel and oils. BSRE purchased the property through a special purpose entity established in the United States, BSRE Point Wells, LP, which entered into a purchase agreement, dated May 7, 2010, with Paramount of Washington LLC (“POW”) for the property and into a development agreement, dated June 1, 2010, with POW and Paramount Petroleum Corporation (“PPC”). PPC leases the property from POW and operates and maintains it. POW and PPC are wholly owned subsidiaries of Alon USA Energy Inc., a public company whose shares are traded on the NYSE ("Alon USA") and is controlled by our indirect controlling shareholder, Alon Israel Oil Co. Ltd. ("Alon"). BSRE Point Wells, LP paid POW a sum of $19.5 million in consideration for the rights in and to the property (apart from the buildings and the existing equipment/property on the property (including fuel storage tanks, technical systems, pipes and various installations) which remain under the ownership of POW). BSRE Point Wells, LP bore the expenses relating to the transaction, including the transfer tax (estimated at approximately $350,000) and ancillary costs for completion of the transfer of the rights in its name. Upon the closing of the transaction, BSRE Point Wells, LP granted POW and PPC a right of use of the property, for a consideration of approximately $440 thousand per quarter commencing July 1, 2010, for a period commencing on June 2, 2010 and terminating upon the earlier of: (1) June 2, 2020 or (2) the time of sale of the property, after the enhancement thereof, to a third party in accordance with the development agreement (the "License Period"). In the event BSRE sells the land, POW will have the right to participate in the consideration net of costs as defined in the agreement. The present land use designation of the property was changed to urban center zoning from its original land use designation which was heavy industrial. On May 12, 2010, the local Snomish County Council (the "Local Council") adopted (a) an ordinance approving the new Urban Center Code and, (b) and ordinance to change the zoning designation of Point Wells to Urban Center. The Urban Center Code and new zoning designation became effective on May 29, 2010. In March 2011, BSRE, through BSRE Point Wells, LP, submitted a detailed plan to the Local Council, which included plans for the building of three residential areas and public areas as well as development plans (the "Plan"), and in November 2011, the court determined that building permit will be provided only after completion of all the required adjustments pursuant to the local law and the aforementioned ordinances. BSRE filed an appeal on the court determination, and in the opinion of BSRE’s local counsel, no substantial delays in the development or zoning actions are expected, however, BSRE can not estimate the accurate time required to receive the final approval to fulfill the new land use designation. 169 According to the development agreement signed between the parties, BSRE Point Wells, LP will take action to initiate a detailed plan for approving the construction of at least 2000 residential units on the property. All of the expenses connected with the approval of the change of zoning, including the initiation and preparation of a detailed plan, will be borne by BSRE Point Wells, LP. BSRE assesses that these expenses will amount to approximately $4-5 million. If the detailed plan is not approved and/or if it does not contain at least 2000 residential units, BSRE Point Wells, LP will bear no responsibility to POW and/or PPC. In consideration for PPC’s right to participate in the development of the property and in the proceeds that will be received from the sale of the property to a third party after the enhancement thereof, PPC will pay BSRE Point Wells, LP quarterly participation fees in a sum of $438,750, which will be paid commencing from July 1, 2010 and throughout the entire License Period. The development agreement further stipulates provisions regarding a division of the consideration that will be received from the sale of the property to a third party after the change of zoning and enhancement of the property. Acquisition of Controlling Share in Dor-Alon Energy In Israel (1988) LTD. Alon Holdings and Alon, Alon Holdings' controlling shareholder, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, which was completed on October 3, 2010, that provided for the acquisition by Alon Holdings of Alon’s entire equity interest in Dor Alon (constituting approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of Dor Alon (not including treasury shares)), or the Transferred Shares, at the closing of the Acquisition. These shares constituted approximately 73.5% of the outstanding Dor Alon ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis as of the closing date of the acquisition. Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, in consideration for each share held by Alon in Dor Alon, Alon Holdings issued to Alon 1.8 ordinary shares of Alon Holdings, and in exchange for all the Transferred Shares, Alon Holdings issued to Alon 20,327,710 ordinary shares of Alon Holdings, or the Issued Shares. Immediately following the Acquisition, Alon beneficially owned in the aggregate, directly and indirectly, approximately 78.44% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Alon Holdings (as opposed to approximately 68.62% of the outstanding shares immediately prior to the Acquisition), and all other Alon Holdings shareholders owned approximately 21.56% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Alon Holdings (as opposed to approximately 31.38% of the outstanding ordinary shares immediately prior to the Acquisition). Upon completion of the Acquisition, Dor Alon became a majority-owned subsidiary of Alon Holdings and its shares have continued to trade on the TASE. As a condition to the closing of the Share Purchase Agreement, Alon Holdings paid to its shareholders on October 18, 2010 an aggregate cash dividend of NIS 800 million, or approximately US $223.4 million (based on the representative rate of exchange on October 18, 2010), which represented a dividend of approximately NIS 12.31, or approximately US $3.44 (based on the representative rate of exchange on October 18, 2010), per Alon Holdings ordinary share (after taking into account the shares to be issued to Alon in the acquisition, or the Dividend Distribution.

Alon’s indemnification obligation will apply only to damages in an aggregate amount of over ten million NIS (NIS 10,000,000). However if the accumulated amount of damages to Alon Holdings or Dor Alon exceeds this amount, then Alon’s indemnification obligation will apply to the full amount of damages. In connection with the proposed acquisition, Alon and Alon Holdings obtained a pre-ruling from the Israeli Tax Authority. The pre-ruling is subject to various conditions and provides, among other things, that the cost basis and the purchase date of the shares of Dor Alon for tax purposes in the possession of Alon Holdings following the acquisition will be the original price and acquisition date, respectively, as they had been for Alon prior to the acquisition. Alon has clarified to Alon Holdings that, in connection with the payment of tax at the time of any future sale by Alon Holdings of all or part of its shares in Dor Alon, if any, to a third party, Alon will pay that portion of any applicable tax payable in an amount equal to the amount of tax deferred by the Tax Authority in its pre-ruling (i.e., the amount of tax that would have been payable by Alon in connection with the acquisition had the acquisition not been tax exempt according to the pre-ruling).

In the event that Mega Retail's revenues generated from the Procurement Agreement minus related expenses from the sale of products to Dor Alon Management is less than NIS 1 million linked to the Israeli consumer price index in any year without VAT, Dor Alon Management will pay Mega Retail additional amounts in order that Mega Retail's income from such year will reach such NIS 1 million amount. To secure Dor Alon Station’s payment and other obligations to us under the Procurement Agreement, Dor Alon agreed to provide Mega Retail with a floating lien or pledge, unlimited in amount, on all inventory in the convenience stores, subject to any legal prevention, and Dor-Alon and Alon Israel Oil Company Ltd, the controlling shareholders of Dor Alon Management, will guarantee all obligations of Dor Alon Management under the agreement. 172 The term of the Procurement Agreement is for five years commencing from March 1, 2004, and will automatically be extended for additional one-year periods unless either party gives notice to the other party of its desire to terminate the Procurement Agreement 90 days prior to the expiration of the term of the Procurement Agreement or such year, as the case may be. In addition, with respect to convenience stores located in Dor Alon fuel service stations that are operated by third parties, Mega Retail have agreed that upon Dor Alon’s request, it may enter into separate agreements with respect to such stores with the third party operators of such stores on substantially similar terms as the Procurement Agreement described above. Dor-Alon and Alon Israel Oil Company Ltd. would also guarantee the obligations of such third party operators and Dor Alon Stations, under these related separate agreements. Transactions with Dor Alon in Connection with Establishment of a Joint Loyalty Plan On November 29, 2005, Alon Holdings entered into the following agreements with Dor-Alon: (i) an agreement establishing a joint loyalty plan for the benefit of Alon Holdings’ and Dor Alon’s customers, formed as a partnership to be held 75% by Alon Holdings and 25% by Dor Alon (the “Loyalty Plan”). Pursuant to the agreement, the partnership is governed by a managers board (the “Board”), which is comprised of six (6) members, four (4) of whom appointed by Alon Holdings (one of whom serves as the chairman of the Board), and two (2) of whom are appointed by Dor Alon; (ii) an agreement under which Alon Holdings and Dor Alon purchased 49% (36.75% Alon Holdings and 12.25% Dor Alon) of the shares of capital stock of Diners Club Israel Ltd. (“Diners Israel”) from Credit Cards for Israel Ltd. (“CAL”) for a total consideration of NIS 21.3 million (of which NIS 15.6 million was paid by Alon Holdings). The consideration was funded through a non-recourse loan granted by CAL to Alon Holdings and Dor Alon. The loan is for a period of eight years, is linked to the CPI and bears interest in an annual rate of 6%. The loan is to be repaid in a single payment at the end of the period. Repayment of the loan is secured only by the acquired shares. On May 25, 2011, the agreement was amended. Under the original agreement, the Company and Dor Alon were entitled to share with CAL the net income of Diners Israel in connection with the activities of the credit cards bearing the "You" name based on our respective ownership interests in Diners Israel. The percentage of the net income of Diners Israel in connection with its other credit card activities (i.e., those activities outside the Loyalty Plan) were to be allocated to Alon Holdings and Dor Alon based on the number of "activated" credit cards (as defined in the agreement) issued to members of the Loyalty Plan from time to time, so long as certain target numbers of such issued credit cards are met. In the event such target numbers were not met, Alon Holdings and Dor Alon were give the right, during the first three years following the issuance of the first Diners Israel credit card to a member of the Loyalty Plan (the "Issuance Date"), to purchase the right to the net income of Diners Israel arising from such other activities through a one-time payment. In addition, we signed an agreement with CAL pursuant to which Loyalty Plan members are to be issued Mastercard "You" credit cards that will be treated the same as the Diners "You" credit cards for the purpose of our agreement with Dor Alon. 173 On May 25, 2011, we agreed to an amendment to the agreement of principles between CAL, Diners Israel, Alon Holdings, Dor Alon, and the Alon Holdings-Dor Alon Joint Loyalty Plan Partnership, and in July 2011, all suspending conditions set forth in the agreement were completed, the amendment to the agreement came into effect. Pursuant to the amendment, Alon Holdings and Dor Alon would have the right to 49% of the profits of Diners Israel Ltd., both related to the "You" bearing credit cards, and to all other credit cards issued by Diners, effective as of January 1st, 2011 (with the exception of certain activities the profits of which is allocated to the parties per their respective holdings from July 1st, 2011). Alon Holdings and Dor Alon repaid the non-recourse loan granted to them by CAL for the purchase of the shares, in the amount of NIS 36 million. Additionally, the amendment sets the terms as to the business relationship between the parties, including cancellation mechanism in the event the Loyalty Plan is cancelled by the purchasers and specific provisions regarding distribution of dividends, and extends the agreement until December 31, 2015, following which the agreement will be extended for additional three-year terms based on the terms and conditions set forth in the amendment to the agreement. The amendment also includes a calculation method for the purchase of the 49% of Diners owned by us and by Dor Alon in the event the agreement between Diners and the Loyalty club not be extended. The Company and Dor Alon handled their financial statements by an agreement to buy Diners as option for purchasing stock options and recorded in the period income before taxes from revaluation of approximately NIS 102 million ($27.5 million).
