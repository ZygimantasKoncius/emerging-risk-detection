Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to certain business and legal risks including, but not limited to, the following: Risks Related to Our Status as a Real Estate Investment Trust Loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. 11 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under the Code. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a REIT and believe that our current organization and method of operation complies with the rules and regulations promulgated under the federal income tax code to enable us to qualify as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex federal income tax code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. New legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments. There can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes. If we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT: · we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; · we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; · unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and · we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities. Risks Related to Adverse Global Market and Economic Conditions Recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with slower growth and tighter credit conditions through the end of 2008. These adverse market conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses, maintain properties, pay dividends and refinance debt. The economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including: · changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; · local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; · the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; · the ability of tenants to pay rent; · competition from other available properties; · changes in market rental rates; · the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; · changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; · the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; and · changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes. The retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions have forced some weaker retailers, in some cases, to declare bankruptcy and close stores. Certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection. These downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on our performance. Continued store closings or declarations of bankruptcy by our tenants may have a material adverse effect on the Companys overall performance. Adverse general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the Company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the Companys ability to attract or retain tenants. 12 Our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. Our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space. In the future, the market for retail space could be adversely affected by: · weakness in the national, regional and local economies; · the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; · ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; · the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets; and · increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet. Failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise could impact our performance. Our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants. At any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. As a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants leases. In the event of a default by a tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of our leases. In addition, multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. In that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. The occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could have a material adverse effect on our performance. We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. A tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. A bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims it holds, if at all. Risks Related to Our Acquisition, Development, Operation, and Sale of Real Property We may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms. Real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. In addition, the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a REITs ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. Therefore, we may not be able to vary its portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms. We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks. We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. We face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert managements attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun purs uing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. Furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. In addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. 13 There is a lack of operating history with respect to our recent acquisitions and development of properties and we may not succeed in the integration or management of additional properties. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. As we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. In addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. We may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties. Also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. We face competition in leasing or developing properties. We face competition in the acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment. Some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do. This could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities. Risks Related to Our Joint Venture and Preferred Equity Investments We do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. We have invested in some cases as a co-venturer or partner in properties instead of owning directly. In these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. As a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with us, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives. If the co-venturer or partner defaults on their obligations, we may be required to fulfill their obligation ourselves. The co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. We may not be able to recover our investments in our joint venture or preferred equity investments, which may result in significant losses to us. Our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. Risks Related to Our International Operations We have significant international operations that carry additional risks. We invest in and conduct operations outside the United States. The risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: · currency risks, including currency fluctuations; · unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements; · potential adverse tax burdens; · burdens of complying with different permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws; · obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; · regional, national and local political uncertainty; · economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets; · difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and · reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries. Each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 14 Risks Related to Our Financing Activities We may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations and our financial condition. The capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile and constrained as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms. The inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business, such as: · we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which would materially adversely affect our business strategy; · our liquidity could be adversely affected; · we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; · we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness; and · we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. Financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. Our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. These covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. In addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities. Risks Related to the Market Price of Our Publicly Traded Securities Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: · the extent of institutional investor interest in us; · the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us; · the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); · our financial condition and performance; · the markets perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends; · an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and · general economic and financial market conditions. Risks Related to Our Marketable Securities and Mortgage Receivables We may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in significant losses to us. 15 Our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in significant losses to us. Marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. As a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of: · limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; · substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates; · subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer; · the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; and · the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. The issuers of our marketable securities also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. These risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments. We invest in mortgage receivables. Our investments in mortgage receivables normally are not insured or otherwise guaranteed by any institution or agency. In the event of a default by a borrower, it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. Delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. Furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. A decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. Our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. In these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. In these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. In the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected. Risks Related to Environmental Regulations We may be subject to environmental regulations. Under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). This liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2. Properties Real Estate Portfolio As of December 31, 2008, the Company's real estate portfolio was comprised of interests in approximately 160.8 million square feet of GLA in 1,407 operating properties primarily consisting of neighborhood and community shopping centers, and 16 retail store leases located in 45 states, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, and Peru. This 160.8 million square feet of GLA does not include 16 properties under development comprising 1.2 million square feet of GLA related to the Preferred Equity program, 29 property interests comprising 0.6 million square feet of GLA related to FNC Realty, 402 property interests comprising 2.3 million square feet of GLA related to a net lease portfolio, 49 property interests comprising 2.4 million square feet of GLA related to the NewKirk Portfolio and 13.3 million square feet of planned GLA for 47 ground-up development projects. The Companys portfolio includes interests ranging from 5% to 50% in 481 shopping center properties comprising approximately 73.5 million square feet of GLA relating to the Companys investment management programs and other joint ventures. Neighborhood and community shopping centers comprise the primary focus of the Company's current portfolio. As of December 31, 2008, the Companys total shopping center portfolio, comprised of total GLA of 126.9 million from 893 properties, was approximately 93.9% leased. 16 The Company's neighborhood and community shopping center properties, which are generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint ventures, had an average size of approximately 142,000 square feet as of December 31, 2008. The Company generally retains its shopping centers for long-term investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical maintenance together with major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and increase the value of its properties. These projects usually include renovating existing facades, installing uniform signage, resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot lighting. During 2008, the Company capitalized approximately $16.1 million in connection with these property improvements and expensed to operations approximately $21.4 million. The Company's neighborhood and community shopping centers are usually "anchored" by a national or regional discount department store, supermarket or drugstore. As one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nation's largest owners and operators of shopping centers, the Company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers. Some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the Company's shopping center properties include The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohls, Wal-Mart, Royal Ahold, Best Buy, Bed Bath and Beyond and Costco. A substantial portion of the Company's income consists of rent received under long-term leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed-base rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers. Although many of the leases require the Company to make roof and structural repairs as needed, a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant, and the Company's standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance. The Company's management places a strong emphasis on sound construction and safety at its properties. Approximately 22.8% of the Company's leases also contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds. Percentage rents accounted for less than 1% of the Company's revenues from rental property for the year ended December 31, 2008. Additionally, a majority of the Companys leases have built-in contractual rent increases as well as escalation clauses. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. Minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 99% of the Company's total revenues from rental property for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company's management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the Company's existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing market-rate base rents in the geographic regions where the Company operates, reflecting the potential for future growth. As of December 31, 2008, the Companys consolidated portfolio, comprised of 53.4 million of GLA, was 93.2% leased. For the period January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008, the Company increased the average base rent per leased square foot in its consolidated portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers from $10.35 to $10.69, an increase of $0.34. This increase primarily consists of (i) a $0.01 increase relating to acquisitions, (ii) a $0.12 increase relating to dispositions or the transfer of properties to various joint venture entities and (iii) a $0.21 increase relating to new leases signed net of leases vacated and rent step-ups within the portfolio. The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through geographic and tenant diversity. No single neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for more than 0.9% of the Company's total shopping center GLA or more than 1.0% of total annualized base rental revenues as of December 31, 2008. The Companys five largest tenants at December 31, 2008, were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohls and Wal-Mart, which represent approximately 3.3%, 2.8%, 2.5%, 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively, of the Companys annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. The Company maintains an active leasing and capital improvement program that, combined with the high quality of the locations, has made, in management's opinion, the Company's properties attractive to tenants. The Company's management believes its experience in the real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of property owners. Retail Store Leases In addition to neighborhood and community shopping centers, as of December 31, 2008, the Company had interests in retail store leases totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet of anchor stores in 16 neighborhood and community shopping centers located in 11 states. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 95.9% of the space in these anchor stores had been sublet to retailers that lease the stores under net lease agreements providing for average annualized base rental payments of $4.12 per square foot. The average annualized base rental payments under the Companys retail store leases to the landowners of such subleased stores are approximately $2.13 per square foot. The average remaining primary term of the retail store leases (and, similarly, the remaining primary term of the sublease agreements with the tenants currently leasing such space) is approximately four years, excluding options to renew the leases for terms which generally range f rom five years to 20 years. The Companys investment in retail store leases is included in the caption Other real estate investments in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. 17 Ground-Leased Properties The Company has interests in 48 consolidated shopping center properties and interests in 26 shopping center properties in unconsolidated joint ventures that are subject to long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the Company (or an affiliated joint venture) to construct and/or operate a shopping center. The Company or the joint venture pays rent for the use of the land and generally is responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the building and improvements. At the end of these long-term leases, unless extended, the land together with all improvements revert to the landowner. Ground-Up Development Properties The Company is engaged in ground-up development projects, which consist of (i) merchant building through the Companys wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries, which develop neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) U.S. ground-up development projects which will be held as long-term investments by the Company and (iii) various ground-up development projects located in Latin America for long-term investment (see Recent Developments - International Real Estate Investments and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K). The ground-up development projects generally have significant pre-leasing prior to the commencement of the construction. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had in progress a total of 47 ground-up development projects, consisting of 11 merchant building projects, of which seven are anticipated to be substantially complete during the first half of 2009, one U.S. ground-up development project, 29 ground-up development projects located throughout Mexico, three ground-up development projects located in Chile, two ground-up development projects located in Brazil and one ground-up development project located in Peru. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had in progress 11 merchant building projects located in six states, which are expected to be sold upon completion. These projects had significant pre-leasing prior to the commencement of construction. As of December 31, 2008, the average annual base rent per leased square foot for the merchant building portfolio was $14.87 and the average annual base rent per leased square foot for new leases executed in 2008 was $17.58. Undeveloped Land The Company owns certain unimproved land tracts and parcels of land adjacent to certain of its existing shopping centers that are held for possible expansion. At times, should circumstances warrant, the Company may develop or dispose of these parcels. The table on pages 19 through 40 sets forth more specific information with respect to each of the Company's property interests. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is not presently involved in any litigation nor, to its knowledge, is any litigation threatened against the Company or its subsidiaries that, in management's opinion, would result in any material adverse effect on the Company's ownership, management or operation of its properties taken as a whole, or which is not covered by the Company's liability insurance.

Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information The following sets forth the common stock offerings completed by the Company during the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. The Companys common stock (Common Stock) was sold for cash at the following offering price per share: Offering Date Offering Price March 2006 $40.80 September 2008 $37.10 In connection with the March 2006 Atlantic Realty Trust ("Atlantic Realty") merger, the Company issued Atlantic Realty shareholders 1,274,420 shares of Common Stock, excluding 201,930 shares of Common Stock that were to be received by the Company and 546,580 shares of Common Stock that were to be received by the Companys wholly owned TRS. During December 2008, the Company purchased the 546,580 shares from its TRS for a purchase price of $17.69 per share. The 546,580 shares had a carry-over basis from the Atlantic Realty share price of $17.10 per share. This purchase was not in connection with a publicly announced plan or program. The table below sets forth, for the quarterly periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share reported on the NYSE Composite Tape and declared dividends per share for the Companys common stock. The Companys common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "KIM". Stock Price Period High Low Dividends 2007: First Quarter $53.60 $43.59 $0.36 Second Quarter $50.36 $36.92 $0.36 Third Quarter $47.58 $33.74 $0.40 Fourth Quarter $47.69 $34.74 $0.40 (a) 2008: First Quarter $40.18 $29.00 $0.40 Second Quarter $42.30 $34.20 $0.40 Third Quarter $47.80 $29.54 $0.44 Fourth Quarter $37.06 $9.56 $0.44 (b) (a) Paid on January 15, 2008, to stockholders of record on January 2, 2008. (b) Paid on January 15, 2009, to stockholders of record on January 2, 2009. Holders The number of holders of record of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, was 3,492 as of January 30, 2009. Dividends Since the IPO, the Company has paid regular quarterly dividends to its stockholders. While the Company intends to continue paying regular quarterly dividends, future dividend declarations will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the actual cash flow of the Company, its financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Companys Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the Companys dividend policy on a quarterly basis as they monitor sources of capital and evaluate the impact of the economy on operating fundamentals. The Company is required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income. The actual cash flow available to pay dividends will be affected by a number of factors, including the revenues received from rental proper ties, the operating expenses of the Company, the interest expense on its borrowings, the ability of lessees to meet their obligations to the Company, the ability to refinance near-term debt maturities and any unanticipated capital expenditures. The Company has determined that the $1.64 dividend per common share paid during 2008 represented 69% ordinary income, 19% in capital gains and a 12% return of capital to its stockholders. The $1.48 dividend per common share paid during 2007 represented 56% ordinary income, 35% in capital gains and a 9% return of capital to its stockholders. 42 In addition to its Common Stock offerings, the Company has capitalized the growth in its business through the issuance of unsecured fixed and floating-rate medium-term notes, underwritten bonds, mortgage debt and construction loans, convertible preferred stock and perpetual preferred stock. Borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities have also been an interim source of funds to both finance the purchase of properties and other investments and meet any short-term working capital requirements. The various instruments governing the Company's issuance of its unsecured public debt, bank debt, mortgage debt and preferred stock impose certain restrictions on the Company with regard to dividends, voting, liquidation and other preferential rights available to the holders of such instruments. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Notes 11 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The Company does not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of its Class F Preferred Stock and Class G Preferred Stock, the financial covenants contained in its public bond indentures, as amended, or its revolving credit agreements will have an adverse impact on the Company's ability to pay dividends in the normal course to its common stockholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain its qualification as a REIT. The Company maintains a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which common and preferred stockholders and other interested investors may elect to automatically reinvest their dividends to purchase shares of the Companys common stock or, through optional cash payments, purchase shares of the Companys common stock. The Company may, from time-to-time, either (i) purchase shares of its common stock in the open market or (ii) issue new shares of its common stock for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations under the Plan. Total Stockholder Return Performance The following performance chart compares, over the five years ended December 31, 2008, the cumulative total stockholder return on the Companys common stock with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and the cumulative total return of the NAREIT Equity REIT Total Return Index (the "NAREIT Equity Index") prepared and published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). Equity real estate investment trusts are defined as those which derive more than 75% of their income from equity investments in real estate assets. The NAREIT Equity Index includes all tax qualified equity real estate investment trusts listed on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System. Stockholder return performance, presented quarterly for the five years ended December 31, 2008, is not necessarily indicative of future results. All stockholder return performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. The information in this paragraph and the following performance chart are deemed to be furnished, not filed. Item 6. Selected Financial Data The following table sets forth selected, historical, consolidated financial data for the Company and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and Notes thereto and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The Company believes that the book value of its real estate assets, which reflects the historical costs of such real estate assets less accumulated depreciation, is not indicative of the current market value of its properties. Historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating performance. 43 Year ended December 31, (2) (8) 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands, except per share information) Operating Data: Revenues from rental property (1) $ 758,704 $ 674,534 $ 580,551 $ 494,467 $ 482,248 Interest expense (3) $ 212,591 $ 213,086 $ 170,079 $ 125,825 $ 105,411 Depreciation and amortization (3) $ 204,310 $ 188,063 $ 137,820 $ 99,072 $ 93,684 Gain on sale of development properties (4) $ 36,565 $ 40,099 $ 37,276 $ 33,636 $ 16,835 Gain on transfer/sale of operating properties, net (3) $ 1,782 $ 2,708 $ 2,460 $ 2,833 $ - Benefit for income taxes (5) $ 12,974 $ 30,346 $ - $ - $ - Provision for income taxes (6) $ - $ - $ 17,253 $ 10,989 $ 8,320 Impairment Charges (4) $ 145,918 $ 13,796 $ - $ - $ - Income from continuing operations (7) $ 225,186 $ 358,991 $ 342,790 $ 321,646 $ 270,692 Income per common share, from continuing operations: Basic $ 0.69 $ 1.35 $ 1.38 $ 1.37 $ 1.16 Diluted $ 0.69 $ 1.32 $ 1.35 $ 1.34 $ 1.14 Weighted average number of shares of common stock: Basic 257,811 252,129 239,552 226,641 222,859 Diluted 258,843 257,058 244,615 230,868 227,143 Cash dividends declared per common share $ 1.68 $ 1.52 $ 1.38 $ 1.27 $ 1.16 December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Balance Sheet Data: Real estate, before accumulated depreciation $ 7,818,916 $ 7,325,035 $ 6,001,319 $ 4,560,406 $ 4,092,222 Total assets $ 9,397,147 $ 9,097,816 $ 7,869,280 $ 5,534,636 $ 4,749,597 Total debt $ 4,556,646 $ 4,216,415 $ 3,587,243 $ 2,691,196 $ 2,118,622 Total stockholders' equity $ 3,975,346 $ 3,894,574 $ 3,366,959 $ 2,387,214 $ 2,236,400 Cash flow provided by operations $ 567,599 $ 665,989 $ 455,569 $ 410,797 $ 365,176 Cash flow used for investing activities $ (781,350) $ (1,507,611) $ (246,221) $ (716,015) $ (299,597) Cash flow provided by (used for) financing activities $ 262,429 $ 584,056 $ 59,444 $ 343,271 $ (75,647) (1) Does not include (i) revenues from rental property relating to unconsolidated joint ventures, (ii) revenues relating to the investment in retail stores leases and (iii) revenues from properties included in discontinued operations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including trends which might appear, should not be taken as indicative of future operations. Executive Summary Kimco Realty Corporation is one of the nations largest publicly-traded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had interests in 1,950 properties, totaling approximately 182.2 million square feet of GLA located in 45 states, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Peru. The Company is self-administered and self-managed through present management, which has owned and managed neighborhood and community shopping centers for over 50 years. The executive officers are engaged in the day-to-day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the Company, with nearly all operating functions, including leasing, asset management, maintenance, construction, legal, finance and accounting, administered by the Company. In connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 (the "RMA"), which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code, subject to certain limitations. As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various retail real estate-related opportunities including (i) merchant building, through its wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are primarily engaged in the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition services, which primarily focus on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and dist ressed and/or bankrupt retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions. The Company will consider other investments through taxable REIT subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise. In addition, the Company continues to capitalize on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management, leasing and operational support for those properties. The Company also provides preferred equity capital for real estate entrepreneurs and provides real estate capital and advisory services to both healthy and distressed retailers. The Company has made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment was, in managements judgment, priced below the value of the underlying assets. However, these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets. The Companys strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet providing it the necessary flexibility to invest opportunistically and selectively, primarily focusing on neighborhood and community shopping centers. The Company continually evaluates its debt maturities, and, based on managements current assessment, believes it has viable financing and refinancing alternatives that will not materially adversely impact its expected financial results. Although the credit environment has become much more constrained since the third quarter of 2008, the Company continues to pursue opportunities with large commercial U.S. and global banks, select life insurance companies and certain regional and local banks. The Company has noticed a trend that the approval process from lenders has slowed, while pricing and loan-to-value ratios remain dependent on specific deal terms, in general, spreads are higher and loan-to-values are lower, but the lenders are continuing to complete financing agreements. Moreover, the Company continues to assess 2009 and beyond to ensure the Company is prepared if the current credit market dislocation continues. The retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions. These conditions have forced some weaker retailers, in some cases, to declare bankruptcy and/or close stores. Certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection. However, any of these particular store closings affecting the Company often represent a small percentage of the Companys overall gross leasable area and the Company does not currently expect store closings to have a material adverse effect on the Companys overall performance. The decline in market conditions has also had a negative effect on real estate transactional activity as it relates to the acquisition and sale of real estate assets. The Company believes that the lack of real estate transactions will continue throughout 2009 which will curtail the Companys growth in the near term. 45 Critical Accounting Policies The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest, including where the Company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of Interpretation No. 46 (R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, or meets certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04-5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership when the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners have Certain Rights ("EITF 04-5"). The Company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost, equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting p rinciples generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives, valuation of real estate and intangible assets and liabilities, valuation of joint venture investments, marketable securities and other investments and realizability of deferred tax assets. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, act ual results could materially differ from these estimates. The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures, marketable securities and other investments. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of impairments and/or valuation allowances. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. Real Estate The Companys investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized. Upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (primarily consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (primarily consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships), assumed debt and redeemable units issued in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business Combinations. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. The Company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: Buildings and building improvements 15 to 50 years Fixtures, leasehold and tenant improvements Terms of leases or useful (including certain identified intangible assets) lives, whichever is shorter The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. These assessments have a direct impact on the Companys net income. Real estate under development on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets represents ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion and projects which the Company may hold as long-term investments. These assets are carried at cost. The cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically 46 identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. If, in managements opinion, the estimated net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. A gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Real Estate Sales. On a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. A property value is considered impaired only if managements estimate of current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property. Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. When a real estate asset is identified by management as held-for-sale, the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs. If, in managements opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the Company exercises significant influence, but does not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions. Earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and, where applicable, are based upon an allocation of the investments net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period. The Companys joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co-investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties, consistent with its core business. These joint ventures typically obtain non-recourse third-party financing on their property investments, thus contractually limiting the Companys exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment, and, due to the lenders exposure to losses, a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk. The Companys exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments. The Company, on a selective basis, obtains unsecured financing for certain joint ventures. These unsecured financings are guaranteed by the Company with guarantees from the joint venture partners for their proportionate amount s of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. On a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the Companys investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. An investments value is impaired only if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. The Companys estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each specific property that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. Capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon rates that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for each respective property. Marketable Securities The Company classifies its existing marketable equity securities as available-for-sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. These securities are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. All debt securities are generally classified as held-to-maturity because the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Debt securities which contain conversion features are generally classified as available-for-sale. On a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Companys marketable securities may be impaired. A marketable security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than the carrying value of the security and such difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the security over the estimated fair value in the security. 47 Results of Operations Comparison 2008 to 2007 2008 2007 Increase/ (Decrease) % change (all amounts in millions) Revenues from rental property (1) $ 758.7 $ 674.5 $ 84.2 12.5% Rental property expenses: (2) Rent $ 13.4 $ 12.1 $ 1.3 10.7% Real estate taxes 98.0 82.5 15.5 18.8% Operating and maintenance 104.7 89.1 15.6 17.5% $ 216.1 $ 183.7 $ 32.4 17.6% Depreciation and amortization (3) $ 204.3 $ 188.1 $ 16.2 8.6% (1) Revenues from rental property increased primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of operating properties during 2008 and 2007, providing incremental revenues of approximately $54.2 million,(ii) the completion of certain development and redevelopment projects and tenant buyouts providing incremental revenues of approximately $34.1 million for the year ended 2008 as compared to the corresponding period in 2007, partially offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period in 2007, primarily resulting from the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities and the sale of certain properties during 2008 and 2007 and (iv)an overall occupancy decrease from the consolidated shopping center portfolio from 95.9% at December 31, 2007 to 93.2% at December 31, 2008. (2) Rental property expenses increased primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2008 and 2007 which were partially offset by operating property dispositions including those transferred to various joint venture entities. (3) Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2008 and 2007 which were partially offset by operating property dispositions including those transferred to various joint venture entities. Mortgage and other financing income increased $4.1 million to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $14.2 million for the corresponding period in 2007. This increase is primarily due to an increase in interest income from new mortgage receivables entered into during 2008 and 2007. Management and other fee income decreased approximately $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period in 2007. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in other transaction related fees of approximately $9.1 million, recognized during the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by an increase in property management fees of approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period in 2007. This increase is primarily due to personnel-related costs, primarily due to the growth within the Companys co-investment programs and the overall continued growth of the Company during 2008 and 2007. In addition, due to current economic conditions resulting in the lack of transactional activity within the real estate industry as a whole, the Company has accrued approximately $3.6 million at December 31, 2008, relating to severance costs associated with employees who have been terminated during January 2009. Interest, dividends and other investment income increased approximately $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period in 2007. This increase is primarily due to (i) an increase in realized gains of approximately $2.5 million resulting from the sale of certain marketable securities during 2008 as compared to the corresponding period in 2007, (ii) an increase in interest income of approximately $16.1 million, primarily resulting from interest earned on notes acquired in 2008 and (iii) an increase in dividend income of approximately $1.2 million primarily resulting from increased investments in marketable securities during 2008. Other expense, net decreased approximately $8.3 million to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $10.6 million for the corresponding period in 2007. This decrease is primarily due to (i) a reduction in Canadian withholding tax expense relating to a 2007 capital transaction from a Canadian preferred equity investment, partially offset by (ii) the receipt of fewer shares during 2008 as compared to 2007 of Sears Holding Corp. common stock received as partial settlement of Kmart pre-petition claims and (iii) the recognition of a $7.7 million unrealized decrease in the fair value of an embedded derivative instrument relating to the convertible option of certain debt securities. 48 (Provision)/benefit for income taxes changed $45.9 million to a provision of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to a benefit of $42.4 million for the corresponding period in 2007. This change is primarily due to (i) a tax provision of approximately $17.3 million, partially offset by a reduction of approximately $3.1 million in NOL valuation allowance from equity income recognized during 2008 in connection with the Albertsons investment and (ii) a reduction of approximately $28.1 million of NOL valuation allowance during 2007. Income from other real estate investments increased $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period in 2007. This increase is primarily due to a gain of approximately $7.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, from the sale of the Companys interest in a real estate company located in Mexico. Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net for the year ended December 31, 2008, was approximately $132.2 million as compared to $173.4 million for the corresponding period in 2007. This reduction of approximately $41.2 million is primarily the result of (i) a decrease in equity in income of approximately $47.1 million from the Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio (KROP) joint venture investment primarily due to a decrease in profit participation from the sale/transfer of operating properties for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period in 2007, (ii) a decrease in equity in income of approximately $25.2 million from the KIR joint venture investment primarily resulting from fewer gains on sales of operating properties during the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period in 2007, (iii) impairment charges during 2008 of approximately $11.2 million, before income tax benefit, relating to certain joint vent ure properties held by the KimPru joint venture that are deemed held-for-sale or were transitioned to held-for-use properties,(iv) lower gains on sale of approximately $21.3 million for 2008 as compared to 2007, partially offset by (v) an increase in equity in income of approximately $67.4 million from the Albertsons joint venture investment primarily resulting from gains on sale of 121 properties during 2008 as compared to 2007 and (vi) growth within the Companys other various real estate joint ventures due to additional capital investments for the acquisition of additional operating properties by ventures throughout 2007 and the year ended December 31, 2008. During 2008, the Company sold, in separate transactions, (i) two completed merchant building projects, (ii) 21 out-parcels, (iii) a partial sale of one project and (iv) a partnership interest in one project for aggregate proceeds of approximately $73.5 million and received approximately $4.1 million of proceeds from completed earn-out requirements on three previously sold merchant building projects. These sales resulted in gains of approximately $21.9 million, after income taxes of $14.6 million. During 2007, the Company sold, in separate transactions, (i) four completed merchant building projects, (ii) 26 out-parcels, (iii) 74.3 acres of undeveloped land and (iv) completed partial sales of two projects, for aggregate total proceeds of approximately $310.5 million and approximately $3.3 million of proceeds from completed earn-out requirements on previously sold projects. These transactions resulted in gains of approximately $24.1 million, after income taxes of $16.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of approximately $114.8 million, net of income tax benefit of approximately $31.1 million, of which approximately $105.1 million of these charges where taken in the fourth quarter of 2008. Approximately $92.7 million of the total non-cash impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2008, were due to the decline in value of certain marketable equity securities and other investments that were deemed to be other-than-temporary. Of the $92.7 million, approximately $83.1 million of these impairment charges were taken at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008 resulting from the unprecedented deterioration of the equity markets during the fourth quarter and the uncertainty of their future recoverability. The Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $15.5 million against the carrying value of its investment in its unconsolidated joint ventures with PREI, reflecting an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of its investment resulting from further significant declines in the real estate markets during the fourth quarter of 2008. Also, impairments of approximately $6.6 million were recognized on real estate development projects including Plantations Crossing located in Middleburg, FL and Miramar Town Center located in Miramar, FL. These development project impairment charges are the result of adverse changes in local market conditions and the uncertainty of their recovery in the future. The Company will continue to assess the value of all its assets on an on-going basis. Based on these assessments, the Company may determine that a decline in value for one or more of its investments may be other-than-temporary or permanent and would therefore write-down its cost basis accordingly. During 2008, the Company disposed of seven operating properties and a portion of four operating properties, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of approximately $73.0 million, which resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately $20.0 million. In addition, the Company partially recognized deferred gains of approximately $1.2 million on three properties relating to their transfer and partial sale in connection with the Kimco Income Fund II transaction described below. 49 During 2007 the Company transferred 11 operating properties to a wholly-owned consolidated entity, Kimco Income Fund II (KIF II), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $278.2 million, including non-recourse mortgage debt of $180.9 million, encumbering 11 of the properties. During 2008, the Company transferred an additional three properties for $73.9 million, including $50.6 million in non-recourse mortgage debt. During 2008 the Company sold a 26.4% non-controlling ownership interest in the entity to third parties for approximately $32.5 million, which approximated the Companys cost. The Company continues to consolidate this entity. Additionally, during 2008, the Company disposed of an operating property for approximately $21.4 million. The Company provided seller financing for approximately $3.6 million, which bears interest at 10% per annum and is scheduled to mature on May 1, 2011. Due to the terms of this financing the Company has deferred its gain of $3.7 million from this sale. Additionally, during 2008, a consolidated joint venture in which the Company had a preferred equity investment disposed of a property for a sales price of approximately $35.0 million. As a result of this capital transaction, the Company received approximately $3.5 million of profit participation, before minority interest of approximately $1.1 million. This profit participation has been recorded as income from other real estate investments and is reflected in Income from discontinued operating properties in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2007, the Company (i) disposed of six operating properties and completed partial sales of three operating properties, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of approximately $40.0 million, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of approximately $6.4 million, after income taxes of approximately $1.6 million and (ii) transferred one operating property, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2007, to a joint venture in which the Company holds a 15% non-controlling ownership interest for an aggregate price of approximately $4.5 million, which represented the net book value. Additionally, during 2007, two consolidated joint ventures in which the Company had preferred equity investments disposed of, in separate transactions, their respective properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $66.5 million. As a result of these capital transactions, the Company received approximately $22.1 million of profit participation, before minority interest of approximately $5.6 million. This profit participation has been recorded as income from other real estate investments and is reflected in Income from discontinued operating properties in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008, was $249.9 million or $0.78 on a diluted per share basis as compared to $442.8 million or $1.65 on a diluted per share basis for the corresponding period in 2007. This change is primarily attributable to (i) the recognition of non-cash impairment charges aggregating approximately $121.5 million, net of income tax benefit, resulting from continuing declines in the equity securities and real estate markets, (ii) recognition of an extraordinary gain of approximately $50.3 million, net of income tax, in 2007, relating to the Albertsons joint venture, (iii) a reduction of Equity in income of real estate joint ventures of approximately $41.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in profit participation and gain on sales of operating properties during 2008 as compared to 2007, iv) a decrease in the reduction of NOL valuation allowance and the recording of a provision from equity in income recognized during 2008 in connection with the Albert sons investment, partially offset by (v) an increase in revenues from rental properties primarily due to acquisitions of operating properties during 2008 and 2007. Comparison 2007 to 2006 2007 2006 Increase/ (Decrease) % change (all amounts in millions) Revenues from rental property (1) $ 674.5 $ 580.6 $ 93.9 16.2% Rental property expenses: (2) Rent $ 12.1 $ 11.5 $ 0.6 5.2% Real estate taxes 82.5 73.6 8.9 12.1% Operating and maintenance 89.1 72.0 17.1 23.8% $ 183.7 $ 157.1 $ 26.6 16.9% Depreciation and amortization (3) $ 188.1 $ 137.8 $ 50.3 36.5% (1) Revenues from rental property increased primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of operating properties during 2007 and 2006, providing incremental revenues of approximately $85.5 million, (ii) an overall occupancy increase from the consolidated shopping center portfolio to 95.9% at December 31, 2007, as compared to 95.1% at December 31, 2006, due to growth in rental rates from renewing expiring leases, the completion of certain redevelopment and development projects and tenant buyouts providing incremental revenues of approximately $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006, offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006, resulting from the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities, and the sale of certain properties during 2007 and 2006. 50 (2) Rental property expenses increased primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2007 and 2006, which were partially offset by operating property dispositions including those transferred to various joint venture entities. (3) Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2007 and 2006, which were partially offset by operating property dispositions including those transferred to various joint venture entities. Mortgage and other financing income decreased $4.6 million to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $18.8 million for the corresponding period in 2006. This decrease is primarily due to the recognition of accretion income of approximately $6.2 million, resulting from the early prepayment of a mortgage receivable in 2006 partially offset by an overall increase in interest income on mortgage receivables entered into in 2007 and 2006. Management and other fee income increased approximately $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006. This increase is primarily due to increased property management fees and other transaction related fees related to the growth in the Companys co-investment programs. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006. This increase is primarily due to personnel-related costs, primarily due to growth within the Companys co-investment programs and the overall continued growth of the Company. Interest, dividends and other investment income decreased approximately $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in realized gains resulting from the sale of certain marketable securities during 2007 as compared to the corresponding period in 2006. Other (expense)/income, net decreased approximately $19.5 million to $10.6 million of an expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $8.9 million in income for the corresponding period in 2006. This decrease is primarily due to (i) the receipt of fewer shares during 2007 as compared to 2006 of Sears Holding Corp. common stock received as partial settlement of Kmart pre-petition claims and (ii) an increase in Canadian withholding charges on profit participation proceeds received during 2007 relating to capital transactions from a Canadian preferred equity investment. Interest expense increased approximately $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006. This increase is due to higher interest rates and higher outstanding levels of debt during the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006. Benefit for income taxes increased $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006. This increase is primarily due to the reduction of approximately $31.2 million of NOL valuation allowance and a tax benefit of approximately $10.1 million from operating losses recognized in connection with the Albertsons investment. Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $67.8 million to $173.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $105.5 million for the corresponding period in 2006. This increase is primarily the result of (i) an increase in equity in income from the Kimco Realty Opportunity Portfolio ("KROP") joint venture investment primarily resulting from profit participation of approximately $39.3 million and gains on sale/transfer of operating properties during 2007 of which the Companys share of gains were $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, (ii) an increase in equity in income from the Kimco Income Opportunity Portfolio ("KIR") joint venture investment primarily resulting from gains on sale of operating properties during 2007 of which the Companys share of gains was $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, and (iii) the Companys growth of its various other real estate joint ventures due to additio nal capital investments for the acquisition of additional operating properties by the ventures throughout 2007 and 2006, partially offset by net operating losses and excess cash distribution from the Albertsons joint venture of approximately $7.9 million during 2007. During 2007, the Company sold, in separate transactions, (i) four completed merchant building projects, (ii) 26 out-parcels, (iii) 74.3 acres of undeveloped land and (iv) completed partial sales of two projects, for aggregate total proceeds of approximately $310.5 million and approximately $3.3 million of proceeds from completed earn-out requirements on previously sold projects. These transactions resulted in gains of approximately $24.1 million, after income taxes of $16.0 million. As part of the Companys ongoing analysis of its merchant building projects, the Company has determined that for two of its projects, located in Jacksonville, FL and Anchorage, AK, the recoverable value will not exceed their estimated cost. This is primarily due to adverse changes in local market conditions and the uncertainty of their recovery in the future. As a result, the Company has recorded an aggregate pre-tax adjustment of property carrying value on these projects for the year ended December 31, 2007, of $8.5 million, representing the excess of the carrying value of the projects over their estimated fair value. 51 During 2006, the Company sold six recently completed merchant building projects, its partnership interest in one project and 30 out-parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $260.0 million. These sales resulted in gains of approximately $25.1 million, after income taxes of $12.2 million. These gains exclude approximately $1.1 million of gain relating to one project, which was deferred due to the Companys continued ownership interest. During 2007, the Company (i) disposed of six operating properties and completed partial sales of three operating properties, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of approximately $40.0 million, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of approximately $6.4 million, after income tax of approximately $1.6 million and (ii) transferred one operating property, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2007, to a joint venture in which the Company holds a 15% non-controlling ownership interest for an aggregate price of approximately $4.5 million, which represented the net book value. Additionally, during 2007, two consolidated joint ventures in which the Company had preferred equity investments disposed of, in separate transactions, their respective properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $66.5 million. As a result of these capital transactions, the Company received approximately $22.1 million of profit participation, before minority interest of approximately $5.6 million. This profit participation has been recorded as income from other real estate investments and is reflected in Income from discontinued operating properties in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2006, the Company disposed of (i) 28 operating properties and one ground lease for an aggregate sales price of $270.5 million, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of approximately $71.7 million, net of income taxes of $2.8 million relating to the sale of two properties, and (ii) transferred five operating properties, to joint ventures in which the Company has 20% non-controlling interests for an aggregate price of approximately $95.4 million, which resulted in a gain of approximately $1.4 million from one transferred property. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $442.8 million or $1.65 on a diluted per share basis as compared to $428.3 million or $1.70 on a diluted per share basis for the corresponding period in 2006. This change is primarily attributable to (i) an increase in revenues from rental properties primarily due to acquisitions of operating properties during 2007 and 2006, (ii) an increase in equity in income of real estate joint ventures achieved from profit participation and gains on sale of joint venture operating properties and additional capital investments in the Companys joint venture programs for the acquisition of additional operating properties throughout 2007 and 2006, (iii) earnings of $75.5 million related to the Albertsons investment monetization, partially offset by (iv) a decrease in income resulting from the sale of certain marketable securities during the corresponding period in 2006 and (v) a decrease in gains on sale of operating properties in 20 07 as compared to 2006. Tenant Concentrations The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single property and a large tenant base. At December 31, 2008, the Companys five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohls and Wal-Mart, which represented approximately 3.3%, 2.8%, 2.5%, 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively, of the Companys annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys capital resources include accessing the public debt and equity capital markets, when available, mortgage and construction loan financing and immediate access to unsecured revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of approximately $1.7 billion. The Companys cash flow activities are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net cash flow provided by operating activities $ 567.6 $ 666.0 $ 455.6 Net cash flow used for investing activities $(781.4) $(1,507.6) $ (246.2) Net cash flow provided by financing activities $ 262.4 $ 584.1 $ 59.4 Operating Activities Cash flows provided from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008, were approximately $567.6 million, as compared to approximately $666.0 million for the comparable period in 2007. The change of approximately $98.4 million is primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in distributions from joint ventures resulting from a decrease of approximately $66.2 million in distributions from the Albertsons investment during 2008 as compared to 2007 and a decrease of approximately $74.8 million in 52 distributions from other joint venture investments, primarily from the KROP joint venture investment, which was due to a decrease in profit participation from the sale/transfer of operating properties for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period in 2007, partially offset by increased cash flows due to (ii) the acquisition of properties during 2008 and 2007 and (iii) growth in rental rates from lease renewals and the completion of certain re-development and development projects. Recently, the capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile and constrained as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies. If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and the availability of funds remains limited, the Company will incur increased costs associated with issuing or obtaining debt. In addition, it is possible that the Companys ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited by these or other factors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at this time the Company anticipates that cash flows from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations and dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short term and long term. The Company continually evaluates its debt maturities, and, based on managements current assessment, believes it has viable financing and refinancing alternatives that will not materially adversely impact its expected financial results. Although the credit environment has become much more constrained since the third quarter of 2008, the Company continues to pursue opportunities with large commercial U.S. and global banks, select life insurance companies and certain regional and local banks. The Company has noticed a trend that the approval process from lenders has slowed, while pricing and loan-to-value ratios remain dependent on specific deal terms, in general, spreads are higher and loan-to-values are lower, but the lenders are continuing to complete financing agreements. Moreover, the Company continues to assess 2009 and beyond to ensure the Company is prepared if the current credit market dislocation continues. Debt maturities for 2009 consist of: $451.9 million of consolidated debt; $756.1 million of unconsolidated joint venture debt; and $245.0 million of preferred equity debt, assuming the utilization of extension options where available. The 2009 consolidated debt maturities are anticipated to be repaid with operating cash flows, borrowings from the Companys credit facilities, which at December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately $1.0 billion available under these credit facilities, and debt refinancings. The 2009 unconsolidated joint venture and preferred equity debt maturities are anticipated to be repaid through debt refinancing and partner capital contributions, as deemed appropriate. The Company anticipates that cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, issuance of equity and public debt, as well as other debt and equity alternatives, will provide the necessary capital required by the Company. Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008, was primarily attributable to (i) cash flow from the diverse portfolio of rental properties, (ii) the acquisition of operating properties during 2008 and 2007, (iii) new leasing, expansion and re-tenanting of core portfolio properties and (iv) contributions from the Companys joint venture and Preferred Equity programs. Investing Activities Cash flows used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008, were approximately $781.4 million, as compared to approximately $1.5 billion for the comparable period in 2007. This decrease in cash utilization of approximately $726.3 million resulted primarily from decreases in (i) the acquisition of and improvements to operating real estate, (ii) the acquisition of and improvements to real estate under development and (iii) the Companys investment and advances to joint ventures, partially offset by (iv) an increase in cash utilized for investments in marketable securities including the acquisition of the Valad convertible notes and equity securities during 2008 and (v) a decrease in proceeds from the sale of development properties during the 2008 as compared to the corresponding period in 2007. Acquisitions of and Improvements to Operating Real Estate During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company expended approximately $266.2 million towards acquisition of and improvements to operating real estate including $68.9 million expended in connection with redevelopments and re-tenanting projects as described below. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) The Company has an ongoing program to reformat and re-tenant its properties to maintain or enhance its competitive position in the marketplace. The Company anticipates its capital commitment toward these and other redevelopment projects during 2009 will be approximately $50.0 million to $80.0 million. The funding of these capital requirements will be provided by cash flow from operating activities and availability under the Companys revolving lines of credit. Investments and Advances to Real Estate Joint Ventures During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company expended approximately $219.9 million for investments and advances to real estate joint ventures and received approximately $118.7 million from reimbursements of advances to real estate joint ventures. (See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) 53 Acquisitions of and Improvements to Real Estate Under Development The Company is engaged in ground-up development projects which consist of (i) merchant building through the Companys wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries, which develop neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) U.S. ground-up development projects which will be held as long-term investments by the Company and (iii) various ground-up development projects located in Latin America for long-term investment (see Recent Developments - International Real Estate Investments and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K). The ground-up development projects generally have significant pre-leasing prior to the commencement of construction. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had in progress a total of 47 ground-up development projects including 11 merchant building projects, one U.S. ground-up development project, 29 ground-up development projects located throughout Mexic o, three ground-up development projects located in Chile, two ground-up development projects located in Brazil and one ground-up development project located in Peru. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company expended approximately $389.0 million in connection with construction costs and the purchase of land related to ground-up development projects. The Company anticipates its capital commitment during 2009 toward these and other development projects will be approximately $150.0 million to $200.0 million. The proceeds from the sales of completed ground-up development projects, proceeds from construction loans and availability under the Companys revolving lines of credit are expected to be sufficient to fund these anticipated capital requirements. Dispositions and Transfers During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $176.3 million relating to the sale of various operating properties and ground-up development projects and approximately $32.4 million from the transfer of operating properties to various joint ventures. (See Notes 3 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) Financing Activities Cash flows provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008, were approximately $262.4 million, as compared to approximately $584.1 million for the comparable period in 2007. This decrease of approximately $321.7 million resulted primarily from the (i) decrease in proceeds provided by mortgage/construction loan financing of approximately $337.5 million, (ii) a decrease of $300.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of unsecured senior notes and (iii) the increase in dividends paid during 2008 as compared to the corresponding period in 2007, offset by (iv) an increase in borrowings under the Companys unsecured revolving credit facilities of approximately $185.0 million and (v) a decrease in repayment of unsecured senior notes and repayments of borrowings under unsecured revolving credit facilities of approximately $187.5 million. The Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintaining its investment-grade debt ratings. The Company may, from time-to-time, seek to obtain funds through additional common and preferred equity offerings, unsecured debt financings and/or mortgage/construction loan financings and other capital alternatives in a manner consistent with its intention to operate with a conservative debt structure. Since the completion of the Companys IPO in 1991, the Company has utilized the public debt and equity markets as its principal source of capital for its expansion needs. Since the IPO, the Company has completed additional offerings of its public unsecured debt and equity, raising in the aggregate over $6.1 billion. Proceeds from public capital market activities have been used for the purposes of, among other things, repaying indebtedness, acquiring interests in neighborhood and community shopping centers, funding ground-up development projects, expanding and improving properties in the portfolio and other investments. These markets have experienced extreme volatility and deterioration since the third quarter 2008. As available, the Company will continue to access these markets. In March 2006, the Company was added to the S & P 500 Index, an index containing the stock of 500 Large Cap corporations, most of which are U.S. corporations. The Company has a $1.5 billion unsecured U.S. revolving credit facility (the "U.S. Credit Facility") with a group of banks, which is scheduled to expire in October 2011. The Company has a one-year extension option related to this facility. This credit facility has made available funds to finance general corporate purposes, including (i) property acquisitions, (ii) investments in the Companys institutional management programs, (iii) development and redevelopment costs and (iv) any short-term working capital requirements, including managing the Companys debt maturities. Interest on borrowings under the U.S. Credit Facility accrues at LIBOR plus 54 0.425% and fluctuates in accordance with changes in the Companys senior debt ratings. As part of this U.S. Credit Facility, the Company has a competitive bid option whereby the Company may auction up to $750.0 million of its requested borrowings to the bank group. This competitive bid option provides the Company the opportunity to obtain pricing below the currently stated spread. A facility fee of 0.15% per annum is payable quarterly in arrears. As part of the U.S. Credit Facility, the Company has a $200.0 million sub-limit which provides it the opportunity to borrow in alternative currencies such as Pounds Sterling, Japanese Yen or Euros. As of December 31, 2008, there was $675.0 million outstanding and $23.5 million in letter of credit appropriations under this credit facility. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. Credit Facility, the Company, among other things, is subject to maintenance of various covenants. The Company is currently not in violation of these covenants. Financial covenants for the U.S. Credit Facility are as follows: Covenant Must Be As of 12/31/08 Total Indebtedness to Gross Asset Value (GAV) <60% 47% Total Priority Indebtedness to GAV <35% 11% Unencumbered Asset Net Operating Income to Total Unsecured Interest Expense >1.75x 2.77x Fixed Charge Total Adjusted EBITDA to Total Debt Service >1.50x 2.57x Limitation of Investments, Loans and Advances <30% of GAV 18% of GAV For a full description of the US Credit Facilitys covenants refer to the Credit Agreement dated as of October 25, 2007 filed in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 25, 2007. The Company also has a three-year CAD $250.0 million unsecured credit facility with a group of banks. This facility bore interest at the CDOR Rate, as defined, plus 0.45%, and was scheduled to expire in March 2008. During October 2007, the facility was amended to modify the covenant package to conform to the Companys U.S. Credit Facility. The facility was further amended in January 2008, to extend the maturity date to 2011, with an additional one-year extension option, at a reduced rate of CDOR plus 0.425%, subject to change in accordance with the Companys senior debt ratings. This facility also permits U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. Proceeds from this facility are used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of Canadian denominated investments. As of December 31, 2008, there was CAD $40.0 million (approximately USD $32.7 million) outstanding balance under this credit facility. The Canadian facility covenants are t he same as the U.S. Credit Facility covenants described above. Additionally, the Company had a three-year MXP 500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility which bore interest at the TIIE Rate, as defined therein, plus 1.00%, subject to change in accordance with the Companys senior debt ratings, and was scheduled to mature in May 2008. During March 2008, the Company obtained a MXP 1.0 billion term loan, which bears interest at a rate of 8.58%, subject to change in accordance with the Companys senior debt ratings, and is scheduled to mature in March 2013. The Company utilized proceeds from this term loan to fully repay the outstanding balance of the MXP 500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which has been terminated. Remaining proceeds from this term loan were used for funding MXP denominated investments. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance on this term loan was MXP 1.0 billion (approximately USD $73.9 million). The Mexican term loan covenants are the same as the U.S. and Canadian Cre dit Facilities covenants described above. The Company has a Medium Term Notes ("MTN") program pursuant to which it may, from time-to-time, offer for sale its senior unsecured debt for any general corporate purposes, including (i) funding specific liquidity requirements in its business, including property acquisitions, development and redevelopment costs and (ii) managing the Companys debt maturities. (See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) The Companys supplemental indenture governing its medium term notes and senior notes contains the following covenants, all of which the Company is compliant with: Covenant Must Be As of 12/31/08 Consolidated Indebtedness to Total Assets <60% 49% Consolidated Secured Indebtedness to Total Assets <40% 11% Consolidated Income Available for Debt Service to maximum Annual Service Charge >1.50x 2.9x Unencumbered Total Asset Value to Consolidated Unsecured Indebtedness >1.50x 2.1x For a full description of the Indentures covenants refer to the Indenture dated September 1, 1993, First Supplemental Indenture dated August 4, 1994, the Second Supplemental Indenture dated April 7, 1995, and the Third Supplemental Indenture dated June 2, 2006, as filed with the SEC. See Exhibits Index on page 67, for specific filing information. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company repaid its $100.0 million 3.95% medium term notes, which matured on August 5, 2008, and its $25.0 million 7.2% senior notes, which matured on September 15, 2008. In addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the Company may, from time-to-time, obtain mortgage financing on selected properties and construction loans to partially fund the capital needs of its ground-up development projects. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had over 390 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio. 55 During 2008, the Company (i) obtained an aggregate of approximately $16.7 million of non-recourse mortgage debt on three operating properties, (ii) assumed approximately $101.1 million of individual non-recourse mortgage debt relating to the acquisition of five operating properties, including approximately $0.8 million of fair value debt adjustments and (iii) paid off approximately $73.4 million of individual non-recourse mortgage debt that encumbered 11 operating properties. During 2008, the Company obtained individual construction loans on three merchant building projects. Additionally, the Company repaid a construction loan on one merchant building project. At December 31, 2008, total loan commitments on the Companys 16 outstanding construction loans aggregated approximately $364.2 million of which approximately $268.3 million has been funded. These loans have scheduled maturities ranging from two months to 42 months and bear interest at rates ranging from 1.81% to 3.19% at December 31, 2008. Approximately $194.0 million of the outstanding loan balance matures in 2009. These maturing loans are anticipated to be repaid with operating cash flows, borrowings under the Companys credit facilities and additional debt financings. In addition, the Company may pursue or exercise existing extension options with lenders where available. During May 2006, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR, which is effective for a term of three-years, for unlimited future offerings, from time-to-time, of debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock and common stock warrants. During September 2008, the Company completed a primary public stock offering of 11,500,000 shares of the Companys common stock. The net proceeds from this sale of common stock, totaling approximately $409.4 million (after related transaction costs of $0.6 million) were used to partially repay the outstanding balance under the Companys U.S. revolving credit facility. During 2008, the Company received approximately $38.3 million through employee stock option exercises and the dividend reinvestment program. In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows. The Companys Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the Companys dividend policy on a quarterly basis as they monitor sources of capital and evaluate the impact of the economy and capital markets availability on operating fundamentals. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid increased to $4 69.0 million in 2008, compared to $384.5 million in 2007 and $332.6 million in 2006. Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments. The Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per common share payable to shareholders of record on January 2, 2009, which was paid on January 15, 2009. In addition, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per common share payable April 15, 2009 to shareholders of record on April 6, 2009. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments The Company has debt obligations relating to its revolving credit facilities, MTNs, senior notes, mortgages and construction loans with maturities ranging from less than one year to 27 years. As of December 31, 2008, the Companys total debt had a weighted average term to maturity of approximately 4.5 years. In addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has 48 shopping center properties that are subject to long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the Company to construct and/or operate a shopping center. In addition, the Company has 16 non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its retail store lease portfolio. The following table summarizes the Companys debt maturities, excluding extension options, and obligations under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Long-Term Debt-Principal (1) $566.7 $346.5 $1,112.8 $293.8 $599.7 $ 1,619.6 $4,539.1 Long-Term Debt- Interest(2) $200.0 $183.4 $157.5 $141.2 $107.2 $134.5 $923.8 Operating Leases Ground Leases $ 10.9 $ 8.9 $ 6.7 $ 6.0 $ 5.3 $ 108.7 $ 146.5 Retail Store Leases $ 3.7 $ 3.7 $ 3.1 $ 2.1 $ 1.3 $ 0.5 $ 14.4 56 (1) maturities utilized do not reflect extension options, which range from six months to two years. (2) for loans which have interest at floating rates, future interest expense was calculated using the rate as of December 31, 2008. The Company has $50.0 million of medium term notes, $130.0 million of senior unsecured notes, $6.1 of unsecured notes payable, $173.6 million of mortgage debt and $194.0 million of construction loans scheduled to mature in 2009. The Company anticipates satisfying these maturities with a combination of operating cash flows, its unsecured revolving credit facilities, refinancing of debt, new debt issuances, when available, and the sale of completed ground-up development projects. The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees for construction loans encumbering certain of the Companys ground-up development projects and guaranty of payment related to the Companys insurance program. These letters of credit aggregate approximately $34.3 million. During August 2008, KimPru entered into a new $650.0 million credit facility which matures in August 2009, with the option to extend for one year, and bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.25%. KimPru is obligated to pay down a minimum of $165.0 million, among other requirements, in order to exercise the one-year extension option. The required pay down is expected to be sourced from property sales, other debt financings and/or capital contributions by the partners. This facility is guaranteed by the Company with a guarantee from PREI to the Company for 85% of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. Proceeds from this new credit facility were used to repay the outstanding balance of $658.7 million under an existing $1.2 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in October 2008 and bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 0.45%. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance on the new credit facility was $650.0 million. During September 2008, a joint venture in which the Company has a non-controlling ownership interest obtained a $37.0 million mortgage loan, which is jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture partner, with a commitment of up to $37.0 million of which $26.9 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2008. This loan bears interest at 6.375% and is scheduled to mature in October 2019. During October 2008, a joint venture in which the Company has a non-controlling ownership interest entered into an extension and modification agreement for a $28.0 million term loan. The loan is guaranteed by the Company, with a commitment of up to $28.0 million of which $28.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2008. This loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.65%, which was 2.09% at December 31, 2008, and is scheduled to mature in March 2009. The Company is currently negotiating with lenders regarding extending or refinancing this debt. During June 2007, the Company entered into a joint venture, in which the Company has a non-controlling ownership interest, and acquired all of the common stock of InTown Suites Management, Inc. This investment was funded with approximately $186.0 million of new cross-collateralized non-recourse mortgage debt with a fixed interest rate of 5.59%, encumbering 35 properties, a $153.0 million three-year unsecured credit facility, with two one-year extension options, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.375% and is guaranteed by the Company and the assumption of $278.6 million cross-collateralized non-recourse mortgage debt with fixed interest rates ranging from 5.19% to 5.89%, encumbering 86 properties. The joint venture partner has pledged its equity interest for any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to pay. The outstanding balance on the three-year unsecured credit facility was $147.5 million as of December 31, 2008. The joint venture obtained an interest rate swa p at 5.37% on $128.0 million of this debt. The swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and is deemed highly effective; as such adjustments to the swaps fair value are recorded in Other comprehensive income. During November 2007, the Company entered into a joint venture, in which the Company has a non-controlling ownership interest, to acquire a property in Houston, Texas. This investment was funded with a $24.5 million unsecured credit facility scheduled to mature in November 2009, with a six-month extension option, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.375% and is guaranteed by the Company. The outstanding balance on this credit facility as of December 31, 2008, was $24.5 million. During April 2007, the Company entered into a joint venture, in which the Company has a 50% non-controlling ownership interest to acquire a property in Visalia, CA. Subsequent to this acquisition the joint venture obtained a $6.0 million three-year promissory note which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% and has an extension option of two-years. This loan is jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture partner. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance on this loan was $6.0 million. During 2006, an entity in which the Company has a preferred equity investment, located in Montreal, Canada, obtained a non-recourse construction loan, which is collateralized by the respective land and project improvements. Additionally, the Company has provided a guaranty to the lender and the developer partner has provided an indemnity to the Company for 25% of all debt. As of December 31, 2008, there was CAD $89.0 million (approximately USD $72.7 million) outstanding on this construction loan. In connection with the construction of its development projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require performance and surety bonds be posted to guarantee that the Companys obligations are satisfied. These bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. As of December 31, 2008, there were approximately $61.8 million bonds outstanding. 57 Additionally, the RioCan Venture, an entity in which the Company holds a 50% non-controlling interest, has a CAD $7.0 million (approximately USD $5.7 million) letter of credit facility. This facility is jointly guaranteed by RioCan and the Company and had approximately CAD $4.6 million (approximately USD $3.8 million) outstanding as of December 31, 2008, relating to various development projects. During 2005, an entity in which the Company has a preferred equity investment obtained a CAD $24.3 million (approximately USD $19.8 million) credit facility to finance the construction of a 0.1 million square foot shopping center property located in Kamloops, B.C. This facility bears interest at Royal Bank Prime Rate ("RBP") plus 0.5% per annum and was scheduled to mature in March 2008. During 2008, this facility was extended to expire on February 28, 2009. The Company and its partner in this entity each have a limited and several guarantee of CAD $7.5 million (approximately USD $6.1 million) on this facility. As of December 31, 2008, there was CAD $22.3 million (approximately USD $18.2 million) outstanding on this facility. The Company and its partner are currently negotiating with lenders regarding extending or refinancing this debt. During 2005, PL Retail, a joint venture in which the Company holds a 15% non-controlling interest, entered into a $39.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% and was scheduled to mature in February 2008. During 2008, the loan was extended to February 2009. This facility is guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture partner has guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 85% of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. As of December 31, 2008, there was $35.6 million outstanding under this facility. During February 2009, PL Retail made a principal payment of $5.6 million and obtained a one-year extension option at LIBOR plus 400 basis points for the remaining balance of $30.0 million. Additionally, during 2005, the Company acquired three operating properties and one land parcel, through joint ventures, in which the Company holds 50% non-controlling interests. Subsequent to these acquisitions, the joint ventures obtained four individual loans aggregating $20.4 million with interest rates ranging from LIBOR plus 1.00% to LIBOR plus 3.50%. During 2007, one of these properties was sold for a sales price of approximately $10.5 million, including the pay down of $5.0 million of debt. These loans are scheduled to mature in May 2009, October 2009 and December 2009. During 2008, one of the loans was increased by $2.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, there was an aggregate of $17.4 million outstanding on these loans. These loans are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture partner. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures The Company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. These joint ventures operate either shopping center properties or are established for development projects. Such arrangements are generally with third-party institutional investors, local developers and individuals. The properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans, however, the Company, on a selective basis, obtains unsecured financing for certain joint ventures. These unsecured financings are guaranteed by the Company with guarantees from the joint venture partners for their proportionate amounts of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. Non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. The lender generally does not have recourse aga inst any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K). These investments include the following joint ventures: Venture Kimco Ownership Interest Number of Properties Total GLA (in thousands) Non-Recourse Mortgage Payable (in millions) Recourse Notes Payable (in millions) Number of Encumbered Properties Average Interest Rate Weighted Average Term (months) KimPru (c) 15.00% 123 19,382 $2,075.7 $650.0(b) 92 4.64% 64.0 KIR (d) 45.00% 62 13,067 $1,001.0 $ - 49 5.74% 50.4 PL Retail (e) 15.00% 22 5,578 $ 649.0 $ 35.6(b) 22 4.51% 14.9 KUBS (f) 17.89%(a) 43 6,175 $ 759.7 $ - 43 5.62% 78.1 RioCan Venture (g) 50.00% 45 9,283 $ 767.8 $ - 45 5.92% 67.0 (a) Ownership % is a blended rate.

(f) Represents the Companys joint ventures with UBS Wealth Management North American Property Fund Limited. (g) Represents the Companys joint venture with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust. 58 The Company has various other unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. As of December 31, 2008, these unconsolidated joint ventures had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $2.8 billion and unsecured notes payable aggregating approximately $189.4 million. The Companys share of this debt was approximately $1.4 billion. These loans have scheduled maturities ranging from one month to 22 years and bear interest at rates ranging from 1.19% to 10.5% at December 31, 2008. Approximately $312.8 million of the outstanding loan balance matures in 2009. These maturing loans are anticipated to be repaid with operating cash flows, debt refinancing and partner capital contributions, as deemed appropriate. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.) Other Real Estate Investments The Company maintains a Preferred Equity program, which provides capital to developers and owners of real estate properties. The Company accounts for its preferred equity investments under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2008, the Companys net investment under the Preferred Equity Program was approximately $437.3 million relating to 231 properties. As of December 31, 2008, these preferred equity investment properties had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $1.7 billion. Due to the Companys preferred position in these investments, the Companys share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. The Companys maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is primarily limited to its invested capital. Additionally, during July 2007, the Company invested approximately $81.7 million of preferred equity capital in a portfolio comprised of 403 net leased properties which are divided into 30 master leased pools with each pool leased to individual corporate operators. These properties consist of a diverse array of free-standing restaurants, fast food restaurants, convenience and auto parts stores. As of December 31, 2008, these properties were encumbered by third party loans aggregating approximately $428.8 million with interest rates ranging from 5.08% to 10.47% with a weighted average interest rate of 9.3% and maturities ranging from 0.4 years to 14.2 years. During June 2002, the Company acquired a 90% equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of 30 properties. The properties are leased under a long-term bond-type net lease whose primary term expires in 2016, with the lessee having certain renewal option rights. The Companys cash equity investment was approximately $4.0 million. This equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases (as amended). The net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals, estimated unguaranteed residual value, unearned and deferred income and deferred taxes relating to the investment. As of December 31, 2008, 18 of these leveraged lease properties were sold, whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately $31.2 million. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining 12 properties were encumbered by third-party non-recourse debt of approximately $42.8 million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease. As an equity participant in the leveraged lease, the Company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt, which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease. Accordingly, this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease. Effects of Inflation Many of the Company's leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. Most of the Company's leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will, from time-to-time, enter into interest rate protection agreements and/or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Global Market and Economic Conditions; Real Estate and Retail Shopping Sector In the U.S., recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth throughout 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, continued concerns about the systemic impact of the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues and declining equity and real estate markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the U.S. economy. In the third quarter, added concerns fueled by the federal government conservatorship of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association, the declared bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the U.S. government provided loans to American 59 International Group Inc. and other federal government interventions in the U.S. credit markets led to increased market uncertainty and instability in both U.S. and international capital and credit markets. These conditions, combined with volatile oil prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels and has led to the unprecedented deterioration of the U.S. and international equity markets during the fourth quarter of 2008. Historically, real estate has been subject to a wide range of cyclical economic conditions that affect various real estate markets and geographic regions with differing intensities and at different times. Different regions of the United States have and may continue to experience varying degrees of economic growth or distress. Adverse changes in general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the Company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the Companys ability to attract or retain tenants. The Companys shopping centers are typically anchored by two or more national tenants which generally offer day-to-day necessities, rather than high-priced luxury items. In addition, the Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through ownership of a portfolio of properties with a diverse geographic and tenant base. The Company monitors potential credit issues of its tenants, and analyzes the possible effects to the financial statements of the Company and its unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition to the collectability assessment of outstanding accounts receivable, the Company evaluates the related real estate for recoverability as well as any tenant related deferred charges for recoverability, which may include straight-line rents, deferred lease costs, tenant improvements, tenant inducements and intangible assets. The retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions. These conditions may result in our tenants delaying lease commencements or declining to extend or renew leases upon expiration. These conditions also have forced some weaker retailers, in some cases, to declare bankruptcy and/or close stores. Certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection. However, any of these particular store closings affecting the Company often represent a small percentage of the Companys overall gross leasable area and the Company does not currently expect store closings to have a material adverse effect on the Companys overall performance. The decline in market conditions has also had a negative effect on real estate transactional activity as it relates to the acquisition and sale of real estate assets. The Company believes that the lack of real estate transactions will continue throughout 2009 which will curtail the Companys growth in the near term. New Accounting Pronouncements - In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurement (SFAS No. 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. During February 2008, the FASB issued two Staff Positions that (i) partially deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and (ii) removed certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157. The impact of partially adopting SFAS No. 157 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. (See footnote 15 for additional disclosure). In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 159 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations, as the Company did not elect the fair value option for its financial assets and liabilities. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). The objective of this statement is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, this statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: (i) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, (ii) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase, (iii) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination and (iv) requires expensing of transaction costs associated with a business combination. This s tatement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. An entity may not apply it before that date. The impact the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on the Companys financial position and results of operations will be dependent upon the volume of business combinations entered into by the Company. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (FAS 160). FAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate 60 from the parents equity; the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income; changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently; when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained non-controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value; and entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non-controlling owners. The objective of the guidance is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The impact the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on the Companys financial position and results of operations will be dependent upon the volume of transactions which will specifically be impacted by this pronouncement. In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133", (SFAS No. 161) which amends and expands the disclosure requirements of FAS 133 to require qualitative disclosure about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS No. 161 is to be applied prospectively for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. SFAS No. 161 also encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. The adoption of SFAS No. 161 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys disclosures. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP 142-3). FSP 142-3 removes the requirement under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to consider whether an intangible asset can be renewed without substantial cost or material modifications to the existing terms and conditions and replaces it with a requirement that an entity consider its own historical experience in renewing similar arrangements, or a consideration of market participant assumptions in the absence of historical experience. FSP 142-3 also requires entities to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to assess the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with the asset are affected by the entitys intent and/or ability to renew or extend the arrangement. FSP 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The adoption of FS P 142-3 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03-6-1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities," (EITF 03-6-1), which classifies unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) as participating securities and requires them to be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method described in SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share." EITF 03-6-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. All prior-period earnings per share data presented are to be adjusted retrospectively. The Companys adoption of EITF 03-6-1 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN46(R)-8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities, which promptly improves disclosures by public companies until the pending amendments to FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (SFAS No. 140), and FIN 46(R), are finalized and approved by the Board. The FSP amends SFAS No. 140 to require public companies to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets and variable interests in qualifying special-purpose entities. It also amends FIN 46(R) to require public companies to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with variable interest entities. This FSP is effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2008. (See footnotes 3, 7 and 8 for additional disclosure). Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had (i) Canadian investments totaling CAD $444.5 million (approximately USD $363.2 million) comprised of real estate joint venture investments and marketable securities, (ii) Mexican real estate investments of approximately MXP 9.4 billion (approximately USD $695.9 million), (iii) Chilean real estate investments of approximately 15.2 billion Chilean Pesos (approximately USD $24.2 million), (iv) Peruvian real estate investments of approximately 3.7 million Peruvian Nuevo Sol (approximately USD $1.2 million), (v) Brazilian real estate investments of approximately 41.6 million Brazilian Real (BRL) (approximately USD $17.8 million) and (vi) Australian investments in marketable securities of approximately AUD 190.2 million (approximately USD $131.4 million). The foreign currency exchange risk has been partially mitigated, but not eliminated, through the use of local currency denominated debt. The Company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has no other material exposure to market risk. Item 8.

Based on such evaluation, the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. Item 9B. Other Information Bylaw Amendments - On February 25, 2009, our Board of Directors approved amendments to the Companys Bylaws that became effective upon adoption. The following summarizes these amendments. Advance Notice and Indemnification Matters · Article II, Section 12 of the Bylaws was amended with respect to the advance notice provisions for stockholder nominations for director and stockholder business proposals. The amendments expand the information required to be disclosed by the stockholder making the nomination or proposal including, among other items, (a) information about persons controlling, or acting in concert with, such stockholder, (b) the proponents investment strategy or objective and any related disclosure document the proponent has provided to its investors and (c) information about the extent to which the proponent has hedged its interest in the Company. · Article V was amended to further clarify that subsequent amendments to Article V do not alter a director or officers entitlement to indemnification and advance of expenses. Meetings of Stockholders · Article II, Section 2 was amended to remove the reference to the month of the annual meeting of stockholders. · Article II, Section 3 was amended to clarify the procedures for stockholders to request the calling of a special meeting of stockholders. · Article II, Section 7 was amended to (a) provide for householding of notices of a meeting of stockholders, as permitted by the MGCL and the SECs rules applicable to delivery of stockholder proxy statements and (b) clarify the procedures for the postponement of a meeting. A copy of the Companys Amended and Restated Bylaws is attached as Exhibit 3.2 to this report. The foregoing is a brief description of the amendments to the Bylaws that is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Companys Amended and Restated Bylaws, which is incorporated by reference herein. 63 Indemnification Agreement  On February 25, 2009, our Board of Directors approved a form of Indemnification Agreement (the Indemnification Agreement) to be entered into between the Company and each of its executive officers, members of the Board of Directors and such other employees or consultants of the Company or any subsidiary as may be determined from time to time by our Chief Executive Officer in his discretion (each, an Indemnitee). The Indemnification Agreement provides that the Company will indemnify each Indemnitee against any and all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, Losses) actually and necessarily incurred by the Indemnitee or on his behalf, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in connection with any present or future threatened, pending or completed proceeding based upon, arising from, relating to or by reason of the Indemnitees status as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or any other entity the Indemnitee serves at the request of the Company. The Indemnitee will also be indemnified against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with a proceeding if the Indemnitee is, by reason of his service to the Company or other entity at the Companys request, a witness in any such proceeding to which he is not a party. No indemnification shall be made under the Indemnification Agreement on account of Indemnitees conduct in respect of any proceeding charging impersonal benefit to the Indemnitee, whether or not involving action in the Indemnitees official capacity, in which the Indemnitee was adjudged to be liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received. In addition to certain other exclusions set forth in the Indemnification Agreement, the Company will also not be obligated to make any indemnity or advance in connection with any claim made against the Indemnitee (a) for which payment has been made to the Indemnitee under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision, (b) for an accounting of short-swing profits made by Indemnitee from securities of the Company within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or, subject to certain exceptions, (c) prior to a change in control of the Company, in connection with any proceeding initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors, officers, employees or other Indemnitees. The Company will advance, to the extent not prohibited by law, the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any proceeding. The Indemnification Agreement provides procedures for determining the Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification and advancement of expenses in the event of a claim. The Indemnitee is required to deliver to the Company a written affirmation of the Indemnitees good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Company as authorized by law has been met and a written undertaking to reimburse any expenses if it shall ultimately be established that the standard of conduct has not been met. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in the Indemnification Agreement is unavailable to the Indemnitee for any reason, then the Company, in lieu of indemnifying and holding harmless the Indemnitee, shall pay the entire amount of Losses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any proceeding without requiring the Indemnitee to contribute to such payment, and the Company further waives and relinquishes any right of contribution it may have at any time against the Indemnitee. The Company shall not enter into any settlement of any proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with the Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such proceeding) unless such settlement provides for a full and final release of all claims asserted against the Indemnitee. Furthermore, the Company agrees to fully indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnitee from any claims for contribution which may be brought by officers, directors or employees of the Company oth er than the Indemnitee who may be jointly liable with the Indemnitee. A copy of the form of the Indemnification Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.16 to this report. The foregoing is a brief description of the terms and conditions of the Indemnification Agreement that are material to the Company and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.16 hereto, which is incorporated by reference herein. 64 PART III Item 10.

Valuation and Qualifying Accounts 127 III. Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation 128 IV. Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 144 72 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Kimco Realty Corporation: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kimco Realty Corporation and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Int egrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audi ts of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detecti on of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New York, New York February 26, 2009 73 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (in thousands, except share information) December 31, December 31, 2008 2007 Assets: Real Estate Rental property Land $ 1,395,645 $ 1,262,879 Building and improvements 5,454,296 4,917,750 6,849,941 6,180,629 Less, accumulated depreciation and amortization 1,159,664 977,444 5,690,277 5,203,185 Real estate under development 968,975 1,144,406 Real estate, net 6,659,252 6,347,591 Investments and advances in real estate joint ventures 1,161,382 1,246,917 Other real estate investments 566,324 615,016 Mortgages and other financing receivables 181,992 153,847 Cash and cash equivalents 136,177 87,499 Marketable securities 258,174 212,988 Accounts and notes receivable 97,702 88,017 Deferred charges and prepaid expenses 122,481 121,690 Other assets 213,663 224,251 Total assets $ 9,397,147 $ 9,097,816 Liabilities & Stockholders' Equity: Notes payable $ 3,440,818 $ 3,131,765 Mortgages payable 847,491 838,736 Construction loans payable 268,337 245,914 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 151,241 161,526 Dividends payable 131,097 112,052 Other liabilities 237,577 265,090 Total liabilities 5,076,561 4,755,083 Minority interests 345,240 448,159 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders' equity: Preferred Stock , $1.00 par value, authorized 3,232,000 shares Class F Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value, authorized 700,000 shares 700 700 Issued and outstanding 700,000 shares Aggregate liquidation preference $175,000 Class G Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value, authorized 184,000 shares 184 184 Issued and outstanding 184,000 shares Aggregate liquidation preference $460,000 Common stock, $.01 par value, authorized 750,000,000 shares Issued 271,080,525 and 253,350,144 shares;

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Business Kimco Realty Corporation (the "Company" or "Kimco"), its subsidiaries, affiliates and related real estate joint ventures are engaged principally in the operation of neighborhood and community shopping centers which are anchored generally by discount department stores, supermarkets or drugstores. The Company also provides property management services for shopping centers owned by affiliated entities, various real estate joint ventures and unaffiliated third parties. Additionally, in connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 (the "RMA"), which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"), subject to certain limitations. As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including (i) merchant building through its wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries(TRS), which are primarily engaged in the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition service s which primarily focuses on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed and/or bankrupt retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions. The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single property and a large tenant base. At December 31, 2008, the Company's single largest neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for only 1.0% of the Company's annualized base rental revenues and only 0.9% of the Companys total shopping center gross leasable area ("GLA"). At December 31, 2008, the Companys five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohls and Wal-Mart, which represented approximately 3.3%, 2.8%, 2.5%, 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively, of the Companys annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. The principal business of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is the ownership, development, management and operation of retail shopping centers, including complementary services that capitalize on the Companys established retail real estate expertise. The Company does not distinguish its principal business or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of measuring performance. Accordingly, the Company believes it has a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Principles of Consolidation and Estimates The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned, and all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest, including where the Company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46(R)") or meets certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member as identified in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04-5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership when the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners have Certain Rights ("EITF 04-5"). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the valuation of real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, the assessment of impairments of real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, 79 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued equity method investments, marketable securities and other investments, as well as, depreciable lives, revenue recognition, the collectability of trade accounts receivable and the realizability of deferred tax assets. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Minority Interests Minority interests represent the portion of equity that the Company does not own in those entities it consolidates as a result of having a controlling interest or determined that the Company was the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of FIN 46(R). Minority interests also include partnership units issued from consolidated subsidiaries of the Company in connection with certain property acquisitions. These units have a stated redemption value or a redemption amount based upon the Adjusted Current Trading Price, as defined, of the Companys common stock ("Common Stock") and provide the unit holders various rates of return during the holding period. The unit holders generally have the right to redeem their units for cash at any time after one year from issuance. The Company typically has the option to settle redemption amounts in cash or Common Stock for the issuance of convertible units. The Company evaluates the terms of the partnership units issued in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity, and EITF D-98, Classif ication and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, to determine if the units are mandatorily redeemable and as such accounts for them accordingly. The acquisitions of minority interests, through the redemption of redeemable units, for shares of Common Stock are recorded under the purchase method at the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of acquisition. The acquisition amounts are allocated to the underlying total assets of the Company based on their estimated fair values. Real Estate Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. If there is an event or a change in circumstances that indicates that the basis of a property (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable, then management will assess any impairment in value by making a comparison of (i) the current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its estimated holding period, and (ii) the net carrying amount of the property. If the current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property, the carrying value would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. When a real estate asset is identified by management as held-for-sale, the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price, net of selling costs. If, in managements opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. Upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships), assumed debt and redeemable units issued in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations ("SFAS No. 141"), at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the initial purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. As final information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation. The allocations are finalized within twelve months of the acquisition date. The Company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property "as-if-vacant". The fair value reflects the depreciated replacement cost of the permanent assets, with no trade fixtures included. 80 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued In allocating the purchase price to identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, the value of above-market and below-market leases is estimated based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the leases and managements estimate of the market lease rates and other lease provisions (i.e., expense recapture, base rental changes, etc.) measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining term of the lease. The capitalized above-market or below-market intangible is amortized to rental income over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases. Mortgage debt premiums are amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt instrument. Unit discounts and premiums are amortized into Minority interest in income, net over the period from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date of the units. In determining the value of in-place leases, management considers current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in arriving at an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease-up period from vacant to existing occupancy. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance, other operating expenses, estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods and costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related costs based on current market demand. In estimating the value of tenant relationships, management considers the nature and extent of the existing tenant relationship, the expectation of lease renewals, growth prospects and tenant credit quality, among other factors. The value assigned to in-place leases and tenant relationships is amortized over the estimated remaining term of the leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its scheduled expiration, all unamortized costs relating to that lease would be written off. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: Buildings and building improvements 15 to 50 years Fixtures, leasehold and tenant improvements Terms of leases or useful (including certain identified intangible assets) lives, whichever is shorter Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized. The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life. Real Estate Under Development Real estate under development represents both the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion and projects which the Company may hold as long-term investments. These properties are carried at cost. The cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. If, in managements opinion, the net sales price of assets held for resale or the current and projected undiscounted cash flows of these assets to be held as long-term investments is less than the net carrying value, the carrying value would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the Company exercises significant influence, but does not control these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions. Earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable, based upon an allocation of the investments net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period. 81 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued The Companys joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co-investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties, consistent with its core business. These joint ventures typically obtain non-recourse third-party financing on their property investments, thus contractually limiting the Companys exposure to losses primarily to the amount of its equity investment; and due to the lenders exposure to losses, a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk. The Companys exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments. The Company, on a selective basis, obtains unsecured financing for certain joint ventures. These unsecured financings are guaranteed by the Company with guarantees from the joint venture partners for their proportionate amounts of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. On a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including the underlying investment property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the Companys investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. An investments value is impaired only if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. The Companys estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each specific property that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. Capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon rates that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for each respective property. Other Real Estate Investments Other real estate investments primarily consist of preferred equity investments for which the Company provides capital to developers and owners of real estate. The Company typically accounts for its preferred equity investments on the equity method of accounting, whereby earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and based upon an allocation of the investments net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period. On a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including the underlying investment property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the Companys Other real estate investments may be impaired. An investments value is impaired only if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. The Companys estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each specific property that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. Capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon rates that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for each respective property. Mortgages and Other Financing Receivables Mortgages and other financing receivables consist of loans acquired and loans originated by the Company. Loan receivables are recorded at stated principal amounts net of any discount or premium or deferred loan origination costs or fees. The related discounts or premiums on mortgages and other loans purchased are amortized or accreted over the life of the related loan receivable. The Company defers certain loan origination and commitment fees, net of certain origination costs and amortizes them as an adjustment of the loans yield over the term of the related loan. The Company evaluates the collectability of both interest and principal on each loan to determine whether it is impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired, when based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considere d to be impaired, the amount of loss is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loans effective interest rate or to the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateralized. Interest income on performing loans is accrued as earned. Interest income on impaired loans is recognized on a cash basis. 82 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents (demand deposits in banks, commercial paper and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less) includes tenants' security deposits, escrowed funds and other restricted deposits approximating $12.5 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash and cash equivalent balances may, at a limited number of banks and financial institutions, exceed insurable amounts. The Company believes it mitigates risk by investing in or through major financial institutions and primarily in funds that are currently U.S. federal government insured. Recoverability of investments is dependent upon the performance of the issuers. Marketable Securities The Company classifies its existing marketable equity securities as available-for-sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. These securities are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI"). Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. All debt securities are generally classified as held-to-maturity because the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Debt securities which contain conversion features are generally classified as available-for-sale. On a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Companys marketable securities may be impaired. A marketable security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than the carrying value of the security and such difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the security over the estimated fair value in the security. Deferred Leasing and Financing Costs Costs incurred in obtaining tenant leases and long-term financing, included in deferred charges and prepaid expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, are amortized over the terms of the related leases or debt agreements, as applicable. Such capitalized costs include salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved in successful leasing efforts. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recognized once the required sales level is achieved. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. Management and other fee income consists of property management fees, leasing fees, property acquisition and disposition fees, development fees and asset management fees. These fees arise from contractual agreements with third parties or with entities in which the Company has a partial non-controlling interest. Management and other fee income, including acquisition and disposition fees, are recognized as earned under the respective agreements. Management and other fee income related to partially owned entities are recognized to the extent attributable to the unaffiliated interest. Gains and losses from the sale of depreciated operating property and ground-up development projects are generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate ("SFAS No. 66"), provided that various criteria relating to the terms of sale and subsequent involvement by the Company with the properties are met. 83 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Gains and losses on transfers of operating properties result from the sale of a partial interest in properties to unconsolidated joint ventures and are recognized using the partial sale provisions of SFAS No. 66. The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. Income Taxes The Company has made an election to qualify, and believes it is operating so as to qualify, as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income as defined under Section 856 through 860 of the Code. In connection with the RMA, which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted to participate in certain activities which it was previously precluded from in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code. As such, the Company is subject to federal and state income taxes on the income from these activities. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions Assets and liabilities of the Companys foreign operations are translated using year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates as determined throughout the year. Gains or losses resulting from translation are included in OCI, as a separate component of the Companys stockholders equity. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are translated to local currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The effect of the transactions gain or loss is included in the caption Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Derivative/Financial Instruments The Company measures its derivative instruments at fair value and records them in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an asset or liability, depending on the Companys rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract. In addition, the fair value adjustments will be recorded in either stockholders equity or earnings in the current period based on the designation of the derivative. The effective portions of changes in fair value of cash flow hedges are reported in OCI and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency hedges that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are included in the cumulative translation component of OCI to the extent they are economically effective and are subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged investments are sold or otherwise disposed of. The changes in fair value of de rivative instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of hedges are recorded in earnings for the current period. The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market fluctuations on equity securities. The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. The Company has not entered, and does not plan to enter, into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Additionally, the 84 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Company has a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with major financial institutions. The principal financial instruments used by the Company are interest rate swaps, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and warrant contracts. These derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow, fair value or foreign currency hedges (see Note 16). Earnings Per Share The following table sets forth the reconciliation of earnings and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share (amounts presented in thousands, except per share data): 2008 2007 2006 Computation of Basic Earnings Per Share: Income from continuing operations before extraordinary gain $ 223,404 $ 356,283 $ 340,330 Gain on transfer of operating properties 1,195 - 1,394 Gain on sale of operating properties, net of tax 587 2,708 1,066 Preferred stock dividends (47,288) (19,659) (11,638) Income from continuing operations before extraordinary gain applicable to common shares 177,898 339,332 331,152 Income from discontinued operations 24,716 33,574 85,469 Extraordinary gain - 50,265 - Net income applicable to common shares $ 202,614 $ 423,171 $ 416,621 Weighted average common shares outstanding 257,811 252,129 239,552 Basic Earnings Per Share: Income from continuing operations before extraordinary gain $ 0.69 $ 1.35 $ 1.38 Income from discontinued operations 0.10 0.13 0.36 Extraordinary gain - 0.20 - Net income $ 0.79 $ 1.68 $ 1.74 Computation of Diluted Earnings Per Share: Income from continuing operations before extraordinary gain applicable to common shares $ 177,898 $ 339,332 $ 331,152 Distributions on convertible units (a) 18 - - Income from continuing operations for diluted earnings per share 177,916 339,332 331,152 Income from discontinued operations 24,716 33,574 85,469 Extraordinary gain - 50,265 - Net income for diluted earnings per common share $ 202,632 $ 423,171 $ 416,621 Weighted average common shares outstanding  Basic 257,811 252,129 239,552 Effect of dilutive securities: Stock options/deferred stock awards 999 4,929 5,063 Assumed conversion of convertible units (a) 33 - - Shares for diluted earnings per common share 258,843 257,058 244,615 Diluted Earnings Per Share: Income from continuing operations before extraordinary gain $ 0.69 $ 1.32 $ 1.35 Income from discontinued operations 0.09 0.13 0.35 Extraordinary gain - 0.20 - Net income $ 0.78 $ 1.65 $ 1.70 (a) The effect of the assumed conversion of certain convertible units had an anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of Income from continuing operations before extraordinary gain per share. Accordingly, the impact of such conversions has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share calculations. In addition, there were approximately 13,731,767, 3,017,400, and 71,250, stock options that were anti-dilutive as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 85 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued Stock Compensation The Company maintains an equity participation plan (the Plan) pursuant to which a maximum of 47,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock may be issued for qualified and non-qualified options and restricted stock grants. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors at its sole discretion, options granted under the Plan generally vest ratably over a range of three to five years, expire ten years from the date of grant and are exercisable at the market price on the date of grant. Restricted stock grants vest 100% on the fourth or fifth anniversary of the grant. In addition, the Plan provides for the granting of certain options and restricted stock to each of the Companys non-employee directors (the Independent Directors) and permits such Independent Directors to elect to receive deferred stock awards in lieu of directors fees. The Company accounts for stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). SFAS 123R requires that all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the statement of operations over the service period based on their fair values. Fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula, intended to estimate the fair value of the awards at the grant date. (See footnote 21 for additional disclosure on the assumptions and methodology.) New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurement (SFAS No. 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. During February 2008, the FASB issued two Staff Positions that (i) partially deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and (ii) removed certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157. The impact of partially adopting SFAS No. 157 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. (See footnote 15 for additional disclosure). In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 159 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations, as the Company did not elect the fair value option for its financial assets and liabilities. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). The objective of this statement is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, this statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: (i) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, (ii) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase, (iii) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination and (iv) requires expensing of transaction costs associated with a business combination. This statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. An entity may not apply it before that date. The impact the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on the Companys financial position and results of operations will be dependent upon the volume of business combinations entered into by the Company. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (FAS 160). FAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity; the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income; changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently; when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained non-controlling equity investment in the 86 KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value; and entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non-controlling owners. The objective of the guidance is to improve the relevance, comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The impact the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on the Companys financial position and results of operations, will be dependent upon the volume of transactions which will specifically be impacted by this pronouncement. In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133", (SFAS No. 161) which amends and expands the disclosure requirements of FAS 133 to require qualitative disclosure about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS No. 161 is to be applied prospectively for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. SFAS No. 161 also encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. The adoption of SFAS No. 161 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys disclosures. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP 142-3). FSP 142-3 removes the requirement under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to consider whether an intangible asset can be renewed without substantial cost or material modifications to the existing terms and conditions, and replaces it with a requirement that an entity consider its own historical experience in renewing similar arrangements, or a consideration of market participant assumptions in the absence of historical experience. FSP 142-3 also requires entities to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to assess the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with the asset are affected by the entitys intent and/or ability to renew or extend the arrangement. FSP 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier ado ption is prohibited. The adoption of FSP 142-3 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03-6-1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities," (EITF 03-6-1), which classifies unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) as participating securities and requires them to be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method described in SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share." EITF 03-6-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. All prior-period earnings per share data presented are to be adjusted retrospectively. The Company adoption of EITF 03-6-1 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN46(R)-8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities, which promptly improves disclosures by public companies until the pending amendments to FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (SFAS No. 140), and FIN 46(R), are finalized and approved by the Board. The FSP amends SFAS No. 140 to require public companies to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets and variable interests in qualifying special-purpose entities. It also amends FIN 46(R) to require public companies to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with variable interest entities.
