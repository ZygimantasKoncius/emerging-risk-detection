Risk Factors. In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following risk factors. Any of these risks or the occurrence of any one or more uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common shares. Risks Related to Our Business The disruptions in the credit and real estate markets may continue to adversely affect our business. Since mid-2007, the credit markets and the markets for real estate assets have been subject to unprecedented disruptions, which has had a material adverse effect on us. These disruptions have resulted in severe limitations on the availability of credit and a deterioration in the value of real estate assets causing a significant increase in defaults by our borrowers in their monetary obligations to us, declining revenues and increased expenses, including significant increases in provisions for loan losses and impairment charges, losses sustained in the operation of real estate properties acquired in foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure related professional fees. The continuing limitation of credit and the further devaluation of real estate assets may adversely impact our results of operations in the future. If defaults on our loans continue, it will result in continuing declines in revenues and net income. Loan defaults result in a decrease in interest income and may require the establishment of, or an increase in, loan loss reserves. The decrease in interest income resulting from loan defaults may be for a prolonged period of time as we seek to recover, primarily through legal proceedings, the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest due on a defaulted loan, plus the legal costs incurred in pursuing our legal remedies. Legal proceedings, which may include foreclosure actions and bankruptcy proceedings, are expensive and time consuming. The decrease in interest income, and the costs involved in pursuing our legal remedies will reduce the amount of cash available to meet our expenses. In addition, the decrease in interest income, the costs incurred by us in a defaulted loan situation and increases in loan loss reserves will have an adverse impact on our net income, taxable income, and shareholders' equity. During Fiscal 2009, loans aggregating $68,184,000, before loan loss allowances, became non-earning. In Fiscal 2009 we acquired title to properties securing $56,448,000 of non-performing loans, before loan loss allowances, in foreclosure proceedings, and these loans were reclassified to real estate properties or real estate properties held for sale at a book value of $40,512,000, after chargeoffs of $15,936,000. Non-earning loans (including loans held for sale) represented 23.5% of the principal balance of our outstanding loans and 9.9% of our total assets at September 30, 2009. The non-payment of interest income on non-earning loans had the effect of reducing our revenues by $4,141,000 in Fiscal 2009. Continuing uncertainty in the credit and real estate markets may result in additional defaults by our borrowers in the future. Decrease in our loan originations will negatively affect our results of operations. In the current recessionary environment, potential borrowers have little or no need for short-term bridge loans, as their activity in the real estate markets has been curtailed or has slowed down to a significant extent. In addition, we are concerned with the ability of potential borrowers to refinance or sell properties in order to repay our loans and therefore we have been very conservative in originating loans. As a result, there was an 81% decrease in the amount of loans originated by us in Fiscal 2009 (excluding senior purchase money mortgages provided by us to facilitate the sale of real estate properties acquired by us in foreclosure), as compared to Fiscal 2008. Interest and fees earned on our loan portfolio, including purchase money mortgages but excluding loans held for sale, was $9,710,000, 15 $18,772,000 and $38,757,000 in Fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, resulting in part from an 81% decrease in originations in Fiscal 2009 as compared to Fiscal 2008 and a 45% decrease in originations in Fiscal 2008 as compared to Fiscal 2007. Until there are positive changes in the credit and real estate markets and an increased demand for bridge loans, the level of our loan originations will continue at a reduced level, which would negatively affect our revenues, net income, shareholders' equity and may result in our operating at a cash flow deficit in Fiscal 2010. We do not have a credit facility, which will limit our loan origination activity. At September 30, 2009 and December 8, 2009, we had $25,708,000 and approximately $55,000,000, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents and $8,963,000 and approximately $5,000,000, respectively, of securities available-for-sale, or a total of $34,671,000 and approximately $60,000,000, respectively, available for loan originations and operations. Although the sale of real estate properties and loans would make additional funds available for loan originations, the time frame within which these properties and loans could be sold and potential proceeds generated to us is not predictable. Since we do not currently have a credit facility, if we are unable to obtain a new credit facility, we will be limited in the amount of mortgage loans we can originate, which will limit our revenues and operating results. Although we are in discussions with respect to a new credit facility, there can be no assurance that a new credit facility will be secured or that the terms will be acceptable to us. We incurred substantial loan loss provisions and impairment charges in Fiscal 2009 and may incur additional loan loss provisions and impairment charges in Fiscal 2010. We evaluate our loan loss provisions and impairment charges quarterly. Our loan loss provisions and impairment charges reflect management's judgment of the probability and severity of loan losses and the decline in the value of real estate property assets owned by us and securing our loans. The valuation process, which is inherently difficult, is particularly difficult during a recession in which the availability of credit is severely limited and commercial real estate transactions have significantly decreased. Regardless of the loan loss provisions we have taken with respect to our loans or impairment charges we have taken with respect to real estate properties owned, additional provisions and impairments may be required in the future as a result of factors beyond our control, including, among other things, the continuation or downward acceleration of the economic recession and changes in market conditions affecting the value of loan collateral and real property assets. If our loan loss provisions or impairment charges prove inadequate to cover actual losses, we could suffer additional losses. Due to the credit crisis and the significant decrease in commercial real estate values, we incurred substantial loan loss provisions and impairment charges in Fiscal 2009. These loan loss provisions and impairment charges have been responsible to a significant extent for the losses we sustained in Fiscal 2009. We believe these loan loss provisions and impairment charges have depressed our stock price, harmed our liquidity and adversely impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so. Our loans and real estate properties may suffer additional impairments in the future causing us to recognize additional losses. We may be forced to sell our assets at a time when the market is depressed in order to support or enhance our liquidity. Despite our need to sell our assets, we may be unable to make such sales on favorable terms or at all, further materially damaging our liquidity and operations. Current economic conditions and turmoil in the credit markets expose us to a variety of risks. Current economic conditions, the availability and cost of credit, the weak mortgage market, and declining real estate values have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for real estate markets. The recessionary economic conditions in the United States may continue and may cause 16 a significant increase in vacancy rates at commercial and multi-family properties in the future. Current economic conditions and the credit crisis may also cause real estate property values to decline further and these declines could reduce the proceeds we receive upon sale of real estate property assets, if we are able to sell our properties, or adversely impact our ability to lease our real estate properties. Current economic conditions and the credit crisis may also cause our borrowers to default in their payment obligations to us. The Newark Joint Venture may have an operating loss for the foreseeable future. Included in our real estate assets are the properties owned by the Newark Joint Venture, which properties have an aggregate book value of $38,750,000 at September 30, 2009. The Newark Joint Venture properties represent 56% and 20%, respectively, of our real property assets and total assets at September 30, 2009. We anticipate that the Newark Joint Venture will operate at a loss in Fiscal 2010 and will continue to operate at a loss for several years. If the Newark Joint Venture operates at a loss, we and our Newark Joint Venture partners will be required to fund the losses by making additional capital contributions, on a pro rata basis. Although it is possible that the need to make additional contributions will be mitigated by the sale of some of the Newark Joint Venture properties or financing secured by the Newark Joint Venture for the operation and/or development of its sites, currently, there are no agreements to sell any of the Newark Joint Venture properties or any financing commitments issued, and there is no assurance that any agreement or commitment will be obtained in the foreseeable future. The operations of the Newark Joint Venture could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity for a number of years. We have limited experience in developing and operating assemblage sites. The principal assets of our Newark Joint Venture are assemblage sites and additional properties located in downtown Newark, NJ. Since real estate development is not a business in which we have previously engaged, we are subject to risks that differ from those to which we have been subject to historically. Although the principal of the managing member of the Newark Joint Venture (who is formerly the principal of our borrowers) is knowledgeable with respect to the local real estate market, neither he nor we are experienced in real estate development activities. As a result, in order to redevelop these assemblage sites, the Newark Joint Venture will have to hire personnel knowledgeable in real estate development to assist in its development, become involved with a development partner, or sell some or all of the sites to developers or potential users. There can be no assurance that the Newark Joint Venture will be successful in hiring experienced personnel, finding a development partner with skills needed to develop and/or manage the redevelopment of the sites, or that we will be able to sell some or all of the properties to developers or potential users. The success of our Newark Joint Venture depends, to a large extent, on the principal of the Newark Joint Venture's manager. The principal of the manager of the Newark Joint Venture was responsible for acquiring all the properties owned by the Newark Joint Venture. We believe that the principal's continued involvement is important to the success of the Newark Joint Venture. The diminution or loss of his services due to disability, death or for any other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the Newark Joint Venture's business, which would result in a material adverse effect on our business. The Newark Joint Venture carries key man life insurance on the principal of the manager of the Newark Joint Venture in the amount of $20,000,000. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from such life insurance would be sufficient to compensate the Newark Joint Venture for the loss of his services, and these policies do not provide any benefits if he becomes disabled or is otherwise unable to render services to the Newark Joint Venture. 17 The geographic concentration of our portfolio may make our revenues and the value of our portfolio vulnerable to adverse changes in local economic conditions. Although we originate and hold for investment loans secured by real property located anywhere in the United States, currently 78% of our outstanding loans (including loans held for sale) are secured by properties located in the New York metropolitan area. In addition, 56% of our real estate assets are located in Newark, NJ. A lack of geographical diversification makes our mortgage portfolio and real estate property holdings more sensitive to local or regional economic conditions. In particular, if there is a significant decline in the economy of the New York metropolitan area (including Newark, NJ), this could result in a greater risk of default under our loans compared with the default rate for loans secured by properties in other geographic locations and a greater risk of a decrease in the value of our real estate assets compared with a decrease in value of properties located in other geographic locations. This could result in a reduction of our revenues, increases in our loan loss allowances and impairment charges and a reduction of our net income, which reductions and increases might not be as acute if our portfolio were more geographically diverse. In order for real estate properties to generate positive cash flow or to make real estate properties suitable for sale, we may need to make significant capital improvements and incur deferred maintenance costs to these properties. Some of the properties we acquired or will acquire in foreclosure proceedings may face competition from newer, more updated properties. In order to remain competitive and increase occupancy at these properties and/or make them attractive to potential purchasers, we may have to make significant capital improvements and/or incur deferred maintenance costs with respect to these properties. The cost of these improvements and deferred maintenance items may impair our financial performance and our liquidity. Financing with high loan-to-value ratios involves increased risk of loss and may adversely affect us. Our primary source of recovery in the event of a loan default is the real estate property underlying a defaulted loan. Therefore, the value of our loan depends upon the value of the underlying real estate property. The value of the underlying property is dependent on numerous factors outside of our control, including national, regional and local business and economic conditions, inflation, government economic policies and the availability of credit. A loan-to-value ratio is the ratio of the amount of our loan to the estimated market value of the property underlying a loan, as determined by our internal valuation process. In the current economic environment, the market value of real property underlying our loans has, in a significant number of cases, decreased to less than the principal balance due on our loan. The higher the loan to value ratio, the greater the risk that the amount obtainable from sale of a property will be insufficient to repay the loan in full upon default. In order to facilitate the sale of our real estate properties in Fiscal 2009, we provided seller financing to several purchasers and may continue to do so in the future. Due to the current credit crisis, institutional lenders have adopted restrictive and onerous lending policies and significantly increased the costs of borrowing, making it very difficult for potential purchasers to secure financing for the purchase of a property. In Fiscal 2009 we sold properties for an aggregate of $42,929,000, of which we received an aggregate of $25,152,000 in cash and provided an aggregate of $17,777,000 of fixed rate senior purchase money mortgages in order to facilitate the sale of properties we acquired in foreclosure proceedings. As a result, we only received a portion of the sales proceeds from these properties at closing, and the balance of the sales proceeds is at risk if the purchaser defaults under the terms of the seller financing we provided. Since we may provide senior purchase money mortgages in the future, we may only receive a portion of the sales proceeds at closing and will only receive the balance of the sales proceeds if the purchaser does not default under the 18 terms of any seller financing we may provide. The sale of properties with seller financing also affects our liquidity. It is highly unlikely that we will declare any dividends in 2010. In December 2008, our board of trustees suspended the payment of our regular quarterly dividends. Except for a special capital gain dividend of $1.15 per share paid on October 30, 2009, of which 10% of the total dividend amount was paid in cash and the balance in our common shares, no other dividends were declared or paid in Fiscal 2009. In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute 90% of our taxable income. At December 31, 2008, we had a tax loss carry-forward of $16,800,000 and we anticipate a taxable loss ranging between $31,000,000 and $37,000,000 in calendar 2009. We can offset our future taxable income against our tax loss carry-forward for twenty years or until the tax loss carry-forward has been fully used, whichever occurs first. As a result, we do not expect to pay a dividend in calendar 2010 and it is unlikely that we will be required to pay a dividend for several years thereafter in order to maintain our REIT status. Our board of trustees considers the payment of dividends at its quarterly board meeting. At the present time there is no expectation that a dividend will be paid in the 2010 calendar year or for a number of years thereafter. The non-payment of dividends may negatively impact the price of our common shares. Risks of cost overruns and noncompletion of renovation of properties underlying rehabilitation loans or condominium conversions may result in significant losses. The renovation or refurbishment by a borrower of the property securing our loan involves risks of cost overruns and noncompletion. If such renovation or refurbishment is not completed in a timely manner, or if it costs more than projected, the borrower may experience a prolonged impairment of net operating income and may be unable to make payments on our loan, which could result in reduced income to us. In addition we may be required to complete the renovation or refurbishment if we acquire the property in foreclosure proceedings. The increased risk of loans secured by unimproved land may harm our results of operations. From time-to-time, we provide loans that are secured by unimproved land. Land loans are subject to a higher risk of default because such properties are not income producing properties. In addition, the market value of such properties is volatile. Although we only make loans on undeveloped land if entitlements and zoning is in place for the intended use, there is always the risk that entitlements and zoning may be changed or lapse. Consequently, in the event of a default and foreclosure, we may not be able to sell undeveloped land for an amount equal to our investment and we may lose a significant portion of our investment. In the event of our acquisition of undeveloped land in foreclosure proceedings, we may elect to hold the property until the market becomes more favorable. In such case during the holding period, which could be for a number of years, we will not receive any income from this property and we will be required to pay the costs of carrying the property, primarily real estate taxes and insurance, which could adversely affect our net income and shareholders' equity. We are subject to the risks associated with loan participations, such as lack of full control rights. Some of our investments are participating interests in loans in which we share the rights, obligations and benefits of the loan with participating lenders pursuant to a participation agreement. We may need the consent of these parties to exercise our rights under such loans, including rights with respect to amendment of loan documentation, the institution of, and control over, foreclosure actions, entering into forbearance agreements with borrowers, and sale of the underlying property upon 19 acquisition in foreclosure. Our participant may have interests and goals that are different from ours and may desire an action or position which we oppose. We may have less control of our investment when we invest in joint ventures. From time-to-time, we have entered into joint venture agreements. Our co-venturers may have different interests or goals than we do and our co-venturers may not be able or willing to take an action that is desired by us. A disagreement with respect to the activities of the joint venture could result in a substantial diversion of time and effort by our management and could result in our exercise, or one of our co-venturers exercise, of the buy/sell provision often contained in our joint venture organizational documents. In addition, there is no limitation under our charter documents as to the amount of funds that we may invest in joint ventures. Accordingly, we could invest a substantial amount of our funds in joint ventures which ultimately may not be profitable as a result of disagreements with and among our co-venturers. Liability relating to environmental matters may impact the value of properties that we may acquire upon foreclosure of the properties underlying our investments. To the extent we foreclose on properties with respect to which we have extended mortgage loans, we may be subject to environmental liabilities arising from such foreclosed properties. Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal of certain hazardous substances released on its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. The presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect an owner's ability to sell real estate or borrow using real estate as collateral. To the extent that an owner of a property underlying one of our loans becomes liable for removal costs, the ability of the owner to make payments to us may be reduced, which in turn may adversely affect the value of the relevant mortgage asset held by us. If we foreclose on properties underlying our loans, the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property and we may incur substantial remediation costs. The discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to such properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive market. We compete with many third parties engaged in finance and real estate investment activities, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private lending companies, investment funds and other entities. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do and generally may be able to accept more risk. As such, they have the ability to make larger loans and to reduce the risk of loss from any one loan by having a more diversified loan portfolio. They may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, enhanced operating efficiencies. An increase in the availability of funds to lenders, or a decrease in the amount of borrowing activity, may increase competition for making loans and may reduce obtainable yields or increase the credit risk inherent in the available loans. Our revenues and the value of our portfolio may be negatively affected by casualty events occurring on properties securing our loans. We require our borrowers to obtain, for our benefit, comprehensive insurance covering the property and any improvements to the property collateralizing our loan in an amount intended to be sufficient to provide for the cost of replacement in the event of casualty. In addition, joint ventures in which we are an equity participant carry comprehensive insurance covering the property and any 20 improvements to the property owned by the joint venture for the cost of replacement in the event of a casualty. Further, we carry insurance for such purpose on properties owned by us. However, the amount of insurance coverage maintained for any property may not be sufficient to pay the full replacement cost following a casualty event. In addition, the rent loss coverage under a policy may not extend for the full period of time that a tenant may be entitled to a rent abatement that is a result of, or that may be required to complete restoration following a casualty event. In addition, there are certain types of losses, such as those arising from earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and terrorist attacks, that may be uninsurable or that may not be economically insurable. Changes in zoning, building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors may make it impossible for our borrower, a joint venture or us, as the case may be, to use insurance proceeds to replace damaged or destroyed improvements at a property. If any of these or similar events occur, the amount of coverage may not be sufficient to replace a damaged or destroyed property and/or to repay in full the amount due on all loans collateralized by such property. As a result, our returns and the value of our investment may be reduced. Senior management and other key personnel are critical to our business and our future success may depend on our ability to retain them. We depend on the services of Fredric H. Gould, chairman of our board of trustees, Jeffrey A. Gould, our president and chief executive officer, and other members of senior management to carry out our business and investment strategies. Although Jeffrey A. Gould devotes substantially all of his business time to our affairs, he devotes a limited amount of his business time to entities affiliated with us. In addition to Jeffrey A. Gould, only three other executive officers, Mitchell Gould, our executive vice president, Lonnie Halpern, a vice president, and George Zweier, our vice president and chief financial officer, devote substantially all of their business time to us. The remainder of our executive management personnel share their services on a part-time basis with entities affiliated with us and located in the same executive offices pursuant to a shared services agreement. We rely on part-time executive officers to provide certain services to us, including legal, accounting and computer services, since we do not employ full-time executive officers to handle these services. If the shared services agreement is terminated, we will have to obtain such services or hire employees to perform them. We may not be able to replace these services or hire such employees in a timely manner or on terms, including cost and level of expertise, that are as favorable as those we receive under the shared services agreement. In addition, in the future we may need to attract and retain qualified senior management and other key personnel, both on a full-time and part-time basis. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could impair our ability to carry out our business and our investment strategies. We do not carry key man life insurance on members of our senior management. Our transactions with affiliated entities involve conflicts of interest. Entities affiliated with us and with certain of our executive officers provide services to us and on our behalf and we intend to continue the relationships with such entities in the future. Although our policy is to obtain terms in transactions with affiliates that are at least as favorable as those that we would receive if the transactions were entered into with unaffiliated entities, these transactions raise the potential that we may not receive terms as favorable as those that we would receive if the transactions were entered into with unaffiliated entities. 21 Compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to maximize profits. In order to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things, our sources of income, the amounts we distribute to our shareholders and the ownership of securities. We may also be required to make distributions to shareholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Accordingly, compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of such issuer. In addition, no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer, other than a qualified REIT security. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we must dispose of the portion of our assets in excess of such amounts within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our REIT status and suffering adverse tax consequences. This requirement could cause us to dispose of assets for consideration of less than their true value and could lead to a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
