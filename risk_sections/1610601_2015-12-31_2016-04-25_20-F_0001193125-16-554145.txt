D. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Doing Business in ChinaPRC regulation of loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may restrict or prevent us from using offshore funds to make loans to our PRC subsidiary and consolidated affiliated entity and its subsidiaries, or to make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary. As a result, there is uncertainty with respect to our ability to provide prompt financial support to our PRC subsidiary and consolidated affiliated entity when needed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our PRC subsidiary may use its own retained earnings (rather than RMB converted from foreign currency denominated capital) to provide financial support to our consolidated affiliated entity either through entrustment loans from our PRC subsidiary to our consolidated affiliated entity or direct loans to such consolidated affiliated entitys nominee shareholders, which would be contributed to the consolidated variable entity as capital injections. Such direct loans to the nominee shareholders would be eliminated in our consolidated financial statements against the consolidated affiliated entitys share capital. Our full-time employees in the PRC participate in a government-mandated contribution plan pursuant to which certain pension benefits, medical care, unemployment insurance, employee housing fund and other welfare benefits are provided to such employees. We accrue for these benefits based on certain percentages of the employees salaries. The total provisions for such employee benefits were US$1.0 million, US$2.6 million and US$6.5 million in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. We expect our contribution towards such employee benefits to increase in the future as we continue to expand our workforce and as salary levels of our employees continue to increase. The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2013 2014 2015 (in US$ thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (5,135 ) (5,933 ) 57,252 Net cash used in investing activities (3,181 ) (9,549 ) (333,380 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 45,000 412,256 (2,233 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 151 (1,180 ) (3,138 ) Net increase in (decrease by) cash and cash equivalents 36,835 395,594 (281,499 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 18,539 55,374 450,968 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 55,374 450,968 169,469 74 Table of Contents Anticipated Use of Cash We intend to invest in our research and development capabilities to grow our user base and enhance user experience.

Holding Company Structure Our company is a holding company with no material operations of its own. We conduct our operations primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entity and its subsidiaries in China. As a result, our ability to pay dividends depends upon dividends paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries. If our wholly owned subsidiaries or any newly formed subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us. In addition, our wholly owned subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends to us only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC law, each of our wholly owned PRC subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entity is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. As a result of these PRC laws and regulations, the capital and statutory reserves restricted which represented the amount of net assets of our relevant subsidiaries in PRC not available for distribution were US$91.0 million as of December 31, 2015. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures amounted to US$3.2 million, US$8.7 million and US$13.5 million in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. In the past, our capital expenditures were principally incurred to purchase servers, computers and other office equipment, and to pay for leasehold improvements for our offices. As our business expands, we may purchase new servers, computers and other equipment in the future, as well as make leasehold improvements. 76 Table of Contents C.

The following paragraphs summarize the principal terms of the 2012 Plan. Plan Administration. Our board of directors or one or more committees consisting solely of directors designated by our board will administer the 2012 Plan. The committee or the full board of directors, as applicable, will determine the participants to receive awards, the type and number of awards to be granted to each participant, and the terms and conditions of each grant. The board or such committee(s) may also delegate, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, to one or more officers of our company, its powers under the 2012 Plan to determine the officers and employees who will receive awards, the number of such awards, and the terms and conditions thereof. Subject to the limitations under the 2012 Plan, the plan administrator from time to time may authorize, generally or in specific cases only, for the benefit of any participant, any adjustment in exercise or purchase price, vesting schedule, and regranting of awards by waiver or by other legally valid means. Award Agreement. Awards granted under the 2012 Plan are evidenced by an award agreement that sets forth terms, provisions and restrictions for each award, which may include the type of award, the term of the award, vesting provisions, the exercise or purchase price, and the provisions applicable in the event that the recipients employment or service terminates. Under the plan, each recipient of option award shall duly sign a power of attorney delegating the voting rights and signing rights of ordinary shares issued upon the exercise of the option award. Eligibility. We may grant awards to our officers, directors, employees, consultants and advisors of our company. Acceleration of Awards upon Change in Control. If a change in control of our company occurs, the plan administrator may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the awards so that they may immediately vest without any forfeiture restrictions, unless the plan administrator has otherwise provided for substitution, assumption, exchange or other continuation or settlement of the award. Vesting Schedule. In general, the plan administrator determines the vesting schedule, which is specified in the relevant award agreement. Exercise of Options. The plan administrator determines the exercise price for each option award, which is stated in the award agreement and shall in no case be lower than the par value of our ordinary shares. Once vested, an option award will remain exercisable until the date of expiration or termination, unless otherwise provided by the plan administrator. However, each option award shall expire no more than 10 years after its date of grant. Transfer Restrictions. Awards may not be transferred in any manner by the recipient, save for certain exceptions including transfers to our company, transfers by gift to an affiliate or an immediately family member, transfer by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and other exceptions provided for by the plan administrator. Amendment and Termination of the 2012 Plan. Subject to any shareholder approval, our board of directors may, at any time, terminate or, from time to time, amend, modify or suspend this 2012 Plan. Unless terminated earlier, the 2012 Plan will terminate at the close of business on October 31, 2022. 81 Table of Contents 2014 Plan We adopted the 2014 share incentive plan, or the 2014 Plan, in November 2014.

Our board or a committee of one or more members of our board duly authorized for the purpose of the 2014 Plan can act as the plan administrator. Award Agreement. Options, restricted shares or restricted share units granted under the 2014 Plan are evidenced by an award agreement that sets forth the terms, conditions and limitations for each grant. Eligibility. We may grant awards to our employees, directors, consultants, or other individuals as determined, authorized and approved by the plan administrator. However, we may grant options that are intended to qualify as incentive share options only to our employees and employees of our parent companies and subsidiaries. Acceleration of Awards upon Change in Control. If a change in control, liquidation or dissolution of our company occurs, the plan administrator may, in its sole discretion, provide for (i) all awards outstanding to terminate at a specific time in the future and give each participant the right to exercise the vested portion of such awards during a specific period of time, or (ii) the purchase of any award for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have been attained upon the exercise of such award, or (iii) the replacement of such award with other rights or property selected by the plan administrator in its sole discretion, or (iv) payment of award in cash based on the value of Class A ordinary shares on the date of the change-in-control transaction plus reasonable interest. Exercise of Options. The plan administrator determines the exercise price for each award, which is stated in the award agreement. The vested portion of option will expire if not exercised prior to the tenth anniversary after the date of a grant, unless extended by the plan administrator. Exercise Price of Options. The exercise price in respect of any option shall be determined by the plan administrator and set forth in the award agreement which may be a fixed or variable price related to the fair market value of the shares. The exercise price per share subject to an option may be amended or adjusted in the absolute discretion of the plan administrator, the determination of which shall be final, binding and conclusive. Vesting Schedule. In general, the plan administrator determines the vesting schedule, which is set forth in the award agreement. Transfer Restrictions. Awards may not be transferred in any manner by the recipient other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, except as otherwise provided by the plan administrator. Termination. Unless terminated earlier, the 2014 Plan will terminate automatically in 2024. 82 Table of Contents The following table summarizes, as of March 31, 2016, the outstanding options under the 2012 Plan and 2014 Plan to certain officers, directors, employees and consultants.

BVI Plan In January 2015, Momo Technology Overseas Holding Company Limited, or Momo BVI, our wholly owned BVI subsidiary, adopted a share incentive plan, or the BVI Plan. The maximum number of ordinary shares issuable pursuant to awards granted under the BVI Plan is 30,000,000. The BVI Plan is administered by the board of directors of Momo BVI or one or more committees thereof, which shall determine the participants to receive awards, the type and number of awards to be granted to each participant, and the terms and conditions of each grant. Under the BVI Plan, Momo BVI may grant options, restricted shares or unrestricted ordinary shares to directors of Momo BVI, officers or employees of Momo BVI or its affiliates, or consultants to Momo BVI or its affiliates. In 2015, Momo BVI granted options to purchase a total of 5,550,000 and 5,000,000 of its shares to employees and an executive of Momo Information Technologies Corp., its wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Delaware, respectively, with exercise prices ranging from US$0.10 to US$0.11 per share for the awards granted to the employees and $0.11 per share for the award granted to the executive. Of such awards, options to purchase an aggregate of 9,600,000 shares remained outstanding as of March 31, 2016. 83 Table of Contents Employment Agreements and Indemnification Agreements We have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers. Under these agreements, each of our executive officers is employed for a specified time period. We may terminate employment for cause, at any time, without advance notice or remuneration, for certain acts of the executive officer, such as conviction or plea of guilty to a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude, negligent or dishonest acts to our detriment, or misconduct or a failure to perform agreed duties. We may also terminate an executive officers employment without cause upon three-month advance written notice. In such case of termination by us, we will provide severance payments to the executive officer as expressly required by applicable law of the jurisdiction where the executive officer is based. The executive officer may resign at any time with a three-month advance written notice. Each executive officer has agreed to hold, both during and after the termination or expiry of his or her employment agreement, in strict confidence and not to use, except as required in the performance of his or her duties in connection with the employment or pursuant to applicable law, any of our confidential information or trade secrets, any confidential information or trade secrets of our clients or prospective clients, or the confidential or proprietary information of any third party received by us and for which we have confidential obligations. The executive officers have also agreed to disclose in confidence to us all inventions, designs and trade secrets which they conceive, develop or reduce to practice during the executive officers employment with us and to assign all right, title and interest in them to us, and assist us in obtaining and enforcing patents, copyrights and other legal rights for these inventions, designs and trade secrets. In addition, each executive officer has agreed to be bound by non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions during the term of his or her employment and typically for one year following the last date of employment. Specifically, each executive officer has agreed not to (i) approach our suppliers, clients, customers or contacts or other persons or entities introduced to the executive officer in his or her capacity as a representative of us for the purpose of doing business with such persons or entities that will harm our business relationships with these persons or entities; (ii) assume employment with or provide services to any of our competitors, or engage, whether as principal, partner, licensor or otherwise, any of our competitors, without our express consent; or (iii) seek directly or indirectly, to solicit the services of any of our employees who is employed by us on or after the date of the executive officers termination, or in the year preceding such termination, without our express consent. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, we agree to indemnify our directors and executive officers against certain liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with claims made by reason of their being a director or officer of our company. C. Board Practices Board of Directors Our board of directors consists of nine directors. A director is not required to hold any shares in our company to qualify to serve as a director. A director who is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in a contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction with our company must declare the nature of his or her interest at a meeting of the directors. Subject to applicable NASDAQ Stock Market Rules and disqualification by the chairman of the relevant board meeting, a director may vote in respect of any contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction notwithstanding that he or she may be interested therein, and if he or she does so his or her vote shall be counted and he or she may be counted in the quorum at the relevant board meeting at which such contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction is considered. The directors may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and uncalled capital, and to issue debentures or other securities whenever money is borrowed or as security for any debt, liability or obligation of the company or of any third party. None of our non-executive directors has a service contract with us that provides for benefits upon termination of service. 84 Table of Contents Committees of the Board of Directors We have established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee under the board of directors. We have adopted a charter for each of the three committees. Each committees members and functions are described below. Audit Committee Our audit committee consists of Benson Bing Chung Tam, Dr. Dave Daqing Qi and Yong Li. Mr. Tam is the chairman of our audit committee. We have determined that each member satisfies the independence requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and that each of Mr. Tam and Dr. Qi qualifies as an audit committee financial expert. The audit committee oversees our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of the financial statements of our company. The audit committee is responsible for, among other things:  appointing the independent auditors and pre-approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be performed by the independent auditors;  reviewing with the independent auditors any audit problems or difficulties and managements response;  discussing the annual audited financial statements with management and the independent auditors;  reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our accounting and internal control policies and procedures and any steps taken to monitor and control major financial risk exposures;  reviewing and approving all proposed related party transactions;  meeting separately and periodically with management and the independent auditors; and  monitoring compliance with our code of business conduct and ethics, including reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our procedures to ensure proper compliance. Compensation Committee Our compensation committee consists of Yong Li, Benson Bing Chung Tam and Dr. Dave Daqing Qi. Mr. Li is the chairman of our compensation committee. We have determined that each member satisfies the independence requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules. The compensation committee assists the board in reviewing and approving the compensation structure, including all forms of compensation, relating to our directors and executive officers. Our chief executive officer may not be present at any committee meeting during which his compensation is deliberated. The compensation committee is responsible for, among other things:  reviewing and approving, or recommending to the board for its approval, the compensation for our chief executive officer and other executive officers;  reviewing and recommending to the board for determination with respect to the compensation of our non-employee directors;  reviewing periodically and approving any incentive compensation or equity plans, programs or similar arrangements; and  selecting compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser only after taking into consideration all factors relevant to that persons independence from management. 85 Table of Contents Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Our nominating and corporate governance committee consists of Yong Li, Benson Bing Chung Tam and Dr. Dave Daqing Qi. Mr. Li is the chairperson of our nominating and corporate governance committee. We have determined that each member satisfies the independence requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules. The nominating and corporate governance committee assists the board of directors in selecting individuals qualified to become our directors and in determining the composition of the board and its committees. The nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for, among other things:  selecting and recommending to the board nominees for election by the shareholders or appointment by the board;  reviewing annually with the board the current composition of the board with regards to characteristics such as independence, knowledge, skills, experience and diversity;  making recommendations on the frequency and structure of board meetings and monitoring the functioning of the committees of the board; and  advising the board periodically with regards to significant developments in the law and practice of corporate governance as well as our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and making recommendations to the board on all matters of corporate governance and on any remedial action to be taken. Duties of Directors Under Cayman Islands law, our directors have a fiduciary duty to act honestly, in good faith and with a view to our best interests. Our directors also owe to our company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands. In fulfilling their duty of care to us, our directors must ensure compliance with our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, and the class rights vested thereunder in the holders of the shares. Our company has the right to seek damages if a duty owed by our directors is breached. Our board of directors has all the powers necessary for managing, and for directing and supervising, our business affairs. The functions and powers of our board of directors include, among others:  convening shareholders annual general meetings and reporting its work to shareholders at such meetings;  declaring dividends and distributions;  appointing officers and determining the term of office of the officers;  exercising the borrowing powers of our company and mortgaging the property of our company; and  approving the transfer of shares in our company, including the registration of such shares in our share register. Terms of Directors and Executive Officers Our officers are elected by and serve at the discretion of the board of directors. Our directors are not subject to a term of office and hold office until such time as they are removed from office by ordinary resolution of the shareholders or by the unanimous written resolution of all the shareholders. A director will cease to be a director automatically if, among other things, the director (i) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors; (ii) dies or is found by our company to be or becomes of unsound mind; (iii) resigns his or her office by notice in writing to our company; (iv) without special leave of absence from our board of directors, is absent from meetings of our board of directors for three consecutive meetings and the board resolves that his or her office be vacated; or (v) is removed from office pursuant to any other provision of our memorandum and articles of association. 86 Table of Contents D.

These contract workers are primarily responsible for content management and monitoring and for customer service. As required by laws and regulations in China, we participate in various employee social security plans that are organized by municipal and provincial governments, including housing, pension, medical insurance and unemployment insurance. We are required under Chinese law to make contributions to employee benefit plans at specified percentages of the salaries, bonuses and certain allowances of our employees, up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time. We typically enter into standard confidentiality and employment agreements with our management and service development personnel. These contracts include a standard non-compete covenant that prohibits the employee from competing with us, directly or indirectly, during his or her employment and for two years after the termination of his or her employment, provided that we pay compensation equal to a certain percentage of the employees salary during the restriction period in accordance with applicable laws. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and we have not experienced any labor disputes. None of our employees are represented by labor unions. E. Share Ownership For information regarding the share ownership of our directors and officers, see Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party TransactionsA. Major Shareholders. For information as to stock options granted to our directors, executive officers and other employees, see Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesB. CompensationShare Incentive Plans. Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions A. Major Shareholders The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our shares as of March 31, 2016 by:  each of our current directors and executive officers; and  each person known to us to own beneficially more than 5% of our shares. Percentage of beneficial ownership is based on a total of 384,253,289 outstanding ordinary shares of our company as of the date of March 31, 2016, comprising (i) 287,366,919 Class A ordinary shares, excluding the 10,002,822 Class A ordinary shares issued to our depositary bank for bulk issuance of ADSs reserved for future issuances upon the exercise or vesting of awards granted under our share incentive plans, and (ii) 96,886,370 Class B ordinary shares. 87 Table of Contents Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These rules generally provide that a person is the beneficial owner of securities if such person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of securities, or to dispose or direct the disposition of securities or has the right to acquire such powers within 60 days. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we have included shares that the person has the right to acquire within 60 days, including through the exercise of any option, warrant or other right or the conversion of any other security, in both the numerator and the denominator. These shares, however, are not included in the computation of the percentage ownership of any other person.

The number of beneficial owners of our ADSs in the United States is likely to be much larger than the number of record holders of our ordinary shares in the United States. Our ordinary shares are divided into Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Holders of Class A ordinary shares are entitled to one vote per share, while holders of Class B ordinary shares are entitled to ten votes per share. We are not aware of any arrangement that may, at a subsequent date, result in a change of control of our company. None of our major shareholders have different voting rights apart from any Class B ordinary shares that they may hold in our company. B.
