Item 1A. Risk Factors.) Asset Impairment We perform an impairment analysis for the carrying amount of our properties in accordance with GAAP when indicators of impairment exist. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we reduced the carrying amount to fair value, and recorded in continuing and discontinued operations, non-cash impairment charges aggregating $13.9 million and $20.2 million, respectively, where the carrying amount of the property exceeded the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period and the estimated net sales value expected to be received at disposition. The non-cash impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2012 were attributable to reductions in estimated selling prices and increases in the carrying value for certain properties in conjunction with recording environmental remediation obligations and related environmental asset retirement costs. The non-cash impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2011 were attributable to recording the Marketing Environmental Liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2011, reductions in real estate valuations and reductions in the assumed holding period used to test for impairment and reductions in estimated selling prices. Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures We manage our business to enhance the value of our real estate portfolio and, as a REIT, place particular emphasis on minimizing risk and generating cash sufficient to make required distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income each year. In addition to measurements defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), our management also focuses on funds from operations available to common shareholders (FFO) and adjusted funds from operations available to common shareholders (AFFO) to measure our performance. FFO is generally considered to be an appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measure of the performance of REITs. In accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts modified guidance for reporting FFO, we have restated reporting of FFO for all periods presented to exclude non-cash impairment charges. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts as net earnings before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains or losses on dispositions of real estate (including such non-FFO items reported in discontinued operations), non-cash impairment charges, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting change. Other REITs may use definitions of FFO and/or AFFO that are different than ours and; accordingly, may not be comparable. We believe that FFO and AFFO are helpful to investors in measuring our performance because both FFO and AFFO exclude various items included in GAAP net earnings that do not relate to, or are not indicative of, our fundamental operating performance. FFO excludes various items such as gains or losses from property dispositions and depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and non-cash impairment charges. In our case; however, GAAP net earnings and FFO typically include the impact of the Revenue Recognition Adjustments comprised of deferred rental revenue (straight-line rental revenue), the net amortization of above-market and below-market leases and income recognized from direct financing leases on our recognition of revenues from rental properties, as offset by the impact of related collection reserves. GAAP net earnings and FFO from time to time may also include property acquisition costs or other unusual or infrequently recurring items. Deferred rental revenue results primarily from fixed rental increases scheduled under certain leases with our tenants. In accordance with GAAP, the aggregate minimum rent due over the current term of these leases are recognized on a straight-line (or average) basis rather than when payment is contractually due. The present value of the difference between the fair market rent and the contractual rent for in-place leases at the time properties are acquired is amortized into revenue from rental properties over the remaining lives of the in-place leases. Income from direct financing leases is recognized over the lease terms using the effective interest method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties. Property acquisition costs are expensed, generally in the period when properties are acquired, and are not reflective of normal operations. Other unusual or infrequently occurring items are not reflective of normal operations. Management pays particular attention to AFFO, a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure that we define as FFO less Revenue Recognition Adjustments, property acquisition costs and other unusual or infrequently occurring items. In managements view, AFFO provides a more accurate depiction than FFO of our fundamental operating performance related to: (i) the impact of scheduled rent increases from operating leases, net of related collection reserves; (ii) the rental revenue earned from acquired in-place leases; (iii) the impact of rent due from direct financing leases; (iv) our operating expenses (exclusive of direct expensed operating property acquisition costs); and (v) other unusual or infrequently occurring items. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent cash generated from operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP and therefore these measures should not be considered an alternative for GAAP net earnings or as a measure of liquidity. For a reconciliation of FFO and AFFO, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data. 30 Table of Contents 2012, 2011 and 2010 Acquisitions In 2012, we acquired fee or leasehold title to five gasoline station and convenience store properties in separate transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $5.2 million. On January 13, 2011, we acquired fee or leasehold title to 59 Mobil-branded gasoline station and convenience store properties and also took a security interest in six other Mobil-branded gasoline stations and convenience store properties in a sale/leaseback and loan transaction with CPD NY Energy Corp. (CPD NY), a subsidiary of Chestnut Petroleum Dist. Inc. Our total investment in the transaction was $111.6 million including acquisition costs, which was financed entirely with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The properties were acquired or financed in a simultaneous transaction among ExxonMobil, CPD NY and us whereby CPD NY acquired a portfolio of 65 gasoline station and convenience stores from ExxonMobil and simultaneously completed a sale/leaseback of 59 of the acquired properties and leasehold interests with us. The lease between us, as lessor, and CPD NY, as lessee, governing the properties is a unitary triple-net lease agreement (the CPD Lease), with an initial term of 15 years, and options for up to three successive renewal terms of ten years each. The CPD Lease requires CPD NY to pay a fixed annual rent for the properties (the Rent), plus an amount equal to all rent due to third party landlords pursuant to the terms of third party leases. The Rent is scheduled to increase on the third anniversary of the date of the CPD Lease and on every third anniversary thereafter. As a triple-net lessee, CPD NY is required to pay all amounts pertaining to the properties subject to the CPD Lease, including taxes, assessments, licenses and permit fees, charges for public utilities and all governmental charges. Partial funding to CPD NY for the transaction was also provided by us under a secured, self-amortizing loan having a 10-year term (the CPD Loan). On March 31, 2011, we acquired fee or leasehold title to 66 Shell-branded gasoline station and convenience store properties in a sale/leaseback transaction with Nouria Energy Ventures I, LLC (Nouria), a subsidiary of Nouria Energy Group. Our total investment in the transaction was $87.0 million including acquisition costs, which was financed entirely with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The properties were acquired in a simultaneous transaction among Motiva Enterprises LLC (Shell), Nouria and us whereby Nouria acquired a portfolio of 66 gasoline station and convenience stores from Shell and simultaneously completed a sale/leaseback of the 66 acquired properties and leasehold interests with us. The lease between us, as lessor, and Nouria, as lessee, governing the properties is a unitary triple-net lease agreement (the Nouria Lease), with an initial term of 20 years, and options for up to two successive renewal terms of ten years each followed by one final renewal term of five years. The Nouria Lease requires Nouria to pay a fixed annual rent for the properties (the Rent), plus an amount equal to all rent due to third party landlords pursuant to the terms of third party leases. The Rent is scheduled to increase on every annual anniversary of the date of the Nouria Lease. As a triple-net lessee, Nouria is required to pay all amounts pertaining to the properties subject to the Nouria Lease, including taxes, assessments, licenses and permit fees, charges for public utilities and all governmental charges. In 2010, we purchased three gasoline station and convenience store properties in separate transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $3.6 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011 Revenues from rental properties included in continuing operations decreased by $1.0 million to $99.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to $100.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Revenues from rental properties include approximately $73.0 million and $45.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, in rent contractually due or received from tenants other than Marketing including rent for May 2012 through December 2012 related to properties repositioned from the Master Lease. Revenues from rental properties included in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 include approximately $20.1 million and, for the year ended December 31, 2011, $52.6 million in rent contractually due or received from Marketing under the Master Lease (for which bad debt reserves of $11.5 million and $7.3 million were provided and are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively). The decrease in revenues from rental properties for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily due to the fact that we are generating less net revenue from the leasing of properties that were previously subject to the Master Lease than the contractual rent historically due from Marketing under the Master Lease. The decrease in revenues from rental properties was partially offset by rental income from properties we acquired from, and leased back to, Nouria Energy Ventures I, LLC (Nouria) in March 2011 and an increase in the real estate taxes we paid and billed to Marketing through April 30, 2012, the date the Master Lease was rejected, and from other tenants pursuant to triple-net leases thereafter. As a result of Marketings bankruptcy filing, beginning in the first quarter of 2012, we began paying past due real estate taxes for 2011 and 2012, which taxes Marketing historically paid directly. Revenues from rental properties and rental property expense included $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 for real estate taxes paid by us which were due 31 Table of Contents from Marketing through the date the Master Lease was rejected as well as from other tenants who are contractually obligated to reimburse us for the payment of real estate taxes pursuant to the terms of triple-net lease agreements. The decrease in rent contractually due or received from Marketing and other tenants for the year ended December 31, 2012 was also due, to a lesser extent, the effect of dispositions and lease expirations partially offset by rent escalations. In accordance with GAAP, we recognize rental revenue in amounts which vary from the amount of rent contractually due or received during the periods presented. As a result, revenues from rental properties include Revenue Recognition Adjustments comprised of non-cash adjustments recorded for deferred rental revenue due to the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the current lease term, net amortization of above-market and below-market leases and recognition of rental income under direct financing leases using the effective interest rate method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties. Rental revenue includes Revenue Recognition Adjustments which increased rental revenue by $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Interest income from notes and mortgages receivable increased by $0.2 million to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $2.7 million the year ended December 31, 2011 due to the issuance of $4.6 million of mortgage notes in connection with 2012 property dispositions. Rental property expenses included in continuing operations, which are primarily comprised of rent expense and real estate and other state and local taxes, were $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in rental property expenses is principally due to additional maintenance expense and real estate tax expenses paid by us and reimbursable by our tenants related to properties and leasehold interests acquired in 2011 and real estate taxes historically paid by Marketing directly, which taxes we began paying in the first quarter of 2012. The reimbursement of real estate taxes from our tenants is included in revenues from rental properties in our consolidated statement of operations. We provide bad debt reserves for the taxes reimbursable from Marketing since do not expect to receive payment of taxes from the Marketing Estate. Non-cash impairment charges of $6.3 million are included in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $15.9 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011. Impairment charges are incurred when the carrying value of a property is reduced to fair value. The non-cash impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2012 were attributable to reductions in estimated selling prices and increases in the carrying value for certain properties in conjunction with recording environmental remediation obligations and related environmental asset retirement costs. The non-cash impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2011 were attributable to recording the Marketing Environmental Liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2011, reductions in real estate valuations and reductions in the assumed holding period used to test for impairment and reductions in estimated selling prices. Environmental expenses included in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by $4.8 million, to $0.8 million, as compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease in environmental expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 was due to a lower provision for litigation loss reserves and legal fees, which decreased by $2.6 million for 2012, and a lower provision for estimated environmental remediation obligations, which decreased by an aggregate $2.6 million to a credit of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in professional fees. Environmental expenses vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of change in reported environmental expenses for one period as compared to prior periods. General and administrative expenses included in continuing operations increased by $7.0 million to $29.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $22.1 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in general and administrative expenses was principally due to an increase of $5.9 million of reserve for bad debts primarily attributable to nonpayment of rent and real estate taxes due from Marketing that we do not expect to collect, $2.6 million of legal and professional fees incurred related to Marketings defaults of its obligations under the Master Lease and bankruptcy filing, higher employee related expenses recorded in the year ended December 31, 2012, partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in property acquisition costs. As a result of Marketings material monetary default under the Master Lease and Marketings bankruptcy filing, in 2011 we concluded that it was probable that we would not receive the contractual lease payments when due from Marketing for the entire initial term of the Master Lease. Therefore, during 2011, we increased our reserve by recording additional non-cash allowances for deferred rent receivable, of which $19.3 million is included in continuing operations. These non-cash allowances reduced our net earnings and funds from operations for the year ended December 31, 2011, but did not impact our cash flow from operating activities or adjusted funds from operations since the impact of the straight line method of accounting is not included in our determination of adjusted funds from operations. Depreciation and amortization expense included in continuing operations for 2012 was $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to depreciation charges related to asset retirement costs and properties acquired, partially offset by the effect of certain assets becoming fully depreciated, lease terminations and dispositions of real estate. 32 Table of Contents As a result, total operating expenses decreased by approximately $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Other income, net, included in income from continuing operations was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to $0.016 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Interest expense was $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was due to an increase in the weighted-average interest rate on borrowings outstanding, loan origination costs incurred in March 2012 amortized over the one year extension of our debt agreements, and higher average borrowings outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, partially offset by the expiration of the Swap Agreement on June 30, 2011. As a result, earnings from continuing operations were $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and net earnings decreased by $0.1 million to $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. We report as discontinued operations the results of approximately 111 properties accounted for as held for sale as of the end of the current period and certain properties disposed of during the periods presented. The operating results and gains from certain dispositions of real estate sold in 2012 have been classified as discontinued operations. The operating results of such properties for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 have also been reclassified to discontinued operations to conform to the 2012 presentation. Earnings from discontinued operations decreased by $4.4 million to a loss of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to earnings of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower rental revenue and higher operating costs, including higher impairment charges, partially offset by higher gains on dispositions of real estate. Gains from dispositions of real estate included in discontinued operations were $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2012, there were 54 property dispositions. For the year ended December 31, 2011, there were 10 property dispositions. Gains on disposition of real estate and impairment charges vary from period to period and accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the directions of change in reported gains and impairment charges for one period as compared to prior periods. For the year ended December 31, 2012, FFO decreased by $8.9 million to $33.2 million, as compared to $42.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, and AFFO decreased by $33.9 million to $28.8 million, as compared to $62.7 million for the prior year. The decrease in FFO for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily due to the changes in net earnings but exclude a $6.3 million decrease in impairment charges, a $3.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a $5.9 million increase in gains on dispositions of real estate. The decrease in AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2012 also exclude a $19.8 million decrease in the allowance for deferred rental revenue, a $2.0 million decrease in acquisition costs and a $3.2 million increase in Rental Revenue Adjustments which cause our reported revenues from rental properties to vary from the amount of rent payments contractually due or received by us during the periods presented (which are included in net earnings and FFO but are excluded from AFFO). Diluted earnings per share was $0.37 per share for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Diluted FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $0.99 per share, as compared to $1.26 per share for the year ended December 31, 2011. Diluted AFFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $0.86 per share, as compared to $1.88 per share for the year ended December 31, 2011. Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010 Revenues from rental properties included in continuing operations were $100.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $78.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Revenues from rental properties include approximately $52.6 million and $50.1 million in rent contractually due or received for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, from properties leased to Marketing under the Master Lease and approximately $45.5 million and $26.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, contractually due or received from other tenants. The increase in rent contractually due or received from other tenants for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to rental income from properties we acquired from, and leased back to, CPD NY in January 2011 and Nouria in March 2011. The increase in the rent contractually due or received from Marketing for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to an increase in the real estate taxes we pay (or accrue) and bill to Marketing. As a result of Marketings bankruptcy filing, beginning in the first quarter of 2012, we began paying past due real estate taxes for 2011 and 2012, which taxes Marketing historically paid directly. Revenues from rental properties and rental property expense included $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 for real estate taxes paid (or accrued) by us which were due from Marketing as well as from other 33 Table of Contents tenants who are contractually obligated to reimburse us for the payment of real estate taxes pursuant to the terms of triple-net lease agreements. In accordance with GAAP, we recognize rental revenue in amounts which vary from the amount of rent contractually due or received during the periods presented. As a result, revenues from rental properties include Revenue Recognition Adjustments comprised of non-cash adjustments recorded for deferred rental revenue due to the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the current lease term, net amortization of above-market and below-market leases and recognition of rental income under direct financing leases using the effective interest rate method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties. Rental revenue includes Revenue Recognition Adjustments which increased rental revenue by $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Interest income from notes and mortgages receivable increased by $2.6 million to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to the issuance of $30.4 million of notes receivable substantially all in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2011. Rental property expenses included in continuing operations, which are primarily comprised of rent expense and real estate and other state and local taxes, were $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in rental property expenses is principally due to additional real estate tax and rent expenses paid by us and reimbursable by our tenants related to properties and leasehold interests acquired in 2011 and accrued past due real estate taxes historically paid by Marketing directly, which taxes we began paying in the first quarter of 2012. The reimbursement of such expenses from our tenants is included in revenues from rental properties in our consolidated statement of operations. We provided a bad debt reserve for the taxes reimbursable from Marketing since do not expect to receive payment of taxes from the Marketing Estate. Non-cash impairment charges of $15.9 million are included in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to no impairment charges recorded for the year ended December 31, 2010. The non-cash impairment charges related to the properties leased to Marketing were primarily attributable to significant increases in the carrying value for certain of the properties in conjunction with recording the Marketing Environmental Liabilities. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we accrued $47.9 million as the aggregate Marketing Environmental Liabilities since we could no longer assume that Marketing will be able to meet its environmental remediation obligations and its obligations to remove underground storage tanks at the end of their useful life. In accordance with GAAP, we increased the carrying value for each of the affected properties by the amount of the related estimated environmental obligation which resulted in simultaneously recording impairment charges in continuing operations and discontinued operations aggregating $17.0 million where the increased carrying value of the property exceeded its estimated fair value. The non-cash impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted from reductions in real estate valuations and the reductions in the assumed holding period used to test for impairment. Environmental expenses included in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $0.2 million, to $5.6 million, as compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net environmental expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to a higher provision for litigation loss reserves and legal fees which increased by $0.6 million for 2011, partially offset by a lower provision for estimated environmental remediation obligations which decreased by an aggregate $0.4 million to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Environmental expenses vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of change in reported environmental expenses for one period as compared to prior periods. General and administrative expenses included in continuing operations were $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $8.2 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in general and administrative expenses was principally due to $7.6 million of reserve for bad debts primarily attributable to nonpayment of pre-petition rent and real estate taxes due from Marketing that we do not expect to collect, $2.0 million of property acquisition costs, $1.5 million of legal and professional fees incurred related to Marketings defaults of its obligations under the Master Lease and bankruptcy filing and higher employee related expenses and legal fees recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011. As a result of Marketings material monetary default under the Master Lease and Marketings bankruptcy filing, we previously concluded that it was probable that we would not receive the contractual lease payments when due from Marketing for the entire initial term of the Master Lease. Therefore, during 2011, we increased our reserve by recording additional non-cash allowances for deferred rent receivable of $19.3 million. These non-cash allowances reduced our net earnings and funds from operations for the year ended December 31, 2011, but did not impact our cash flow from operating activities or adjusted funds from operations since the impact of the straight line method of accounting is not included in our determination of adjusted funds from operations. Depreciation and amortization expense included in continuing operations was $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to depreciation charges related to asset retirement costs and properties acquired, partially offset by the effect of certain assets becoming fully depreciated, lease terminations and dispositions of real estate. 34 Table of Contents As a result, total operating expenses increased by approximately $55.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Other income, net, included in income from continuing operations was $0.016 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Interest expense was $5.1 million for each of 2011 and 2010. While there was no significant change in interest expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the prior year period, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding decreased due to changes in the relative amounts of debt outstanding under our borrowing agreements and average borrowings outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2011 were higher than average borrowings outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2010. The average borrowings outstanding in 2011 were impacted by, among other things, $113.0 million drawn under a revolving credit facility to finance the transaction with CPD NY, $92.1 million drawn under a revolving credit facility to finance the transaction with Nouria and the repayment of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility with substantially all of the net proceeds of $92.0 million received in 2011 from a 3.45 million share common stock offering. As a result, earnings from continuing operations decreased by $31.5 million to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $40.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and net earnings decreased by $39.2 million to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The operating results and gains from certain dispositions of real estate sold in 2012 have been classified as discontinued operations. The operating results of such properties for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 have also been reclassified to discontinued operations to conform to the 2012 presentation. Earnings from discontinued operations decreased by $7.8 million to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from operating activities and lower gains on dispositions of real estate. Gains from dispositions of real estate included in discontinued operations were $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, there were 10 property dispositions. For the year ended December 31, 2010, there were six property dispositions. Other income, net and gains on disposition of real estate vary from period to period and accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the directions of change in reported gains for one period as compared to prior periods. For the year ended December 31, 2011, FFO decreased by $17.6 million to $42.1 million, as compared to $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and AFFO increased by $4.5 million to $62.7 million, as compared to $58.2 million for the prior year. The decrease in FFO for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the changes in net earnings but excludes a $20.2 million increase in impairment charges, a $0.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a $0.7 million decrease in gains on dispositions of real estate. The increase in AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2011 also excludes a $19.8 million increase in the allowance for deferred rental revenue, a $2.0 million increase in acquisition costs and a $0.3 million decrease in Rental Revenue Adjustments which cause our reported revenues from rental properties to vary from the amount of rent payments contractually due or received by us during the periods presented (which are included in net earnings and FFO but are excluded from AFFO). The calculations of net earnings per share, FFO per share, and AFFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2011 were impacted by an increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding as a result of the issuance of shares of common stock in 2010 and 2011. The weighted average number of shares outstanding in our per share calculations increased by 5.2 million shares, or 18.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the prior year period. Accordingly, the percentage or direction of the changes in net earnings, FFO and AFFO discussed above may differ from the changes in the related per share amounts.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows from our operations, funds available under our Credit Agreement that matures in August 2015 (described below) and available cash and cash equivalents. Management believes that our operating cash needs for the next twelve months can be met by cash flows from operations, borrowings under our Credit Agreement and available cash and cash equivalents. Net cash flow provided by operating activities reported on our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $15.9 million, $60.8 million and $57.1 million, respectively. Our business operations and liquidity is dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from our properties. 35 Table of Contents Debt Refinancing As of December 31, 2012, we were a party to a $175 million amended and restated senior secured revolving credit agreement with a group of commercial banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and a $25 million amended term loan agreement with TD Bank, both of which were scheduled to mature in March 2013. As of December 31, 2012, borrowings under the credit agreement were $150.3 million bearing interest at a rate of 3.25% per annum and borrowings under the term loan agreement were $22.0 million bearing interest at a rate of 3.50% per annum. On February 25, 2013, the borrowings then outstanding under such credit agreement and term loan agreement were repaid with cash on hand and proceeds of the Credit Agreement and the Prudential Loan Agreement (both defined below). Credit Agreement On February 25, 2013, we entered into a $175 million senior secured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a group of commercial banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Bank Syndicate), which is scheduled to mature in August 2015. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we have the option to extend the term of the Credit Agreement for one additional year to August 2016. The Credit Agreement allocates $25 million of the total Bank Syndicate commitment to a term loan and $150 million to a revolving credit facility. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we have the option to increase by $50 million the amount of the revolving credit facility to $200 million. The Credit Agreement permits borrowings at an interest rate equal to the sum of a base rate plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.00% or a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.50% to 3.00% based on our leverage at the end of each quarterly reporting period. The annual commitment fee on the undrawn funds under the Credit Agreement is 0.30% to 0.40% based our leverage at the end of each quarterly reporting period. The Credit Agreement does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance prior to its maturity. The Credit Agreement provides for security in the form of, among other items, mortgage liens on certain of our properties. The parties to the Credit Agreement and the Prudential Loan Agreement (as defined below) share the security pursuant to the terms of an inter-creditor agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary financial covenants such as loan to value, leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including default under the Prudential Loan Agreement, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status. Any event of default, if not cured or waived, would increase by 200 basis points (2.00%) the interest rate we pay under the Credit Agreement and prohibit us from drawing funds against the Credit Agreement and could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness under the Credit Agreement and could also give rise to an event of default and could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness under the Prudential Loan Agreement. We may be prohibited from drawing funds against the revolving credit facility if there is a material adverse effect on our business, assets, prospects or condition. Prudential Loan Agreement On February 25, 2013, we entered into a $100 million senior secured long-term loan agreement with the Prudential Insurance Company of America (the Prudential Loan Agreement), which matures in February 2021. The Prudential Loan Agreement bears interest at 6.00%. The Prudential Loan Agreement does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance prior to its maturity. The parties to the Credit Agreement and the Prudential Loan Agreement share the security described above pursuant to the terms of an inter-creditor agreement. The Prudential Loan Agreement contains customary financial covenants such as loan to value, leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. The Prudential Loan Agreement contains customary events of default, including default under the Credit Agreement and failure to maintain REIT status. Any event of default, if not cured or waived, would increase by 200 basis points (2.00%) the interest rate we pay under the Prudential Loan Agreement and could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness under the Prudential Loan Agreement and could also give rise to an event of default and could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness under our Credit Agreement. Property Acquisitions and Capital Expenditures Since we generally lease our properties on a triple-net basis, we have not historically incurred significant capital expenditures other than those related to acquisitions. As part of our overall business strategy, we regularly review opportunities to acquire additional properties and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions that we believe will benefit our financial performance. Our property acquisitions and capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 amounted to $4.1 million, $167.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively, substantially all of which was for acquisitions. We are evaluating potential capital expenditures for properties that were previously subject to the Master Lease with Marketing and which are not currently subject to long-term leases. We have no current plans to make material improvements to any of our properties other than the properties previously subject to the Master Lease with Marketing. However, our tenants frequently make improvements to the properties leased from us at their expense. In certain of our new leases, we have committed to co-invest as much as $14.1 million in capital improvements in our properties.
