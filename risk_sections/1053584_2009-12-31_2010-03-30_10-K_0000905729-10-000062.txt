PART I ITEM 1: Business. As used in this report, the terms "we," "us," "our," the "Company" and "Macatawa" mean Macatawa Bank Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning. The term "Bank" means Macatawa Bank. Overview Macatawa Bank Corporation is a Michigan corporation and a registered bank holding company. Macatawa's business is concentrated in a single industry segment - commercial banking. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Macatawa Bank, Macatawa offers a full range of commercial and personal banking services, including checking, savings and certificates of deposit accounts, cash management, safe deposit boxes, travelers checks, money orders, trust services and commercial, mortgage and consumer loans through its twenty-six branch offices and a lending and operation service facility in Kent County, Ottawa County, and northern Allegan County, Michigan. Other services we offer include ATMs, internet banking, telephone banking and debit cards. Macatawa Bank provides various brokerage services, including discount brokerage through Infinex, personal financial planning and consultation regarding mutual funds. At December 31, 2009, Macatawa had total assets of $1.83 billion, total deposits of $1.42 billion, approximately 102,000 deposit accounts and shareholders' equity of $88.0 million. During 2008 and 2009, Macatawa reported operating losses of $38.9 million and $63.6 million, respectively. The losses for 2008 and 2009 were largely attributable to loan losses, lost interest on non-performing assets and rising costs of administering problem assets associated with the rapid increase in problem loans and other real estate assets. The results for 2009 also included a non-cash charge of $18.0 million included in federal income tax expense associated with a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and the results for 2008 included non-cash, after tax impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets of $27 million. There will be no further affect on the Company's results of operations associated with deferred tax assets or goodwill, as these assets have been written off in their entirety. As of the date of this report, the Bank was categorized as "adequately capitalized" under applicable regulatory guidelines. Additional information about the consolidated financial condition of Macatawa as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the results of its operations for the three years ended December 31, 2009, may be found throughout this report, including in Item 7 of this report in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Item 8 of this report in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, and such information is here incorporated by reference.

Recent Business Developments As a result of our losses, the Board of Directors of Macatawa has significantly changed the strategic direction and focus of the Bank to improve its internal operations and to work out of its problem loans and assets. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Macatawa Board of Directors elected a new Chairman of the Board. Macatawa has since worked closely with its regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") and Macatawa Bank's regulators at the FDIC and the Michigan Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation ("OFIR") to put in place improved controls and procedures. The Macatawa Bank Board of Directors has implemented additional corporate governance practices and disciplined business and banking principles, including more conservative lending principles that comply with regulatory standards, and appointed experienced and disciplined lending and compliance personnel. The focus of our management team has turned from growth in our business to executing these disciplined business and banking procedures and policies designed to limit future losses, preserve capital and improve operational efficiencies. These steps have already resulted in the removal of approximately $9 million from the Company's annualized operating costs. Consent Order with Macatawa Bank and its Regulators On February 22, 2010, Macatawa Bank entered into a Consent Order with the FDIC and OFIR, the primary banking regulators of the Bank. The Consent Order is the result of ongoing discussions between regulators and Macatawa Bank based on a - - 3 - regulatory examination conducted in summer 2009. The Bank agreed to the terms of the negotiated Consent Order without admitting or denying any charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices. The Consent Order imposes no fines or penalties on the Bank. The Consent Order will remain in effect and enforceable until it is modified, terminated, suspended, or set aside by the FDIC and OFIR. Macatawa Bank's customer deposits remain fully insured to the highest limit set by the FDIC. The Board of Directors views the requirements of the Consent Order as necessary components of its efforts to return Macatawa to profitability and pursue the long term success of Macatawa Bank for its shareholders, depositors, and customers. The following is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Consent Order, which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Macatawa's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2010, and here incorporated by reference. The Consent Order, among other requirements, includes the following:  The Consent Order requires the Bank, within 90 days, to have and maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of at least 8% and a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio of at least 11%.  The Consent Order requires the Bank to charge off all assets or portions of assets classified "Loss" in the most recent FDIC Report of Examination ("ROE") that have not been previously collected or charged off. This was accomplished subsequent to the examination in October, 2009.  The Consent Order prohibits the Bank from extending additional credit to, or for the benefit of, any borrower who is already obligated to the Bank on any loan that has been charged off by the Bank, so long as the amount charged off remains uncollected. In addition, the Consent Order prohibits the Bank from extending any additional credit to a borrower who has an uncollected loan that has been classified "Substandard" or "Doubtful", unless the Bank's Board of Directors has determined that extending additional credit to the borrower is in the best interest of the Bank.  The Consent Order requires the Board of Directors of the Bank upon the issuance of the order and before each quarterly Report of Condition and Income to review the adequacy of the Bank's Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses ("ALLL") and make adjustments needed to provide for an adequate ALLL.  While the Consent Order is in effect, the Bank may not declare or pay any cash dividend without the prior written consent of the FDIC and the OFIR. The Bank did not pay dividends to the Company during 2009. In previous periods, dividends from the Bank to the Company were primarily utilized by the Company to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and interest on its trust preferred securities. The Company has suspended payment of dividends on common and preferred stock and has deferred interest payments on trust preferred securities. The Consent Order also requires the Bank and its Board of Directors to adopt and implement a variety of policies, plans, procedures and practices intended to aid in the safe and sound conduct of the Bank's business. Other requirements of the Consent Order already addressed, or where steps have been taken to address, include implementing new lending and compliance policies and new problem loan identification and resolution plans, strengthening Audit Committee oversight, creating a Compliance Committee of the Board, and developing a comprehensive, board-approved action plan for Macatawa Bank to address and monitor each requirement of the Consent Order. We are also evaluating alternatives to reach and maintain the capital levels required by the Consent Order in a timely fashion. We have not determined whether we will be able to meet the timeline prescribed by the Consent Order for reaching the required capital levels. Achievement of these capital levels could be impacted, positively or negatively, as a result of certain uncertainties, including, but not limited to, earnings levels, changing economic conditions, asset quality and property values. Potential Written Agreement with Macatawa and its Regulator Macatawa expects that it will also enter into a Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the primary regulator of Macatawa, which will address issues arising out of the FRB's examination of Macatawa, which is currently in process. While the final form and terms of a Written Agreement are not yet determined, we expect the Written Agreement to address capital levels, liquidity, dividends, debt restrictions, stock redemptions and compliance with laws, but we are unable to predict with certainty the content or effect of a Written Agreement. The Company has already implemented changes designed to, among other items, preserve capital and liquidity of Macatawa. The Company previously suspended the payment of dividends on common and preferred stock and deferred interest payments on trust preferred securities. Additional information regarding these steps are included in Item 5 of this report, Item 7 of this - - 4 - report under the headings "Capital Resources" and "Liquidity of Holding Company" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference. In response to these recent developments, the Company has made the following changes to its internal operations for its major banking services, lending and deposits and other funding. Lending Activities Our Board of Directors has increased its governance over the lending function and, working directly with the management team, has taken tangible steps to improve process and controls. These steps are intended to reduce exposure within certain credit concentrations, establish more conservative lending principles that comply with regulatory standards, implement new lending and compliance policies and procedures and include enhanced problem loan identification and resolution plans. Some of the key strategies are discussed below.  Board Oversight. The Board appointed a Compliance Committee comprised of independent directors who will supervise compliance with the commitments the Bank made to the regulators in the Consent Order. The Audit and Compliance Committees both meet monthly to monitor, among other items, the new lending and compliance procedures. The Board also restructured the reporting lines for departments involved in managing activities involved in the lending function. The Special Asset Group responsible for the disposition of problem assets, the Credit Administration department responsible for implementation of loan policy and credit monitoring, and the Risk Management Department are led by qualified officers who report directly to the Audit Committee. The Board intends that all necessary resources will be allocated to ensure compliance and to allow the Bank to work out of its problem loans and assets.  Loan Review. The Loan Review function traditionally reported administratively through Credit Administration and functionally to the Board Loan Committee. Loan Review now reports functionally to the Audit Committee. The Risk Management department is now responsible administratively for the Loan Review function and is in process of expanding this team to include a Senior Loan Review Manager and additional resources to support our goal of completing an independent, annual review of the entire commercial loan portfolio to monitor the accuracy and completeness of the watch list and all risk grades. This process is intended to identify violations of law, rules, or regulations and policy, credit and collateral documentation exceptions and track corrective measures. This function is also responsible for the integrity of the loan grading system and the independent review of loan grades at inception and renewal.  Lender Accountability. Management established individual lender scorecards which are monitored on an ongoing basis. Lenders are apprised monthly of these targets/scorecards and held accountable. We evaluated the performance of individual lenders and implemented corrective action, including the termination of loan officers whose loan portfolios included a majority of the Company's non-performing assets.  Concentration Reduction. We implemented a concentration reduction plan to measure and monitor concentrations of credit on an ongoing basis. Execution of that plan included curtailing the origination of residential land development loans, the portfolio primarily responsible for loan losses in 2008 and 2009. Increased emphasis has been placed on obtaining updated property valuations and "right- sizing" of loan balances either through pay downs or by obtaining additional collateral in order to protect the Bank.  Loan Policies and Procedures. Loan policy and underwriting guidelines were significantly enhanced in 2009 and have been reassessed for compliance with regulatory requirements and disciplined business practices. Improvements have been made to the Appraisal Policy, Commercial Loan Policy, Environmental Risk Policy, Consumer Loan Policy, Loan Loss Reserve Policy, Non-Accrual and Charged-Off Loan Policy, Real Estate Loan Policy and Loan Review Policy. Further enhancements to the control framework will be evaluated on an on-going basis. - 5 -  Plan to Reduce Substandard Assets. We recognize the need to reduce our risk position related to substandard assets. We are formulating and implementing specific plans for each asset identified as substandard. Reductions will be achieved in a variety of ways, including collecting, charging off, upgrading (when appropriate and independently verified), right-sizing, or improving the quality of the assets. The ultimate objective is to return the amount of these assets to an acceptable level. The Bank also recognizes that the downturn in real estate may be sustained and it must continuously reevaluate every classified loan. The economic environment has a direct impact on the market and all targets will be re-evaluated regularly as these plans evolve. The specific plans are reviewed and approved by the Audit and Compliance Committees at monthly meetings. Deposits and Other Funding Activities During 2009 the Bank's regulatory capital ratios fell below levels required to be categorized as "well capitalized" under applicable regulatory guidelines. In addition, because the Bank is subject to the Consent Order, the Bank cannot be categorized as "well-capitalized," regardless of actual capital levels. As of the date of this report, the Bank was categorized as "adequately capitalized." As a result, the Bank is subject to the following restrictions regarding its deposit gathering activities:  Effective January 1, 2010, the interest rate paid for deposits by institutions that are categorized as less than "well capitalized" is limited to 75 basis points above the national rate for similar products unless the institution can support to the FDIC that prevailing rates in its market area exceed the national average. Although this may impact the ability of the Company to compete for more rate sensitive deposits, the Company expects its continued reduction in assets to reduce its need to utilize these more rate sensitive deposits.  The Bank cannot accept, renew or rollover any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC. The Bank has not accepted or renewed brokered deposits since November of 2008. A maturity table of deposits issued through brokers is included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of its contingent liquidity planning, the Bank is prepared to submit an application with the FDIC to request a waiver from this prohibition if it is considered necessary. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Bank elected to participate in the Transaction Account Guaranty Program of the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which provides full insurance on all noninterest-bearing deposits and certain interest-bearing deposits. There were approximately $125 million in deposit balances as of February 26, 2010 that were receiving additional insurance protection under this program. The program is set to end on June 30, 2010 and there can be no assurance the Bank will retain all participating balances when the program expires. See the risk factor in Item 1A of this report entitled "If the Transaction Account Guaranty Program of the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program expires on June 30, 2010 as currently scheduled, then the Bank could experience a significant reduction in uninsured deposits, which could materially adversely affect the Bank's liquidity position." The Company has developed alternative programs for customers utilizing the Transaction Account Guaranty Program in the event the program is not renewed. These alternative programs are designed to allow these customers, if they choose, to move funds previously insured under the Transaction Account Guaranty Program to an off-balance sheet relationship, such as investment securities through our Trust Department. The goal of these alternative programs is to maintain these customer relationships until a time when these customers decide to move funds back to on-balance sheet deposit relationships. There is no assurance that these customers will participate in these alternative programs and, if they do, there is no assurance that these customers will decide to move any funds back to on-balance sheet deposit relationships in the future. The Company plans to continue to invest significant effort to further reduce its loan portfolio and focus on deposit growth and retention within its markets to minimize the impact of recent events and restrictions on deposit gathering activities. Products and Services Loan Portfolio We have historically offered a broad range of loan products to business customers, including commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, and to retail customers, including residential mortgage and consumer loans. Given current weak economic conditions and the provisions of the Consent Order, new commercial loan origination activity is significantly lower than it was when economic conditions were stronger. However, certain well-managed loan renewal activity for non-real estate loans is taking place. Following is a discussion of our various types of lending activities. - - 6 - Commercial and Industrial Loans Our commercial and industrial lending portfolio contains loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance operations and equipment. Generally, our commercial and industrial lending has been limited to borrowers headquartered, or doing business, in our primary market area. These credit relationships typically require the satisfaction of appropriate loan covenants and debt formulas, and generally require that Macatawa Bank be the primary depository bank of the business. These loan covenants and debt formulas are monitored through periodic, required reporting of accounts receivable aging schedules and financial statements, and in the case of larger business operations, reviews or audits by independent professional firms. Commercial and industrial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself, as well as economic conditions. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Commercial Real Estate Loans Because of the risks associated with this type of lending combined with the sharp decline in demand for and resulting values of real estate in our market in the last two years, the Company experienced a significant increase in non-performing loan levels during 2008 and 2009 primarily associated with commercial real estate loans. The increase in nonperforming loan balances is more fully discussed in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." Our commercial real estate loans consist primarily of construction and development loans and multi-family and other non-residential real estate loans. Construction and Development Loans. These consist of construction loans to commercial customers for the construction of their business facilities. They also include construction loans to builders and developers for the construction of one- to four-family residences and the development of one- to four-family lots, residential subdivisions, condominium developments and other commercial developments. This portfolio has been particularly adversely affected by job losses, declines in real estate value, declines in home sale volumes, and declines in new home building. Declining real estate values have resulted in sharp increases in losses, particularly in the land development and construction loan portfolios to residential developers. The Company curtailed this type of lending in 2008. During 2009, the Company also made a significant effort to reduce its exposure to residential land development and other construction and development loans. As discussed in this Item 1 under the heading "Recent Business Developments," it has also established goals to further reduce this exposure in 2010. Multi-Family and Other Non-Residential Real Estate Loans. These are permanent loans secured by multi-family and other non-residential real estate and include loans secured by apartment buildings, condominiums, small office buildings, small business facilities, medical facilities and other non-residential building properties, substantially all of which are located within our primary market area. Multi-family and other non-residential real estate loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family residences. This greater risk is due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of these loans is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. If cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. For example, if leases are not obtained or renewed, or a bankruptcy court modifies a lease term, or a major tenant is unable to fulfill its lease obligations, cash flow from the project will be reduced. Retail Loans Our retail loans are loans to consumers and consist primarily of residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Residential Mortgage Loans. We originate construction loans to individuals for the construction of their residences and owner-occupied residential mortgage loans, which are generally long-term with either fixed or adjustable interest rates. Our general - - 7 - policy is to sell the majority of our fixed rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market due primarily to the interest rate risk associated with these loans. During 2009, we sold the majority of our loan originations into the secondary market to support our goal of shrinking the loan portfolio and preserving capital. We retained only approximately 14% of the dollar volume originated. During 2009, our ability to originate and sell mortgages was limited to some extent by disruptions in the secondary market and our loss of business relationships with certain companies that have historically purchased our mortgages. However, relationships have been established with new investors in 2010 so as to not materially disrupt our customary practices of originating and selling most of our fixed rate mortgage loan volume. Our borrowers generally qualify and are underwritten using industry standards for quality residential mortgage loans. We do not originate loans that are considered "sub-prime". Residential mortgage loan originations derive from a number of sources, including advertising, direct solicitation, real estate broker referrals, existing borrowers and depositors, builders and walk-in customers. Loan applications are accepted at most of our offices. The substantial majority of these loans are secured by one-to-four family properties in our market area. Consumer Loans. We originate a variety of different types of consumer loans, including automobile loans, home equity lines of credit and installment loans, home improvement loans, deposit account loans and other loans for household and personal purposes. We also originate home equity lines of credit utilizing the same underwriting standards as for home equity installment loans. Home equity lines of credit are revolving line of credit loans. The majority of our existing home equity line of credit portfolio has variable rates with floors and ceilings, interest only payments and a maximum maturity of ten years. The underwriting standards that we employ for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability, and are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances . Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.

Additional interest income of $4.83 million would have been recorded during 2009 on these loans had they been current in accordance with their original terms. The increase in nonperforming loan balances in 2009 and information about our policy for placing loans on non-accrual status may be found in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." Loans at December 31, 2009 that were classified as substandard or worse per the Company's internal risk rating system, including those on an accrual basis not included in the nonperforming assets table above, that would cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms are discussed in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." At December 31, 2009, there were no other interest-bearing assets that would be required to be disclosed under Industry Guide 3, Item III, C. 1. or 2. if such assets were loans. Loan Loss Experience The following is a summary of our loan balances at the end of each period and the daily average balances of these loans. It also includes changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged-off and recoveries on loans previously charged-off, and additions to the allowance which we have expensed.

Transaction accounts and savings and time certificates are tailored to the principal market area at rates competitive with those offered in the area. All deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount permitted by law. We solicit deposit services from individuals, businesses, associations, churches, nonprofit organizations, financial institutions and government authorities. Deposits are gathered primarily from the communities we serve through our network of 26 branches. We offer business and consumer checking accounts, regular and money market savings accounts, and certificates of deposit with many term options. We operate in a competitive environment, competing with other local banks similar in size and with significantly larger regional banks. We monitor rates at other financial institutions in the area to ascertain that our rates are competitive with the market. We also attempt to offer a wide variety of products to meet the needs of our customers. We set our deposit pricing to be competitive with other banks in our market area. We have also utilized alternative funding sources as needed, including short-term borrowings, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis or the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, securities sold under agreements to repurchase ("repo borrowings") and certificates of deposit purchased from brokers. We have, historically, periodically purchased brokered deposits to supplement funding needs. These are time accounts originated outside of our local market area. Brokered deposits comprised approximately 15% of total deposits at December 31, 2009 and approximately 20% at December 31, 2008. The Bank has not accepted or renewed brokered deposits since November of 2008. Additional information about the restrictions on the Bank's deposit gathering activities may be found in this Item 1 under the heading "Recent Business Developments - Deposits and Other Funding Activities," and is here incorporated by reference.

Securities Portfolio Our securities portfolio is classified as either "available for sale" or "held to maturity." Securities classified as "available for sale" may be sold prior to maturity due to changes in interest rates, prepayment risks, and availability of alternative investments, or to meet our liquidity needs. The primary objective of our investing activities is to provide for the safety of the principal invested. Our secondary considerations include the maximization of earnings, liquidity and to help decrease our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company has generally invested in bonds with lower credit risk; primarily those secured by government agencies or insured municipalities, to assist in the diversification of credit risk within the Company's asset base. The Company has not experienced any credit losses within its investment portfolio. The following table reflects the composition of our securities portfolio as of the dates indicated.

As of December 31, 2009, the Trust Department managed assets of approximately $884.4 million. Our types of service include both personal trust and retirement plan services. Our personal trust services include financial planning, investment management services, trust and estate administration and custodial services. As of December 31, 2009, personal trust assets under management totaled approximately $735.5 million. Our retirement plan services provide all types of qualified retirement plans, including profit sharing, 401(k) and pension plans. As of December 31, 2009, retirement plan assets under management totaled approximately $148.9 million. Market Area Our primary market area includes Ottawa, Kent and northern Allegan Counties, all located in Western Michigan. This area consists of two mid-sized cities, Grand Rapids and Holland, and rural areas. Grand Rapids is the second largest city in Michigan and Holland is the largest city in Ottawa County. Both cities and surrounding areas have a solid and diverse economic base, which includes health and life sciences, tourism, office furniture, automotive components and assemblies, pharmaceutical, transportation, equipment, food and construction supplies. Companies operating in the market area include the Van Andel Institute, Steelcase, Herman Miller, Alticor, Gentex, Spectrum Health, Haworth, Johnson Controls, General Motors, Gerber, SPX, Magna, and Meijer. Competition There are many bank, thrift, credit union and other financial institution offices located within our market area. Most are branches of larger financial institutions. We also face competition from finance companies, insurance companies, mortgage companies, securities brokerage firms, money market funds and other providers of financial services. Many of our competitors have been in business a number of years, have established customer bases, are larger and have higher lending limits than we do. We compete for loans, deposits and other financial services based on our ability to communicate effectively with our customers, to understand and meet their needs and to provide high quality customer service. Our management believes that our personal service philosophy, our local decision-making and diverse delivery channels enhances our ability to compete favorably in attracting individuals and small businesses. We actively solicit customers by offering our customers personal attention, professional service, and com petitive interest rates. Employees As of December 31, 2009, we had 380 full-time equivalent employees consisting of 310 full-time and 98 part-time employees. We have assembled a staff of experienced, dedicated and highly qualified professionals whose goal is to meet the financial needs of our customers while providing outstanding service. The majority of our management team has at least 10 years of banking experience, and several key personnel have more than 20 years of banking experience. None of our employees is represented by collective bargaining agreements with us. Acquisitions Effective June 30, 2009, the operations of Macatawa Bank Mortgage Company were consolidated with and into Macatawa Bank, and the Mortgage Company was subsequently dissolved and liquidated. All products and services previously provided by the Mortgage Company are now provided by Macatawa Bank. On January 1, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Smith & Associates. The Company in turn contributed the business to Macatawa Bank. - - 13 - SUPERVISION AND REGULATION The following is a summary of certain statutes and regulations affecting Macatawa Bank Corporation and Macatawa Bank. This summary is qualified in its entirety by such statutes and regulations. A change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on us and our business. General Financial institutions and their holding companies are extensively regulated under federal and state law. Consequently, our growth and earnings performance can be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the statutes administered by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities. Those authorities include, but are not limited to, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), the FDIC, OFIR, the Internal Revenue Service, and state taxing authorities. The effect of such statutes, regulations and policies can be significant, and cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty. Federal and state laws and regulations generally applicable to financial institutions and their holding companies regulate, among other things, the scope of business, investments, reserves against deposits, capital levels relative to operations, lending activities and practices, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, mergers, consolidations and dividends. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to us and our bank establishes a comprehensive framework for our respective operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC's deposit insurance funds, our depositors, and the public, rather than our shareholders. Federal law and regulations establish supervisory standards applicable to the lending activities of our bank, including internal controls, credit underwriting, loan documentation and loan-to-value ratios for loans secured by real property. Recent Regulatory Developments Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) was enacted. EESA enables the federal government, under terms and conditions to be developed by the Secretary of the Treasury, to insure troubled assets, including mortgage-backed securities, and collect premiums from participating financial institutions. EESA includes, among other provisions: (a) the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), under which the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to purchase, insure, hold, and sell a wide variety of financial instruments, and (b) an increase in the amount of deposit insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Both of these specific provisions are discussed in the below sections. Under the TARP, the Department of Treasury authorized a voluntary capital purchase program (CPP) to purchase senior preferred shares of qualifying financial institutions that elected to participate by November 14, 2008. We did not participate in the CPP. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). EESA temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. The limit is scheduled to return to $100,000 on January 1, 2014. Separate from EESA, in October 2008, the FDIC also announced the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. Under one component of this program, the FDIC temporarily provides unlimited coverage for noninterest bearing transaction deposit accounts through June 30, 2010. Financial Stability Plan. On February 10, 2009, the Financial Stability Plan (FSP) was announced by the U.S. Treasury Department. The FSP is a comprehensive set of measures intended to shore up the financial system. The core elements of the plan include making bank capital injections, creating a public-private investment fund to buy troubled assets, establishing guidelines for loan modification programs and expanding the Federal Reserve lending program. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was enacted. ARRA is intended to provide a stimulus to the U.S. economy in the wake of the economic downturn brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis and the resulting credit crunch. The bill includes federal tax cuts, expansion of unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions, and domestic spending in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, including the energy structure. The new law also includes numerous non-economic recovery related items, including a limitation on executive compensation in federally aided banks. Under ARRA, an institution will be subject to a number of restrictions and standards throughout the period in which any obligation arising from financial assistance provided under TARP remains outstanding. - - 14 - Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan. On February 18, 2009, the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan (HASP) was announced by the President of the United States. HASP is intended to support a recovery in the housing market and ensure that workers can continue to pay off their mortgages through the following elements:  Provide access to low-cost refinancing for responsible homeowners suffering from falling home prices.  A $75 billion homeowner stability initiative to prevent foreclosure and help responsible families stay in their homes.  Support low mortgage rates by strengthening confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. More details regarding HASP are expected to be announced at a future date. Macatawa Bank Corporation General. Macatawa Bank Corporation is registered with, and subject to regulation by, the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended (the "BHCA"). Under the BHCA, we are subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and are required to file with the Federal Reserve Board periodic reports of our operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require. In accordance with Federal Reserve Board policy, we are expected to act as a source of financial strength to Macatawa Bank and to commit resources to support Macatawa Bank in circumstances where we might not do so absent such policy. In addition, if the OFIR deems Macatawa Bank's capital to be impaired, the OFIR may require Macatawa Bank to restore its capital by a special assessment upon us as the bank's sole shareholder. If we were to fail to pay any such assessment, the directors of Macatawa Bank would be required, under Michigan law, to sell the shares of the bank's stock owned by us to the highest bidder at either a public or private auction and use the proceeds of the sale to restore the bank's capital. As discussed in this Item 1 under the heading "Recent Business Developments," Macatawa expects that it will enter into a Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the primary regulator of Macatawa. Investments and Activities. In general, any direct or indirect acquisition by us of any voting shares of any bank which would result in our direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank, and any merger or consolidation between us and another financial holding company or bank holding company, will require the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA. No Federal Reserve Board approval is required for us to acquire a company, other than a bank holding company or bank, engaged in activities that are financial in nature as determined by the Federal Reserve Board. The merger or consolidation of an existing bank subsidiary of ours with another bank, or the acquisition by such a subsidiary of assets of another bank, or the assumption of liability by such a subsidiary to pay any deposits in another bank, will require the prior written approval of the responsible Federal depository institution regulatory agency under the Bank Merger Act. In addition, in certain such cases, an application to, and the prior approval of, the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA and/or the OFIR under the Michigan Banking Code, may be required. Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board uses capital adequacy guidelines in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies. If capital falls below minimum guidelines, a bank holding company may, among other items, be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses. The Company could be subject to additional capital requirements should a Written Agreement be entered into with the FRB. Additional information on the capital ratios of the Company may be found in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Capital Resources" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference. Dividends. Macatawa Bank Corporation is a corporation separate and distinct from Macatawa Bank. Most of our revenues are dividends paid by our bank. Thus, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is indirectly limited by restrictions on our bank's ability to pay dividends described below. Further, in a policy statement, the Federal Reserve Board has expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends exceeding its net income or which can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company's financial health, such as by borrowing. The Federal Reserve Board also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. Similar enforcement powers over our bank are possessed by the FDIC. The "prompt corrective action" provisions of federal law and - - 15 - regulation authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to restrict the payment of dividends by us for an insured bank which fails to meet specified capital levels. In addition to the restrictions on dividends imposed by the Federal Reserve Board, the Michigan Business Corporation Act provides that dividends may be legally declared or paid only if after the distribution a corporation, like us, can pay its debts as they come due in the usual course of business and its total assets equal or exceed the sum of its liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of any holders of preferred stock whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. The Company previously suspended the payment of dividends on common and preferred stock and deferred interest payments on trust preferred securities. Additional information regarding the suspension of dividends and deferral of interest payments may be found in Item 5 of this report, Item 7 of this report under the heading "Capital Resources" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference. Changes in Directors and Senior Executive Officers. The Company and the Bank have each been advised by their federal bank regulators that they are deemed to be in troubled condition. As a result, the Company and the Bank must each (i) provide their federal bank regulator with at least 30 days' prior notice before appointing any new director or senior executive officer or changing the responsibilities of any senior executive officer; and (ii) obtain the approval of their federal bank regulator before making (or agreeing to make) any severance payments (except pursuant to a qualified pension or retirement plan and certain other employee benefit plans). These regulatory requirements could make it more difficult for the Company and the Bank to retain and hire qualified senior management. Federal Securities Regulation. The Company's common stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). We are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act. We are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes numerous reporting, accounting, corporate governance and business practices on companies, as well as financial and other professionals who have involvement with the U.S. public markets. The Company is generally subject to these requirements and applicable SEC rules and regulations. Macatawa Bank General. Macatawa Bank is a Michigan banking corporation, and its deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the "DIF") of the FDIC. As a DIF insured Michigan chartered bank, Macatawa Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the OFIR, as the chartering authority for Michigan banks, and the FDIC, as administrator of DIF. These agencies and the federal and state laws applicable to our bank and its operations, extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business including, among other things, permissible types and amounts of loans, investments and other activities, capital adequacy, branching, interest rates on loans and on deposits, the maintenance of non-interest bearing reserves on deposit accounts, and the safety and soundness of banking practices. On February 22, 2010, Macatawa Bank entered into a Consent Order with the FDIC and OFIR. Additional information regarding the Consent Order may be found in this Item 1 of the report under the heading "Recent Business Developments." Deposit Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, we are required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system under which all insured depository institutions are placed into one of four categories and assessed insurance premiums, based upon their respective levels of capital and results of supervisory evaluation. Institutions classified as well-capitalized (as defined by the FDIC) and considered healthy pay the lowest premium while institutions that are less than adequately capitalized (as defined by the FDIC) and considered of substantial supervisory concern pay the highest premium. Risk classification of all insured institutions is made by the FDIC for each semi-annual assessment period. The FDIC is required to establish assessment rates for insured depository institutions at levels that will maintain the DIF at a Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR) selected by the FDIC within a range of 1.15% to 1.50%. The FDIC is allowed to manage the pace at which the reserve ratio varies within this range. Due to recent disruptions in the financial markets and the large numbers of bank failures in the last year, the DRR has fallen below 1.15%. The FDIC has adopted an Amended Restoration Plan which established the time within which the reserve ratio must be returned to 1.15% to seven years. The FDIC imposed a special assessment on all insured depository institutions that was collected on September 30, 2009. The Board may impose additional special assessments thereafter under certain circumstances. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2009, insured - - 16 - institutions were required to prepay their estimated risk-based assessments for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012 based on a 5% annual growth rate. Effective January 1, 2011, annual assessment rates will uniformly increase by 3 basis points. Effective April 1, 2009, most well-capitalized banks pay 12 to 16 basis points annually, increasing to 45 basis points for banks that pose significant supervisory concerns. This base rate may be adjusted based upon the level of unsecured debt, secured liabilities or brokered deposits, as defined, resulting in adjusted rates ranging from 7 to 24 basis points annually for most well capitalized banks and 40 to 77.5 basis points annually for banks that pose significant supervisory concerns. We estimate our annual assessment rate for 2010 to be between 32 and 35 basis points. FICO Assessments. Our bank, as a member of the BIF, is subject to assessments to cover the payments on outstanding obligations of the Financing Corporation ("FICO"). FICO was created to finance the recapitalization of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, the predecessor to the FDIC's Savings Association Insurance Fund (the "SAIF") which insures the deposits of thrift institutions. From now until the maturity of the outstanding FICO obligations in 2019, BIF members and SAIF members will share the cost of the interest on the FICO bonds on a pro rata basis. It is estimated that FICO assessments during this period will be less than 0.025% of deposits. Capital Requirements. The FDIC has established the following minimum capital standards for state-chartered, FDIC insured non-member banks, such as Macatawa Bank: a leverage requirement consisting of a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total average assets and a risk-based capital requirement consisting of a ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital consists principally of shareholders' equity. Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The extent of the regulators' powers depends on whether the institution in question is "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," or "critically undercapitalized." Federal regulations define these capital categories as follows: Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio Leverage Ratio Well capitalized 10% or above 6% or above 5% or above Adequately capitalized 8% or above 4% or above 4% or above Undercapitalized Less than 8% Less than 4% Less than 4% Significantly undercapitalized Less than 6% Less than 3% Less than 3% Critically undercapitalized -- -- A ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2% or less Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators' corrective powers include: requiring the submission of a capital restoration plan; placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities; requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to be acquired; restricting transactions with affiliates; restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits; ordering a new election of directors of the institution; requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. In general, a depository institution may be reclassified to a lower category than is indicated by its capital levels if the appropriate federal depository institution regulatory agency determines the institution to be otherwise in an unsafe or unsound condition or to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice. This could include a failure by the institution, following receipt of a less-than-satisfactory rating on its most recent examination report, to correct the deficiency. Higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual institutions. As long as the Bank is subject to the Consent Order, the Bank cannot be categorized as "well-capitalized" regardless of actual capital levels. As of the date of this report, the Bank was categorized as "adequately capitalized." The Consent Order requires the Bank, within 90 days, to have and maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of at least 8% and a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio of at least 11%. Additional information regarding our ability to achieve these capital levels may be found in this Item 1 under the heading "Recent Business Developments," and is here incorporated by reference. Additional information on the capital ratios of the Bank may be found in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference. - - 17 - Dividends. Under Michigan law, our bank is restricted as to the maximum amount of dividends it may pay on its common stock. Our bank may not pay dividends except out of net income after deducting its losses and bad debts. A Michigan state bank may not declare or pay a dividend unless the bank will have surplus amounting to at least 20% of its capital after the payment of the dividend. Federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDIC may prevent an insured bank from paying dividends if the bank is in default of payment of any assessment due to the FDIC. In addition, the FDIC may prohibit the payment of dividends by our bank, if such payment is determined to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Additional information about restrictions on payment of dividends by the Bank may be found in this Item 1 under the heading "Recent Business Developments" and in Item 8 of this report under the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference. Insider Transactions. Our bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on any extensions of credit to us or our subsidiaries, on investments in the stock or other securities of our or our subsidiaries and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of us or our subsidiaries as collateral for loans. Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by our bank to its directors and officers, to our directors and officers, the directors and officers of our bank, to our principal shareholders and to "related interests" of such directors, officers and principal shareholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person becoming a director or officer of our company or one of its subsidiaries or a principal shareholder in our company may obtain credit from banks with which our bank maintains a correspondent relationship. Safety and Soundness Standards. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines to promote the safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions. These guidelines establish standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings. Investments and Other Activities. Under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law, as implemented by FDIC regulations, also prohibits FDIC insured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank or its subsidiary, respectively, unless the bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines the activity would not pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund of which the bank is a member. Impermissible investments and activities must be divested or discontinued within certain time frames set by the FDIC in accordance with federal law. These restrictions are not currently expected to have a material impact on the operations of our bank. Consumer Protection Laws. Our bank's business includes making a variety of types of loans to individuals. In making these loans, we are is subject to State usury and regulatory laws and to various federal statutes, including the privacy of consumer financial information provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and regulations promulgated there under, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the regulations promulgated there under, which prohibit discrimination, specify disclosures to be made to borrowers regarding credit and settlement costs, and regulate the mortgage loan servicing activities of our bank, including the maintenance and operation of escrow accounts and the transfer of mortgage loan servicing. In receiving deposits, our bank is subject to extensive regulation under State and federal law and regulations, including the Truth in Savings Act, the E xpedited Funds Availability Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Violation of these laws could result in the imposition of significant damages and fines upon our bank and its directors and officers. Branching Authority. Michigan banks have the authority under Michigan law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Michigan, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. Banks may establish interstate branch networks through acquisitions of other banks. The establishment of de novo interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) is allowed only if specifically authorized by state law. Michigan permits both U.S. and non-U.S. banks to establish branch offices in Michigan. The Michigan Banking Code permits, in appropriate circumstances and with the approval of the Michigan Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation, Division of Financial Institutions, (1) acquisition of Michigan banks by FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states, (2) sale by a Michigan bank of branches to an FDIC-insured bank, savings bank or savings and loan association located in a state in which a Michigan bank could purchase branches of the purchasing entity, - - 18 - (3) consolidation of Michigan banks and FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states having laws permitting such consolidation, (4) establishment of branches in Michigan by FDIC-insured banks located in other states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories or protectorates having laws permitting a Michigan bank to establish a branch in such jurisdiction, and (5) establishment by foreign banks of branches located in Michigan. A Michigan bank holding company may acquire a non-Michigan bank and a non-Michigan bank holding company may acquire a Michigan bank. ITEM 1A: Risk Factors. Risks related to the Company's Business The Company's past operating results may not be indicative of its future operating results. The Company's strategic direction and focus has turned from growth to improving its internal operations, including complying with the Consent Order, working out of its problem loans and assets and returning the Company to profitable operations. The Company will not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth in the near future, may not even be able to grow its business at all and be forced to shrink assets to maintain regulatory capital ratios. Various factors, many of which are discussed in more detail in the risk factors below, that may impede or prohibit the Company's ability to grow include, the impact of elevated levels of non-performing assets, the inability to maintain or access additional capital and liquidity sources, economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition. If the Company experiences a significant decrease in its size, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected due to the percentage of its operating costs be ing fixed expenses. Our elevated level of non-performing assets and other problem loans could continue to have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Our non-performing assets were approximately $141.1 million (which includes non-accrual loans classified as substandard per our internal risk rating system) and our other accruing loans classified as substandard per our internal risk rating system were $68.2 million at December 31, 2009. These elevated levels could continue to negatively impact operating results through higher loan losses, lost interest and higher costs to administer problem assets. Until these elevated levels of problem assets are reduced, the Company could continue to record operating losses that further materially deteriorate the Company's financial condition and reduce capital levels, further exposing the Company to additional risk factors discussed below. The national, state and local economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. The results of operations for financial institutions, including our bank, may be materially and adversely affected by changes in prevailing national, state and local economic conditions. Our profitability is heavily influenced by the quality of the Company's loan portfolio and the stability of the Company's deposits. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in Ottawa, Kent and Allegan Counties of Western Michigan. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the Company's products and services, as well as the ability of the Company's customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Company's deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemplo yment, changes in securities, financial, or credit markets or other factors could impact national as well as these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. The failure to comply with the Consent Order could result in enforcement proceedings. The Bank is subject to a Consent Order with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Michigan Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation. The failure of the Bank to comply with the terms of the Consent Order could result in proceedings to enforce the Consent Order. Such proceedings could result in removal of directors, officers, employees and institution affiliated parties, the imposition of civil money penalties and even ultimately closure of the Bank. The Company will likely become subject to a regulatory order. The Company will likely enter into a Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve Board to address issues arising out of the Federal Reserve Board's examination of the Company, which is in process as of the date of this report. While the final form and terms of a Written Agreement are not yet determined, we expect the Written Agreement to address capital levels, cash flow, dividends, debt restrictions, stock redemptions and compliance with laws, but we are unable to predict with certainty the content or effect of a written agreement. - - 19 - Our independent auditor has included a going concern paragraph in its opinion on its audit of our consolidated financial statements. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company incurred significant net losses in 2009 and 2008, primarily from higher provisions for loan losses and expenses associated with the administration and disposition of non-performing assets at the Bank. These losses have caused the Bank's regulatory capital to fall from well capitalized to adequately capitalized, which in turn limits its ability to use certain funding sources, such as brokered deposits. As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements, wherein management has stated there is uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern, the Bank is under a regulatory consent order that requires among other provisions, higher regulatory capital requirements. The Bank did not meet the higher capital requirement at December 31, 2009 and is not expected to be in compliance with the regulatory agreement within the timeframe in the Consent Order, nor by Decem ber 31, 2010 or beyond, without an external capital infusion. Failure to reduce the level of non-performing assets, higher costs to administer and dispose of those assets and comply with the consent order, limitations on funding sources, and failure to comply with higher regulatory capital requirements may result in additional enforcement actions, including closure of the Bank. Our auditor has expressed the opinion that these events raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Additional information about the Consent Order and the efforts we have undertaken to address the Consent Order and improve the operations, results of operations, and financial condition of Macatawa and the Bank is presented in Item 1 of this report under the heading "Recent Business Developments" and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report. Although our ability to successfully address all of these issues is not assured, management respectfull y disagrees with the auditor's opinion that there is substantial doubt versus uncertainty about Macatawa's ability to continue as a going concern. These factors could result in a loss of confidence in the Bank by our customers, investors and the public, which loss of confidence could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. If the Company cannot raise additional capital to satisfy the capital levels required by the Consent Order in a timely fashion, then its ability to maintain its current level of assets and to further expand its operations through organic growth could be materially impaired. In addition, the Bank could become subject to an enforcement action. Within 90 days after the date of the Consent Order, the Bank is required to have and maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of at least 8% and a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio of at least 11%. We are evaluating alternatives to reach and maintain the capital levels required by the Consent Order in a timely fashion. We have not determined whether we will be able to meet the timeline prescribed by the Consent Order for reaching the required capital levels. Achievement of these capital levels could be impacted, positively or negatively, as a result of certain uncertainties, including, but not limited to, earnings levels, changing economic conditions, asset quality and property values. A failure to raise additional capital to satisfy the capital levels required by the Consent Order in a timely fashion could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain our current level of assets and to further expand our operations through organic growth. In addition, the Bank could become subject to an enforcement ac tion. See the risk factor entitled "The failure to comply with the Consent Order could result in enforcement proceedings" above. Additional information on the capital requirements applicable to the Bank may be found in this Item 1 of the report under the heading "Recent Business Developments," and is here incorporated by reference. The state of financial markets and the economy may adversely affect our sources of liquidity and capital. There has been significant recent turmoil and volatility in worldwide financial markets which is, at present, ongoing. These conditions have resulted in a disruption in the liquidity of financial markets, and could directly impact us if we need to access capital markets to raise capital to support our business and could impact our overall liquidity position. This situation could affect the cost of funds or our ability to raise funds. If we were unable to access capital or funding sources when needed, it could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory capital. The Company and Bank are subject to liquidity risk in their operations, which could adversely affect their ability to fund various obligations. Liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due, capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise, or pay regular dividends, because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, mortgage originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity of the Bank is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operation and access to other funding sources. Liquidity is essential to the Company's business. The Company and Bank must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale or pledging as collateral of loans and other assets could have a material adverse effect on the Company's and Bank's liquidity. An inability to retain the current level of deposits, including the loss of one or more of the Bank's larger deposit relationships, - - 20 - could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's liquidity. The Company's and Bank's access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance activities could be impaired by factors that affect the Company and Bank specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact the Company's and Bank's access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of the business activity due to a market down turn or regulatory action that limits or eliminates access to alternate funding sources, including brokered deposits discussed below. The Company's and Bank's ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are nonspecific to the Company, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole, as evidenced by recent turmoil in the domestic and worldwide credit markets. The Bank cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits without a waiver from the FDIC, which could materially adversely affect the Bank's liquidity position. Because the Bank is subject to a Consent Order, the Bank cannot be categorized as "well-capitalized," regardless of actual capital levels. As of the date of this report, the Bank was categorized as "adequately capitalized." As a result, the Bank cannot accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC. There is no assurance that the Bank will be granted a waiver of this prohibition in a timely manner or at all or for an amount sufficient to meet the Bank's liquidity needs. At December 31, 2009, the Bank's brokered deposits totaled $206,525,000 and represented 14.57% of deposits. If the Bank is not able to replace the funding required for maturing brokered deposits, the Bank's liquidity position could be materially adversely affected. If the Transaction Account Guaranty Program of the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program expires on June 30, 2010 as currently scheduled, then the Bank could experience a significant reduction in uninsured deposits, which could materially adversely affect the Bank's liquidity position. The Transaction Account Guaranty Program ("TAG") of the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program temporarily insured non-interest bearing deposits without limitation. TAG is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2010 with insured levels on non-interest bearing deposits returning to normal levels. The Bank is a participant in TAG. As of February 26, 2010, the Bank had approximately $125 million of deposit balances that were receiving additional insurance protection under TAG. If TAG expires as scheduled, the Bank could experience a significant reduction in previously insured but then uninsured deposits, which could materially adversely affect the Bank's liquidity position. Recent media reports indicate that the FDIC is considering extending TAG beyond June 30, 2010, but there is no assurance that the FDIC will do so. If the condition of the Bank's loan portfolio continues to worsen, its ability to borrow funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank could be adversely affected, which could materially adversely affect the Bank's liquidity position. As part of its liquidity management, the Bank borrows funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The borrowed funds are collateralized by certain investment securities and qualifying residential and commercial real estate loans. The Bank is permitted to borrow an amount of funds up to a certain percentage of the total investment securities and loans pledged as collateral. The Federal Home Loan Bank will not accept as collateral any loan that is rated as a 5 or worse on our internal loan grading system. If the quality of the Bank's loan portfolio continues to worsen, the Bank could have fewer loans eligible to be pledged as collateral for borrowed funds, reducing the total amount of available funds that the Bank is permitted to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank. A reduction in the total amount of the available funds that the Bank is permitted to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank could materially adversely affect the Bank's liquidity position. Our credit losses could increase and our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses. The risk of nonpayment of loans is inherent in all lending activities and nonpayment of loans may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and overall financial condition, as well as the value of our common stock. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for potential losses based on a number of factors. If our assumptions are wrong, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover our losses, which could have an adverse affect on our operating results, and may cause us to increase the allowance in the future. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot now be determined and may exceed the amounts of past provisions. Federal banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, whic h may be different from ours. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses could have a negative effect on our regulatory capital ratios, net income, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is subject to various lending risks depending on the nature of the borrower's business, its cash flow and our collateral. Repayment of our commercial loans is often dependent on cash flow of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our commercial loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the - - 21 - borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral is accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or real estate. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. Other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Our commercial real estate loans involve higher principal amounts than other loans, and repayment of these loans may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operating and management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower's control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral for the loan may be impaired. The value of real estate collateral may decrease due to local market factors and other reasons. Our construction and development loans are based upon estimates of costs to construct and value associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, upon the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. Delays in completing the project may arise from labor problems, material shortages and other unpredictable contingencies. If the estimate of the cost of construction is inaccurate, we may have to advance additional funds to complete construction. If our appraisal of the val ue of the completed project proves to be overstated, or if property values decline before repayment, we may have inadequate collateral securing repayment of the loan upon completion of the project. Our loan portfolio has and will continue to be affected by the on-going correction in residential real estate prices and reduced levels of home sales. Loans to residential developers involved in the development or sale of 1-4 family residential properties were approximately $153.3 million and $204.4 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008. There continues to be a general slowdown in the housing market in our market area, reflecting declining prices and excess inventories of houses to be sold. As a result, home builders have shown signs of financial deterioration. We expect the home builder market to continue to be volatile and anticipate continued pressure on the home builder segment. As we continue our on-going portfolio monitoring, we will make credit and reserve decisions based on the current conditions of the borrower or project combined with our expectations for the future. If the deterioration in the housing market continues, we could experience higher charge-offs and delinquencies in this portfolio. The Company may be required to pay additional insurance premiums to the FDIC, which could negatively impact earnings. Recent insured institution failures, as well as deterioration in banking and economic conditions, have significantly increased FDIC loss provisions, resulting in a decline in the designated reserve ratio to historical lows. The FDIC expects a higher rate of insured institution failures in the next few years compared to recent years; thus, the reserve ratio may continue to decline. In addition, the limit on FDIC coverage has been increased to $250,000 through December 31, 2013. These developments have caused the premiums assessed to the Company by the FDIC to increase. Further, depending upon any future losses that the FDIC insurance fund may suffer, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional premium increases in order to replenish the fund. The FDIC may need to set a higher base rate schedule or impose special assessments due to future financial institution failures and updated failure and loss projections. In addition, a decline in the Bank's CAMEL ratings could subject the Company to in creased FDIC insurance premiums. Potentially higher FDIC assessment rates could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations. We rely heavily on our management and other key personnel, and the loss of any of them may adversely affect our operations. We are and will continue to be dependent upon the services of our management team and other key personnel. In August 2009, Philip Koning resigned from the Board of Directors and from the position of Co-Chief Executive Officer. Ronald Haan, former Co-Chief Executive Officer, assumed the role of, and continues to serve as, interim Chief Executive Officer of the Bank and the Holding Company. In November, 2009, Richard Postma was appointed Chairman of the Board of Macatawa and the Bank. Senior officers were also appointed to key positions in Lending functions in both late 2009 and 2010. In addition, a number of loan officers who had not satisfactorily performed their responsibilities were terminated in 2009 and 2010. The uncertainty of these changes in management and the potential of losing the services of one or more key members of our management team could adversely affect our operations. - - 22 - The Company's controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. Management regularly reviews and updates the Company's internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. As discussed in Item 9a of this report, the Company received a letter from its independent auditor, Crowe Horwath LLP, which identified certain deficiencies in the Company's credit administration and allowance for loan losses process. Crowe Horwath LLP concluded that these control deficiencies constituted a "material weakness" in internal controls over financial reporting at December 31, 2009. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have also concluded that these control deficiencies constituted a "material weakness" in internal controls over financial reporting at December 31, 2009. The Company intends to remediate these deficiencies. Crowe Horwath LLP has also audited and issued an unqualified opinion on the Company's financial statements as of and for years ending December 31, 2008 and 2009. If we fail to remediate these control deficiencies, it is possible that a material misstatement of interim or annual financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In addition, any failure or circumvention of the Company's other controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company may be a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company and its subsidiaries may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation arising out of its business. The Company's insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it, and any claims asserted against it, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm its reputation or cause it to incur unexpected expenses, which could be material in amount. Should the ultimate expenses, judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed the Company's insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may it be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all. For additional information on legal matters, see Item 3 of this report. The Company could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions, including defaults by larger financial institutions. The Company's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships between financial institutions. The Company has exposure to multiple counterparties, and the Company routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as "systemic risk" and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which the Company interacts on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect the Company. Our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry. We face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment. We compete for deposits, loans and other financial services with numerous Michigan-based and out-of-state banks, thrifts, credit unions and other financial institutions as well as other entities which provide financial services. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as we are. Most of our competitors have been in business for many years, have established customer bases, are larger, and have substantially higher lending limits than we do. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. We are subject to significant government regulation, and any regulatory changes may adversely affect us. The banking industry is heavily regulated under both federal and state law. These regulations are primarily intended to protect customers, not our creditors or shareholders. As a bank holding company, we are also subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Reserve, in addition to other regulatory and self-regulatory organizations. Regulations affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change, and we cannot predict the ultimate effect of such changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or financial condition. - - 23 - Evaluation of investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition. The evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. Estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. The determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon the Company's periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised a s conditions change and new information becomes available. The Company's management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its reasonable judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management's evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Impairments to the carrying value of our investment securities may need to be taken in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The Company depends upon the accuracy and completeness of information about customers. In deciding whether to extend credit to customers, the Company may rely on information provided to it by its customers, including financial statements and other financial information. The Company may also rely on representations of customers as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. The Company's financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent that the Company extends credit in reliance on financial statements or other information provided by customers that is false or misleading. We continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements. The banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers. Risks associated with the Company's stock The Company's ability to pay dividends is limited and it may be unable to pay future dividends. The Company has suspended payment of dividends on its preferred and common stock in order to preserve capital. The Company's ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient regulatory capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company is limited by its obligation to maintain sufficient capital and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to banks generally and the Company specifically. If the Company or the Bank does not satisfy these regulatory requirements, the Company would be unable to resume payment of dividends on its preferred and common stock. Additional information on restrictions on payment of dividends by the Company and the Bank may be found in this Item 1 of this report under the heading "Recent Business Developments" and in Item 5 of this report, and is here incorporated by reference. The market price for our common stock fluctuates. The market price for our common stock can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors. These factors include, among other things:  Variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;  Changes in investors' or analysts' perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business;  The size of the public float of our common stock; - 24 -  Regulatory developments;  Trading volume in our common stock;  Market conditions; and  General economic conditions. The Company may issue additional shares of its common stock in the future, which could dilute a shareholder's ownership of common stock. The Company's articles of incorporation authorize its Board of Directors, without shareholder approval, to, among other things, issue additional shares of common or preferred stock. The issuance of any additional shares of common or preferred stock could be dilutive to a shareholder's ownership of Company common stock. To the extent that the Company issues options or warrants to purchase common stock in the future and the options or warrants are exercised, the Company's shareholders may experience further dilution. Holders of shares of Company common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, shareholders may not be permitted to invest in future issuances of Company common or preferred stock. Because of its capital requirements, the Company may find it necessary to sell common stock to raise capital under circumstances and at prices which result in extreme dilution. The Company may issue debt and equity securities that are senior to Company common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of Company common stock. The Company has in the past and may in the future increase its capital by entering into debt or debt-like financing or issuing debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock or common stock. In the event of the Company's liquidation, its lenders and holders of its debt securities would receive a distribution of the Company's available assets before distributions to the holders of Company common stock. The Company's decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control. The Company cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of its future offerings and debt financings. Future offerings could reduce the value of shares of Company common stock and dilute a shareholder's interest in the Company. Exercise of our outstanding Warrants to purchase common stock or conversion of our outstanding preferred stock could substantially dilute a shareholder's ownership of common stock. We have issued Warrants to purchase a total of 1,478,811 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $9.00 per share. Additional information about the Warrants may be found in Item 3 of this report and is here incorporated by reference. We have outstanding 31,290 shares of Class A Preferred Stock, which are convertible into approximately 3,496,032 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $8.95 per share. We have outstanding 2,350 shares of Class B Preferred Stock, which are convertible into approximately 391,675 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $6.00 per share. Additional information about the preferred stock may be found in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is here incorporated by reference. The exercise or conversion, in whole or in part, of these securities into shares of our common stock could substantially dilute a shareholder's ownership of common stock. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws and Michigan laws contain certain provisions that could make a takeover more difficult. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and the laws of Michigan, include provisions which are designed to provide our Board of Directors with time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control. The provisions also could diminish the opportunities for a holder of our common stock to participate in tender offers, including tender offers at a price above the then-current price for our common stock. These provisions could also prevent transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices, and may limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. The Michigan Business Corporation Act contains provisions intended to protect shareholders and prohibit or discourage certain types of hostile takeover activities. In addition to these provisions and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws, Federal law requires the Federal Reserve Board's approval prior to acquisition of "control" of a bank holding company. All of these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control at the company level without action by our shareholders, and therefore, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. - - 25 - ITEM 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments.
