D. Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure  We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries in China to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs through 2012. We have fully repaid the promissory note in the principal amount of US$19.6 million due on January 20, 2011, with an annual interest rate of 4.75%, issued to Mr. He Dang in connection with the investment by Aegis Media. The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31. 2009 2010 2011 (US$ in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 750 23,441 24,138 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (485 ) 2,667 (5,464 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (6,308 ) 40,053 (7,549 ) Effect of changes in exchange rate (43 ) 2,422 4,961 Net increase/decrease in cash and cash equivalents (6,086 ) 68,583 16,086 Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year 60,823 54,737 123,320 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year 54,737 123,320 139,406 Operating Activities Our net cash provided by operating activities was US$23.4 million in 2010 compared to US$0.8 million in 2009, primarily as a result of an increase in net income. Increase in advances from customers in 2010 was partially offset by increase in prepaid expenses, deposits and other current assets. In 2010, we received more advances from our clients for the purpose of securing television advertising time, however, at the same time we also used significantly more cash for prepaid expenses in connection with these purchases of client advertising media assets. Our increase in accounts receivables in 2010 was mainly due to the increase in revenue from our media investment business, which was offset by the increase in accounts payable. In 2010 the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the longer average payment term in our advertising agency business for both our CCTV and non-CCTV accounts. Our net cash provided by operating activities was US$24.1 million in 2011 compared to US$23.4 million in 2010, primarily as a result of an increase in net income. Increase in accounts receivable in 2011 was partially offset by increase in accounts payable. Our increase in accounts receivables in 2011 was mainly due to the increase in media investment revenue, especially the revenue from Hubei Economics Provincial TV which has a relatively longer accounts receivable collections period during its ramp up stage, which was offset by the increase in accounts payable mainly to CCTV. 71 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities largely reflects our capital expenditures, which consists of purchases of fixed assets, such as computers and other office equipment. Our net cash used in investing activities amounted to US$0.5 million in 2009, net cash provided by investing activities amounted to US$2.7 million in 2010, and net cash used by investing activities amounted to US$5.5 million in 2011. The cash provided by investing activities in 2010 was mainly due to acquisition of Beijing Vizeum Advertising Co., Ltd. The cash used by investing activities in 2011 was primarily due to acquisition of Clickpro and investments to set up joint ventures of Wasu Digital Co., Ltd and Chongqing Changhui Financing Activities In 2009, we had net cash used in financing activities of US$6.3 million, which primarily consisted of partial payment of previously declared dividend to our shareholder. In 2010, we had net cash provided by financing activities of US$40.1 million, which was mainly due to the proceeds from our initial public offering. In 2011, we had net cash used by financing activities of US$7.5 million, which was primarily consisted of the final payment of previously declared dividend to our shareholder and our share repurchase program starting from September 2011.
