D. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We may not be able to commercialize our product candidates in development for numerous reasons.” 75 We will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, as well as an assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates, if any, will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements. Selling and Marketing Expenses In the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred $1.9 million of selling and marketing expenses, compared to $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $0.5 million, or approximately (20.5%). This decrease was primarily due to a $0.4 million decrease in marketing activities related to promotions and trade show attendance. Selling and marketing expenses accounted for approximately 2.5% and 3.9% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. General and Administrative Expenses In the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred $4.8 million of general and administrative expenses, compared to $5.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $0.3 million, or approximately 6.7%. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of salary expenses. General and administrative expenses accounted for approximately 6.6% and 8.6% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Financial Income In the year ended December 31, 2012, we generated $0.6 million of financial income, compared to $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $0.3 million, or approximately 33.6%. This decrease was due to a decrease in interest received from bank deposits and other short term investments. Income (expense) in respect of exchange and translation differences and derivatives instruments On January 1, 2012 we changed our functional currency from NIS to U.S. dollars. See also Note 2d in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. In the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred $0.1 million of expenses in respect of currency exchange differences on balances in other currencies versus the U.S. dollar compared to $0.9 million of income in respect of translation and currency exchange differences and derivatives in the year ended December 31, 2011. Income (expense) in respect of revaluation of warrants to fair value In the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred $0.6 million of expenses in respect of revaluation of warrants to fair value, compared to $0.5 million of income in the year ended December 31, 2011, in respect of revaluation of warrants to fair value due to change in share prices and expected life of the warrants. In the year ended December 31, 2012, because our ordinary share price increased, the warrant liability increased with a corresponding expense in respect of revaluation of our warrants to fair value. 76 Financial Expenses In the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred $3.4 million of financial expenses, compared to $3.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $0.2 million, or approximately 6.7%. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest on our convertible debentures as a result of a decrease in its variable interest rate. Taxes on Income In the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred $0.5 million of taxes on income, compared to no taxes on income incurred in the year ended December 31, 2011. We incurred $0.6 million tax expense for tax withheld in a foreign jurisdiction, which we may not be able to offset against future taxes and generated $0.1 million of income taxes from deferred tax assets.

Historically, we have funded our operations primarily through cash flow from operations, payments received in connection with strategic partnerships and the issuance of convertible debentures, warrants to purchase our ordinary shares and other equity securities. The balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 totaled $74.1 million, $33.0 million and $33.8 million, respectively. We have certain strategic partnership and distribution agreements under which we receive payments for the achievement of certain milestones. As of December 31, 2013, we received an aggregate of $40.5 million in payments under these agreements, and there are $64.5 million in payments under these agreements that we could potentially receive if we achieve the milestones set forth in such agreements.
