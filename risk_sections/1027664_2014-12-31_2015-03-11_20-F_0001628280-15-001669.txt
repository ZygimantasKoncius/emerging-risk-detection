Risk Factors – General Risks Related to Our Business and Market.)At December 31, 2014, we had outstanding buy-back obligations totaling approximately $930.0 million that extend through 2023.Non-GAAP Financial DataThe following non-GAAP financial data is presented to enable investors to have additional information on our business performance as well as a further basis for periodical comparisons and trends relating to our financial results. We believe such data provides useful information to investors by facilitating more meaningful comparisons of our financial results over time. Such non-GAAP information is used by our management to make strategic decisions, forecast future results and evaluate our current performance. However, investors are cautioned that, unlike financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, non-GAAP measures may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies.The non-GAAP financial data below includes reconciliation adjustments regarding non-GAAP gross profit, operating income, net income and diluted EPS. In arriving at non-GAAP presentations, companies generally factor out items such as those that have a non-recurring impact on the income statements, various non-cash items, significant effects of retroactive tax legislation and changes in accounting guidance and other items which, in management’s judgment, are items that are considered to be outside the review of core operating results. In our non-GAAP presentation, we made certain adjustments as indicated in the table below.These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.48Reconciliation of GAAP (Audited) toNon-GAAP (Unaudited) Supplemental Financial Data(U.S. dollars in millions, except for per share amounts) Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 GAAP gross profit825.1 824.8 815.9Adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets21.7 22.2 24.2Impairment of long-lived assets— 0.9 —Non-GAAP gross profit846.8 847.9 840.1Percent of revenues28.6% 29.0% 29.1% GAAP operating income246.9 239.4 203.1Adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets43.0 45.9 49.3Gain from change in holdings(6.0) — —Legal settlement— (7.6) —Impairment of long-lived assets(1)— 0.9 —Non-GAAP operating income283.9 278.6 252.4Percent of revenues9.6% 9.5% 8.7% GAAP net income attributable to Elbit Systems’ shareholders171.0 183.4 167.9Adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets43.0 45.9 49.3Impairment of long-lived assets(1)— 0.9 —Legal settlement— (7.6) —Gain from changes in holdings(2)(6.0) (0.9) (2.3)Adjustment of loss (gain) from discontinued operations, net— (0.8) 0.4Related tax benefits(6.9) (10.1) (8.9)Non-GAAP net income attributable to Elbit Systems’ shareholders201.1 210.8 206.4Percent of revenues6.8% 7.2% 7.1%Non-GAAP diluted net EPS4.7 5.0 4.9 (1)Impairment of investments in 2013 was due to impairment in intangible assets.(2)Adjustment of gain from changes in holdings includes the income from the sale of investments in affiliated companies of $2.3 million in 2012, a sale of activities of $0.9 million in 2013 and gain of $6.0 million in 2014 relating to an increase in shareholdings in an Israeli subsidiary. 49Item 6.
