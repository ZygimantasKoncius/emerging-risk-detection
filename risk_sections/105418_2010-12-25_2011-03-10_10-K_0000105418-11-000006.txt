Item 1a. Risk Factors: (continued) Changes in tax laws may result in higher income tax. The Company's future effective tax rate may increase from current rates due to changes in laws and the status of pending items with various taxing authorities. Currently, the Company benefits from a combination of its corporate structure and certain state tax laws. The Company is a controlled Company due to the common stock holdings of the Weis family. The Weis family’s share ownership represents approximately 65% of the combined voting power of the Company’s common stock as of December 25, 2010. As a result, the Weis family has the power to elect a majority of the Company’s directors and approve any action requiring the approval of the shareholders of the Company, including adopting certain amendments to the Company’s charter and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of the Company’s assets. Currently, two of the Company’s seven directors are members of the Weis family. Item 1b. Unresolved Staff Comments: There are no unresolved staff comments.
