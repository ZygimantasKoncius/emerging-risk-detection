ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following are risk factors known to us that could affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. We purchase raw materials, commodities and components for use in our production. Increased costs of these materials could have an adverse affect on our production costs if we are unable to pass along price increases or reduce the other cost of goods produced through cost improvement initiatives. Fuel and energy cost increases could also adversely affect our freight and operating costs. We do face through the normal course of business excess and obsolete inventory losses as a result of customer order changes, cancellations, product changes and contract termination. We estimate and reserve for any known or potential impact from these possibilities. The manufacture and sale of our products carries potential risk for product liability claims. We represent and warrant the goods and services we deliver are free from defects in material and workmanship for one year (1) from ship date. Unless otherwise agreed to, workmanship shall be in accordance with IPC and ANSI/J- Standards such as IPC-A-610, class 2, IPCÂ—A-620, class 2, ANSI/J-STD001, class 2, C-20. We make no other guarantees or warranties, expressed or implied, of any nature whatsoever as to the goods including without limitation, warranties to merchantability, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringement of patent or the like unless agreed upon in writing. If a product liability claim results in us being liable and the amount is in excess of our insurance coverage or there is no insurance coverage for the claim then it could have a negative impact on our business and financial position. Our strategy is to grow our business organically and through acquisitions, alliances and joint venture arrangements. In June 2002, we acquired Manufacturing Assembly Solutions of Monterrey, Inc. (MAS), a Mexican corporation, located in Monterrey, Mexico. The benefits of this acquisition has taken more time then expected to integrate into our marketing strategies. 7 ITEM 1B.
