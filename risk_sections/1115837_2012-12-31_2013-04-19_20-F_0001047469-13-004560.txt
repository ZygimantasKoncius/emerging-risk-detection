The dominant reason for the growth of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012, was the large increase in the usage of value-added services by our subscribers (by $440.8 million), which was mainly attributable to the increase of data traffic due to our active promotion of value-added services, the increase of mobile Internet penetration, active 3G network expansion and the consequent improvement of the quality of value-added services.

Moreover, the impairment of our assets in Turkmenistan adversely affected our operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in operating income margin for the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization, cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories as a percentage of our total revenues by 10.8% and 2.5%, respectively. Russia operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 3.8% to $2,776.0 million from $2,674.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The local currencies of these countries fluctuated significantly against the U.S. dollar and euro during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the currency exchange and transaction losses we incurred were primarily due to the translation effect of our U.S. dollar and euro-denominated debt as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. The losses recognized in 2011 as compared to gains recorded in 2010 were mainly due to the depreciation of the Russian ruble and the Uzbek som against the U.S. dollar and euro during the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 2010. Interest expense Consolidated interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by $120.4 million, or 15.5%, to $656.9 million from $777.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in the amount of $60.7 million is due to the decline in amortization of our debt issuance costs. In 2010, the amortization of debt issuance costs was affected by the voluntary repayment of approximately $1.4 billion of our debt balance outstanding as of December 31, 2010, before the due date, which resulted in an immediate write-off of the related debt issuance cost in a total amount of $24.3 million. Additionally, in 2010, we renegotiated the interest rates and maturities of several credit facilities, which led to a significant modification of the related debt agreements and the consequent write-off of capitalized issuance costs totaling $26.4 million. None of the amendments to our credit facilities agreements in 2011 were considered to be substantial, so that no additional expense occurred. The hedging activities in 2011 resulted in an interest expense decrease in the amount of $19.2 million as compared to 2010. The extension of our construction activities in 2011 allowed us to capitalize $8.4 million more interest expense than in 2010. The remaining decrease was due to the decrease in our weighted average interest rate in 2011. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for more information. Equity in net income of associates Consolidated equity in net income of associates for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by $21.2 million, or 30.0%, to a gain of $49.4 million, compared to a gain of $70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Provision for income taxes Consolidated provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by 2.8% to $531.6 million from $517.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 25.3% in the year ended December 31, 2011, from 25.0% in the year ended December 31, 2010. 172 Table of Contents Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2011, amounted to $123.8 million compared to net income attributable to the non-controlling interest of $167.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decline in net income attributable to the non-controlling interest resulted from the increase of our ownership interest in MGTS during the year ended December 31, 2011, from 51.3% to 94.1%. Net income attributable to the Group Net income attributable to the Group for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $63.3 million, or 4.6%, to $1,443.9 million, compared to $1,380.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net income as a percentage of revenues was 11.7% in the year ended December 31, 2011, and 12.2% in the year ended December 31, 2010. Net income attributable to the Group for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, increased mainly due to the effect of the loss from the impairment of our assets in Turkmenistan recognized in the year ended December 31, 2010. B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our borrowings consist of notes and bank loans. Since 2001, we have raised a total of $2.5 billion through seven U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured bond offerings in the international capital markets, as well as ruble-denominated bonds totaling RUB 86 billion (equivalent in aggregate to $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2012). Our bank loans consist of U.S. dollar-, euro- and ruble-denominated borrowings totaling approximately $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2012. We repaid approximately $2,041.8 million of indebtedness in 2012. As of December 31, 2012, the total amount available to us under our credit facilities amounted to $773.2 million. We had total indebtedness of approximately $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2012, including capital lease obligations, compared to approximately $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2011. Our total interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012, was $656.9 million and $ 568.2 million, net of amounts capitalized, respectively. See Note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a description of our indebtedness. Capital Requirements We need capital to finance the following: 혮capital expenditures, consisting of purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; 혮acquisitions; 혮repayment of debt and related interest payments; 혮changes in working capital; and 혮general corporate activities, including dividends. We anticipate that capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of long-term debt and dividends will represent the most significant uses of funds for several years to come. Our cash outlays for capital expenditures in 2010, 2011 and 2012 were $2,647.1 million, 2,584.5 million and $2,902.8 million, respectively. We expect to continue to finance most of our capital expenditure needs through our operating cash flows, and to the extent required, to incur additional indebtedness through borrowings or additional capital raising activities. Historically, a significant portion of our capital expenditures have been related to the installation and build-out of our network and expansion into new license areas. We expect that capital expenditures will remain a large portion of 173 Table of Contents our cash outflows in connection with the continued installation and build-out of our network. We expect our total capital expenditures in 2013 to be approximately 20% of our total 2013 revenue. These investments are required to support the growth in our subscriber base (i.e., to improve network capacity), to maintain and modernize our mobile and fixed line networks, to develop our network in the regions and to commence the LTE deployment and installation in certain key regions as well as the development of our proprietary retail chain in Russia. We expect that the development of LTE networks will be among our most significant capital expenditures and require considerable management resources. See "
