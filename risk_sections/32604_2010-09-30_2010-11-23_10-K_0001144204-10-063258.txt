Item 1A. Risk Factors Investing in our securities involves risks. We may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC in the future. We Operate In Businesses That Are Subject To Competitive Pressures That Could Affect Prices or Demand for Our Products Our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive, and we compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price across the industries and markets served. A significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the best relevant global cost. Some of our competitors have greater sales, assets and financial resources than our Company. Competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products, impacting our profit margins and/or resulting in a loss of market share. Our Operating Results Depend In Part on Continued Successful Research, Development and Marketing of New and/Or Improved Products and Services, and There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue To Successfully Introduce New Products and Services The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. We Engage In Acquisitions, And May Encounter Difficulties in Integrating These Businesses and Therefore We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits Of the Acquisitions We are a company that, from time to time, seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions. In 2010 and in past years, we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business, and may continue to do so in the future (see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2010 Annual Report, which note is hereby incorporated by reference). The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, and in managing strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Access To Funding Through The Capital Markets Is Essential To The Execution Of Our Business Plan And If We Are Unable To Maintain Such Access We Could Experience A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business And Financial Results Our ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. Volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments, or affect the Company’s ability to access those markets. If we are unable to continue to access the capital markets, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. If our customers, suppliers and financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the Company, our business could be adversely impacted. 12 We Use a Variety of Raw Materials and Components in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products Our major requirements for raw materials include steel, copper, cast iron, electronics, aluminum and brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and other petroleum-based chemicals. Emerson has multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one or a few suppliers. Significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations. While we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to reduce price exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results. Our Operations Depend On Production Facilities Throughout The World, A Majority Of Which Are Located Outside The United States And Subject To Increased Risks Of Disrupted Production Causing Delays In Shipments And Loss Of Customers And Revenue We manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, a majority of which are located outside the United States. Emerging market sales now represent over one-third of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our best-cost position. Our international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster, labor strife, war, political unrest, terrorist activity or public health concerns, particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equipped to handle such occurrences. Our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities. Any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us. Our Substantial Sales Abroad Subject Us to Economic Risk As Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected By Foreign Currency Fluctuations and Changes in Local Government Regulations and Policies We sell, manufacture, engineer, and purchase products in overseas markets. A significant portion of our sales is outside the United States, and we expect sales from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales. International sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, and repatriation of earnings. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results. Recessions, Adverse Market Conditions or Downturns in the End Markets We Serve May Negatively Impact Segment Revenues and Operating Results Segment revenues, operating results and cash flows have varied in the past and may be exposed to significant volatility from quarter to quarter in the future due to changes in general economic conditions, recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve. These changes could adversely impact overall sales, operating results and cash flows, which in turn could trigger impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets due to the fair value of such assets falling below the Company’s carrying value. Moreover, during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive rationalization actions and therefore incur higher rationalization expense during such periods. If our rationalization actions are not sufficiently effective or if we must incur rationalization costs beyond what we anticipate, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results. 13 We Are Subject To Litigation and Environmental Regulations That Could Adversely Impact Our Operating Results We are, and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability and environmental matters, several of which claim, or may in the future claim, significant damages. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact. We also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws.
