Item 1A. Risk FactorsThis “Risk Factors” section contains references to our “capital stock” and to our “stockholders.” Unless expressly stated otherwise, the references to our “capital stock” represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock, while the references to our “stockholders” represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock. 13Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Properties and OperationsOur growth will partially depend upon our ability to successfully acquire future properties, and we may be unable to enter into and consummate property acquisitions on advantageous terms or our property acquisitions may not perform as we expect.We acquire and intend to continue to acquire primarily freestanding, single tenant retail properties net leased primarily to investment grade and other credit tenants The acquisition of properties entails various risks, including the risks that our investments may not perform as we expect, that we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate our new acquisitions into our existing operations and that our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. Further, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other well capitalized real estate investors, including both publicly-traded REITs and private institutional investment funds, including ARC and its affiliates and other REITs and funds sponsored or advised by ARC or its affiliates, and these competitors may have greater financial resources than us and a greater ability to borrow funds and acquire properties. This competition increases as investments in real estate become increasingly attractive relative to other forms of investment. As a result of competition, we may be unable to acquire additional properties as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly elevated. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or our operating partnership or its subsidiaries and proceeds from property contributions and divestitures which may not be available and which could adversely affect our cash flows. Any of the above risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay distributions on, and the market price of, our common stock.In addition, our growth strategy includes the disciplined acquisition of properties as opportunities arise. Our ability to acquire properties on satisfactory terms and successfully integrate and operate them is subject to the following significant risks:•we may be unable to acquire desired properties because of competition from other real estate investors with more capital, including other real estate operating companies, REITs and investment funds;•we may acquire properties that are not accretive to our results upon acquisition, and we may not successfully manage and lease those properties to meet our expectations;•competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price of a desired property;•we may be unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, or obtain the necessary debt or equity financing to consummate an acquisition or, if obtainable, financing may not be on satisfactory terms;•we may need to spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties;•agreements for the acquisition of properties are typically subject to customary conditions to closing, including satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations, and we may spend significant time and money on potential acquisitions that we do not consummate;•the process of acquiring or pursuing the acquisition of a new property may divert the attention of our Manager from our existing business operations;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations;•market conditions may result in future vacancies and lower-than-expected rental rates; and•we may acquire properties without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, for liabilities, whether known or unknown, such as cleanup of environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.If we cannot complete property acquisitions on favorable terms, or operate acquired properties to meet our goals or expectations, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make dividends to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected.14Table of ContentsWe may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for dividend to our stockholders, per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.Because we compete with a number of real estate operators in connection with the leasing of our properties, the possibility exists that one or more of our tenants will extend or renew its lease with us when the lease term expires on terms that are less favorable to us than the terms of the then-expiring lease, or that such tenant or tenants will not renew at all. Because we depend, in large part, on rental payments from our tenants, if one or more tenants renews its lease on terms less favorable to us, does not renew its lease or we do not re-lease a significant portion of the space made available, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for dividend to our stockholders, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.We are dependent on single-tenant leases for our revenue and, accordingly, lease terminations or tenant defaults could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We focus our investment activities on ownership of freestanding, single-tenant commercial properties that are net leased to a single tenant. Therefore, the financial failure of, or other default in payment by, a single tenant under its lease is likely to cause a significant reduction in our operating cash flows from that property and a significant reduction in the value of the property, and could cause a significant reduction in our revenues. If a lease is terminated or defaulted on, we may experience difficulty or significant delay in re-leasing such property, or we may be unable to find a new tenant to re-lease the vacated space, which could result in us incurring a loss. The current economic conditions may put financial pressure on and increase the likelihood of the financial failure of, or other default in payment by, one or more of the tenants to whom we have exposure.The failure by any major tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us, because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise, or the termination or non-renewal of a lease by a major tenant, would have a material adverse effect on us.Our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our tenants. While we evaluate the creditworthiness of our tenants by reviewing available financial and other pertinent information, there can be no assurance that any tenant will be able to make timely rental payments or avoid defaulting under its lease. At any time, our tenants may experience an adverse change in their business. For example, the recent downturn in the global economy already may have adversely affected, or may in the future adversely affect, one or more of our tenants. If any of our tenants' business experience significant adverse changes, they may decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close a number of stores, exercise early termination rights (to the extent such rights are available to the tenant) or declare bankruptcy. If a tenant defaults, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment.If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could result in the termination of the tenant's leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases. If a lease is terminated or defaulted on, we may be unable to find a new tenant to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. Furthermore, the consequences to us would be exacerbated if one of our major tenants were to experience an adverse development in their business that resulted in them being unable to make timely rental payments or to default under their lease. The occurrence of any of the situations described above would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.15Table of ContentsWe rely significantly on eight major tenants (including, for this purpose, all affiliates of such tenants) and therefore, are subject to tenant credit concentrations that make us more susceptible to adverse events with respect to those tenants.As of December 31, 2012, the following eight major tenants had annualized rental income on a straight-line basis, which represented 5% or more of our total annualized rental income on a straight-line basis including for this purpose, all affiliates of such tenants: •Citizens Bank represented 28.7% of total annualized rental income; •U.S. General Services Administration ("GSA") represented 11.6% of total annualized rental income; •John Deere represented 10.0% of total annualized rental income; •Home Depot represented 9.6% of total annualized rental income; •Advance Auto represented 7.2% of total annualized rental income; •Dollar General represented 6.8% of total annualized rental income; •FedEx represented 5.9% of total annualized rental income; and •Walgreens represented 5.1% of total annualized rental income.On a pro forma basis, as of December 31, 2012, the following five major tenants had annualized rental income on a straight-line basis, which represented 5% or more of pro forma total annualized rental income on a straight-line basis including for this purpose, all affiliates of such tenants: •Dollar General represented 12.3% of total annualized rental income; •Citizens Bank represented 11.8% of total annualized rental income; •FedEx represented 10.2% of total annualized rental income; •AON Corporation represented 7.5% of total annualized rental income; and •Walgreens represented 6.2% of total annualized rental income.Therefore, the financial failure of a major tenant is likely to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the value of the investment is historically driven by the credit quality of the underlying tenant, and an adverse change in a major tenant's financial condition or a decline in the credit rating of such tenant may result in a decline in the value of the investments and have a material adverse effect on the results from operations. We are subject to tenant geographic concentrations that make us more susceptible to adverse events with respect to certain geographic areas. We are subject to geographic concentrations, the most significant of which are the following as of December 31, 2012: •approximately $3.6 million, or 15.2%, of our annualized rental income came from properties located in Michigan; •approximately $2.5 million, or 10.8%, of our annualized rental income came from properties located in Ohio; •approximately $2.5 million, or 10.6%, of our annualized rental income came from properties located in South Carolina; •approximately $2.4 million, or 10.0%, of our annualized rental income came from properties located in Iowa; •approximately $2.2 million, or 9.5%, of our annualized rental income came from properties located in New York; •approximately $1.2 million, or 5.2%, of our annualized rental income came from properties located in Missouri; and •approximately $1.2 million, or 5.1%, of our annualized rental income came from properties located in Illinois.As of December 31, 2012, our tenants operated in 26 states. Any downturn in one or more of these states, or in any other state in which we may have a significant credit concentration in the future, could result in a material reduction of our cash flows or material losses to the Company.16Table of ContentsOn a pro forma basis, we and ARCT III combined are subject to tenant geographic concentrations that make us more susceptible to adverse events with respect to certain geographic areas. We and ARCT III combined are subject to geographic concentrations, the most significant of which are the following as of December 31, 2012: •approximately $16.3 million, or 11.2%, of our annualized rental income came from properties located in Illinois; •approximately $8.8 million, or 6.0%, of our annualized rental income came from properties located in Missouri; •approximately $7.9 million, or 5.4%, of our annualized rental income came from properties located in Ohio; •approximately $7.7 million, or 5.3%, of our annualized rental income came from properties located in Michigan; and •approximately $7.5 million, or 5.2%, of our annualized rental income came from properties located in North Carolina.As of December 31, 2012, our combined tenants operated in 44 states. Any downturn in one or more of these states, or in any other state in which we and ARCT III may have a significant credit concentration in the future, could result in a material reduction of our combined cash flows or material losses to the Company on a combined basis.Our net leases may require us to pay property-related expenses that are not the obligations of our tenants.Under the terms of the majority of our net leases, in addition to satisfying their rent obligations, our tenants are responsible for the payment of real estate taxes, insurance and ordinary maintenance and repairs. However, under the provisions of certain leases and leases we may have in the future with our tenants, we may be required to pay some expenses, such as the costs of environmental liabilities, roof and structural repairs, insurance, certain non-structural repairs and maintenance. If our properties incur significant expenses that must be paid by us under the terms of our leases, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected and the amount of cash available to meet expenses and to make dividends to holders of our capital stock may be reduced.Net leases may not result in fair market lease rates over time, which could negatively impact our income and reduce the amount of funds available to make distributions to you.The vast majority of our rental income comes from net leases, which generally provide the tenant greater discretion in using the leased property than ordinary property leases, such as the right to freely sublease the property, to make alterations in the leased premises and to terminate the lease prior to its expiration under specified circumstances. Furthermore, net leases typically have longer lease terms and, thus, there is an increased risk that contractual rental increases in future years will fail to result in fair market rental rates during those years. As a result, our income and distributions to our stockholders could be lower than they would otherwise be if we did not engage in net leases.Long-term leases with tenants may not result in fair value over time. Long-term leases do not allow for significant changes in rental payments and do not expire in the near term. If we do not accurately judge the potential for increases in market rental rates when negotiating these long-term leases, significant increases in future property operating costs could result in receiving less than fair value from these leases. These circumstances would adversely affect our revenues and funds available for distribution.Any of our properties that incurs a vacancy could be difficult to sell or re-lease.One or more of our properties may incur a vacancy either by the continued default of a tenant under its lease or the expiration of one of our leases. Certain of our properties may be specifically suited to the particular needs of a tenant (e.g., a retail bank branch or distribution warehouse) and major renovations and expenditures may be required in order for us to re-lease vacant space for other uses. We may have difficulty obtaining a new tenant for any vacant space we have in our properties, including our presently vacant property. If the vacancy continues for a long period of time, we may suffer reduced revenues resulting in less cash available to be distributed to stockholders. In addition, the resale value of a property could be diminished because the market value of a particular property will depend principally upon the value of the leases of such property.17Table of ContentsWe are subject to tenant industry concentrations that make us more susceptible to adverse events with respect to certain industries.As of December 31, 2012, our tenants operate in eleven industries and on a pro forma basis will operate in 19 industries. Any downturn in one or more of these industries, or in any other industry in which we may have a significant credit concentration in the future, could result in a material reduction of our cash flows or material losses to our company.Our properties may be subject to impairment charges.We periodically evaluate our real estate investments for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions, tenant performance and legal structure. For example, the early termination of, or default under, a lease by a tenant may lead to an impairment charge. Since our investment focus is on properties net leased to a single tenant, the financial failure of, or other default in payment by, a single tenant under its lease may result in a significant impairment loss. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the property, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and FFO in the period in which the impairment charge is recorded.Our real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and therefore we may not be able to dispose of properties when appropriate or on favorable terms.The real estate investments made, and to be made, by us are relatively difficult to sell quickly. Return of capital and realization of gains, if any, from an investment generally will occur upon disposition or refinancing of a property. In addition, the Code imposes restrictions on the ability of a REIT to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. We may be unable to realize our investment objectives by disposition or refinancing of a property at attractive prices within any given period of time or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy. In particular, these risks could arise from weakness in or even the lack of an established market for a property, changes in the financial condition or prospects of prospective purchasers, changes in national or international economic conditions, and changes in laws, regulations or fiscal policies of jurisdictions in which the property is located.Our investments in properties backed by below investment grade credits will have a greater risk of default.As of December 31, 2012, 3% of our annualized rental income come and on a pro forma basis 22% of our annualized rental income is derived from tenants who do not have credit ratings or are rated below investment grade by a major rating agency. We also may invest in other properties in the future where the underlying tenant's credit rating is below investment grade. These investments will have a greater risk of default and bankruptcy than investments in properties leased exclusively to investment grade tenants.Our investments in properties where the underlying tenant does not have a publicly available credit rating will expose us to certain risks.When we invest in properties where the underlying tenant does not have a publicly available credit rating, we will rely on our own estimates of the tenant's credit rating and usually subsequently obtain a private rating from a reputable credit rating agency to allow us to finance the property as we had planned. If our lender or a credit rating agency disagrees with our ratings estimates, or our ratings estimates are inaccurate, we may not be able to obtain our desired level of leverage or our financing costs may exceed those that we projected. This outcome could have an adverse impact on our returns on that asset and hence our operating results.Dividends paid from sources other than our cash flow from operations, particularly from proceeds of financings, will result in us having fewer funds available for the acquisition of properties and other real estate-related investments and may dilute your interests in us, which may adversely affect our ability to fund future dividends with cash flow from operations and may adversely affect your overall return. Our cash flows provided by operations were $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our dividends paid of $8.4 million was funded from $6.1 million of cash flow provided by operations and $2.5 million from proceeds of financings. Additionally, we may in the future pay dividends from sources other than from our cash flow from operations.18Table of ContentsUntil we acquire additional properties or other real estate-related investments, we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to pay dividends. Our inability to acquire additional properties or other real estate-related investments may result in a lower return on your investment than you expect. If we have not generated sufficient cash flow from our operations and other sources, such as from borrowings, the sale of additional securities, advances from our Sponsor, and/or our Manager's deferral, suspension and/or waiver of its fees and expense reimbursements, to fund distributions, we may use the proceeds from offerings of securities. Moreover, our board of directors may change our dividend distribution policy, in its sole discretion, at any time. Dividends made from offering proceeds are a return of capital to stockholders, from which we will have already paid offering expenses in connection with the applicable offering. We have not established any limit on the amount of proceeds from an offering that may be used to fund dividends, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make dividend distributions that would: (1) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; (2) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences; or (3) jeopardize our ability to qualify as a REIT. If we fund dividends from the proceeds of offerings of securities, we will have less funds available for acquiring properties or other real estate-related investments. As a result, the return you realize on your investment may be reduced. Funding dividends from borrowings could restrict the amount we can borrow for investments, which may affect our profitability. Funding dividends with the sale of assets or the proceeds of offerings of securities may affect our ability to generate cash flows. Funding dividends from the sale of additional securities could dilute your interest in us if we sell shares of our common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into shares of our common stock to third party investors. Payment of dividends from the mentioned sources could restrict our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, affect our profitability and/or affect the dividends payable to you upon a liquidity event, any or all of which may have an adverse effect on your investment.We disclose adjusted funds from operations ("AFFO"), a non-GAAP financial measure, including in documents filed with the SEC; however, AFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and you should consider GAAP measures to be more relevant to our operating performance.We use and disclose to investors AFFO, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See ''Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations.'' AFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined in accordance with GAAP, and investors should consider GAAP measures to be more relevant to evaluating our operating performance. AFFO and GAAP net income differ because AFFO excludes gains and losses from the sale of property, plus depreciation and amortization, merger related costs, acquisition-related fees and expenses and other non cash charges. Because of the differences between AFFO and GAAP net income or loss, AFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which we are acquiring properties. In addition, AFFO is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and investors should not consider AFFO as an alternative to cash flows from operations, as an indication of our liquidity, or as indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.Neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate AFFO. Also, because not all companies calculate AFFO the same way, comparisons with other companies may not be meaningful.Operating expenses of our properties will reduce our cash flow and funds available for future distributions.For certain of our properties, we are responsible for operating costs of the property. In some of these instances, our leases require the tenant to reimburse us for all or a portion of these costs, either in the form of an expense reimbursement or increased rent. Our reimbursement may be limited to a fixed amount or a specified percentage annually. To the extent operating costs exceed our reimbursement, our returns and net cash flows from the property and hence our overall operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.We have greater exposure to operating costs when we invest in properties leased to the GSA. We invest in properties leased to the GSA. As of December 31, 2012, 11.6% of our total annualized rental income was attributable to leases with the GSA. Such leases with the GSA are typical GSA-type leases. These leases do not provide that the GSA is wholly responsible for operating costs of the property, but include an operating cost component within the rent we receive that increases annually by an agreed-upon percentage based upon the Consumer Price Index (the "CPI"). Thus, we will have greater exposure to operating costs on our properties leased to the GSA because if the operating costs of the property increase faster than the CPI, we will bear those excess costs. 19Table of ContentsWe would face potential adverse effects from tenant defaults, bankruptcies or insolvencies.The bankruptcy of our tenants may adversely affect the income generated by our properties. If our tenant files for bankruptcy, we generally cannot evict the tenant solely because of such bankruptcy. In addition, a bankruptcy court could authorize a bankrupt tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. In such a case, our claim against the tenant for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and it is unlikely that a bankrupt tenant would pay in full amounts it owes us under the lease. Any shortfall resulting from the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.The price we paid for the assets we acquired in the formation transactions, all of which were purchased from the Contributor, an affiliate of our Sponsor, may have exceeded their aggregate fair market value.The amount of consideration we paid the Contributor, an affiliate of our Sponsor, for the 63 properties we acquired in our formation transactions, as determined by an independent third-party investment valuation, may have been greater than the value of such properties, because the amount of consideration for such properties was not determined as a result of arm’s-length negotiations. Further, we have not obtained a recent appraisal of the fair market value of the properties nor solicited third-party bids for the properties for purposes of creating a market check on their value. Conflicts of interest existed in connection with the transaction in which interests in these properties were contributed to our operating partnership. There can be no assurance that the values reflected in the independent third-party investment valuation that we obtained reflect the fair market value of the properties were they to be sold in an arm’s-length transaction. As a result, the price paid by us for the acquisition of the assets in the formation transactions may have exceeded the fair market value of those assets. The aggregate historical combined net book value of the real estate assets acquired by us in the formation transactions was $109.5 million. We have assumed, and expect in the future to continue to assume, liabilities in connection with our property acquisitions, including unknown liabilities. As part of the formation transactions, we assumed existing liabilities of our initial property subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, liabilities in connection with our initial properties, some of which may have been unknown or unquantifiable at the time the formation transactions were consummated. In addition, we have assumed existing liabilities related to our subsequent property acquisitions, and expect in the future to continue to assume existing liabilities related to our property acquisitions. Unknown liabilities might include liabilities for cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, claims of tenants or other persons dealing with the sellers prior to our acquisition of the properties, tax liabilities, employment-related issues, and accrued but unpaid liabilities whether incurred in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. If the magnitude of such unknown liabilities is high, either singly or in the aggregate, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders.We face intense competition, which may decrease or prevent increases in the occupancy and rental rates of our properties.We compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of retail, industrial and office real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. If one of our properties becomes vacant and our competitors (which would include ARC or any ARC-sponsored program ("ARC Fund")) offer space at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose existing or potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge or to offer substantial rent abatements. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected.Our operating performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.Our real estate investments are subject to various risks and fluctuations and cycles in value and demand, many of which are beyond our control. Certain events may decrease cash available for dividends, as well as the value of our properties. These events include, but are not limited to:•adverse changes in international, national or local economic and demographic conditions such as the recent global economic downturn;•vacancies or our inability to rent space on favorable terms, including possible market pressures to offer tenants rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or tenant-favorable renewal options;20Table of Contents•adverse changes in financial conditions of buyers, sellers and tenants of properties;•inability to collect rent from tenants;•competition from other real estate investors with significant capital, including other real estate operating companies, REITs and institutional investment funds;•reductions in the level of demand for commercial space generally, and freestanding net leased properties specifically, and changes in the relative popularity of our properties;•increases in the supply of freestanding single-tenant properties;•fluctuations in interest rates, which could adversely affect our ability, or the ability of buyers and tenants of our properties, to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;•increases in expenses, including, but not limited to, insurance costs, labor costs, energy prices, real estate assessments and other taxes and costs of compliance with laws, regulations and governmental policies, all of which have an adverse impact on the rent a tenant may be willing to pay us in order to lease one or more of our properties; and•changes in, and changes in enforcement of, laws, regulations and governmental policies, including, without limitation, health, safety, environmental, zoning and tax laws, governmental fiscal policies and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession, such as the recent global economic downturn, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults under existing leases. If we cannot operate our properties to meet our financial expectations, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make dividends to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our return objectives.A potential change in U.S. accounting standards regarding operating leases may make the leasing of our properties less attractive to our potential tenants, which could reduce overall demand for our leasing services.Under current authoritative accounting guidance for leases, a lease is classified by a tenant as a capital lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered to reside with the tenant. Under capital lease accounting for a tenant, both the leased asset and liability are reflected on their balance sheet. If the lease does not meet any of the criteria for a capital lease, the lease is considered an operating lease by the tenant, and the obligation does not appear on the tenant's balance sheet; rather, the contractual future minimum payment obligations are only disclosed in the footnotes thereto. Thus, entering into an operating lease can appear to enhance a tenant's balance sheet in comparison to direct ownership. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board, or the IASB, conducted a joint project to re-evaluate lease accounting. In August 2010, the FASB and the IASB jointly released exposure drafts of a proposed accounting model that would significantly change lease accounting. Based on comments received, it was announced in January 2013 that a revised Exposure is expected to be released in the second quarter of 2013. Changes to the accounting guidance could affect both our accounting for leases as well as that of our current and potential tenants. These changes may affect how our real estate leasing business is conducted. For example, if the accounting standards regarding the financial statement classification of operating leases are revised, then companies may be less willing to enter into leases with us in general or desire to enter into leases with us with shorter terms because the apparent benefits to their balance sheets could be reduced or eliminated. This in turn could make it more difficult for us to enter into leases on terms we find favorable.We will rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs, and if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital, we may not be able to make future acquisitions necessary to grow our business or meet maturing obligations.In order to qualify as a REIT under the Code, we will be required, among other things, to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. Because of this dividend requirement, we may not be able to fund, from cash retained from operations, all of our future capital needs, including capital needed to make investments and to satisfy or refinance maturing obligations.21Table of ContentsWe expect to rely on external sources of capital, including debt and equity financing, to fund future capital needs. However, the recent U.S. and global economic slowdown has resulted in a capital environment characterized by limited availability, increasing costs and significant volatility. If we are unable to obtain needed capital on satisfactory terms or at all, we may not be able to make the investments needed to expand our business, or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature.Any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage. Our access to capital will depend upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including:•general market conditions;•the market's perception of our growth potential;•our current debt levels;•our current and expected future earnings;•our cash flow and cash dividends; and•the market price per share of our common stock.We may not be in a position to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities for growth if we are unable to access the capital markets on a timely basis on favorable terms.Our ability to sell equity to expand our business will depend, in part, on the market price of our common stock, and our failure to meet market expectations with respect to our business could negatively affect the market price of our common stock and limit our ability to sell equity.The availability of equity capital to us will depend, in part, on the market price of our common stock, which, in turn, will depend upon various market conditions and other factors that may change from time to time, including:•the extent of investor interest;•our ability to satisfy the dividend requirements applicable to REITs;•the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies;•our financial performance and that of our tenants;•analyst reports about us and the REIT industry;•general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed-income securities, which may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends;•a failure to maintain or increase our dividend, which is dependent, to a large part, on FFO, which, in turn, depends upon increased revenue from additional acquisitions and rental increases; and•other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in REIT tax laws.Our failure to meet market expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, as a result, the availability of equity capital to us.We have substantial amounts of indebtedness outstanding, which may affect our ability to make dividends, may expose us to interest rate fluctuation risk and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.As of December 31, 2012, our aggregate indebtedness was approximately $160.4 million and on a pro forma basis is expected to be approximately $1.0 billion. We may incur significant additional debt for various purposes including, without limitation, the funding of future acquisitions, capital improvements and leasing commissions in connection with the repositioning of a property.22Table of ContentsPayments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to make the dividends currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. Our substantial outstanding indebtedness, and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements, could have other significant adverse consequences, including as follows:•our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;•we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on satisfactory terms, which could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to capitalize upon emerging acquisition opportunities or meet needs to fund capital improvements and leasing commissions;•we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;•we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms;•we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations;•certain of the property subsidiaries' loan documents may include restrictions on such subsidiary's ability to make dividends to us;•we may be unable to hedge floating-rate debt, counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under our hedge agreements, these agreements may not effectively hedge interest rate fluctuation risk, and, upon the expiration of any hedge agreements, we would be exposed to then-existing market rates of interest and future interest rate volatility;•we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases; and•our default under any of our indebtedness with cross-default provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness.If any one of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make dividends to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any foreclosure on our properties could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, which could adversely affect our ability to meet the REIT dividend requirements imposed by the Code.Our existing loan agreements contain, and future financing arrangements will likely contain, restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.We are subject to certain restrictions pursuant to the restrictive covenants of our outstanding indebtedness, which may affect our dividend and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt. Loan documents evidencing our existing indebtedness contain, and loan documents entered into in the future will likely contain, certain operating covenants that limit our ability to further mortgage the property or discontinue insurance coverage. In addition, future agreements may contain, and any future company credit facilities likely will contain, financial covenants, including certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt, make dividends, sell all or substantially all of our assets, and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. Specifically, our ability to make dividends may be limited by the New Credit Facility, pursuant to which our dividends may not exceed the greater of (i) 95.0% of our AFFO or (ii) the amount required for us to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT. Covenants under any future indebtedness may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions. In addition, failure to meet any of these covenants, including the financial coverage ratios, could cause an event of default under or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us.Increases in interest rates would increase the amount of our variable-rate debt payments and could limit our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.Indebtedness under the new credit facility is subject to, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future subject to, floating interest rates, and as a result, increases in interest rates on such indebtedness would reduce our cash flows and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. In addition, if we are required to repay existing debt during periods of higher interest rates, we may need to sell one or more of our investments in order to repay the debt, which might reduce the realization of the return on such investments.23Table of ContentsOur organizational documents have no limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. As a result, we may become highly leveraged in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition.Our business strategy contemplates the use of both secured and unsecured debt to finance long-term growth. While we intend to limit our indebtedness to maintain an overall net debt to gross asset value of approximately 45% to 55%, provided that we may exceed this amount for individual properties in select cases where attractive financing is available, our governing documents contain no limitations on the amount of debt that we may incur, and our board of directors may change our financing policy at any time without stockholder approval. As a result, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could result in an increase in our debt service and harm our financial condition.The continued recovery of real estate markets from the recent recession is dependent upon forecasted moderate economic growth, which if significantly slower than expected could have a negative impact on the performance of our investment portfolio.The U.S. economy is in its third year of recovery from a severe global recession and the commercial real estate markets stabilized and began to recover in 2011. Based on moderate economic growth in the future, and historically low levels of new supply in the commercial real estate pipeline, a stronger recovery is forecasted for all property sectors over the next two years. Nevertheless, this ongoing economic recovery remains fragile, and could be slowed or halted by significant external events. As a result, real estate markets could perform lower than expected as a result of reduced tenant demand. A severe weakening of the economy or a renewed recession could also lead to higher tenancy default and vacancy rates, which could create an oversupply of rentable space, increased property concessions and tenant improvement expenditures and reduced rental rates to maintain occupancies. There can be no assurance that our real estate investments will not be adversely impacted by a severe slowing of the economy or renewed recession. Tenant defaults, fluctuations in interest rates, limited availability of capital and other economic conditions beyond our control could negatively impact our portfolio, and decrease the value of your investment.Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows, and there can be no assurance as to future costs and the scope of coverage that may be available under insurance policies.We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket insurance policy with policy specifications, limits and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties. In addition, we carry professional liability and directors' and officers' insurance. We have selected policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. We do not carry insurance for certain losses, including, but not limited to, losses caused by riots or war. Certain types of losses may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, such as losses due to earthquakes, riots or acts of war. Should an uninsured loss occur, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property. If any such loss is insured, we may be required to pay a significant deductible on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss, or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss. In addition, future lenders may require such insurance, and our failure to obtain such insurance could constitute a default under our loan agreements. In addition, we may reduce or discontinue terrorism, earthquake, flood or other insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any of these policies exceeds, in our judgment, the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss. Our title insurance policies may not insure for the current aggregate market value of our portfolio, and we do not intend to increase our title insurance coverage as the market value of our portfolio increases. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make dividends to our stockholders may be materially and adversely affected.If we or one or more of our tenants experiences a loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.If any of our insurance carriers becomes insolvent, we could be adversely affected.We carry several different lines of insurance, placed with several large insurance carriers. If any one of these large insurance carriers were to become insolvent, we would be forced to replace the existing insurance coverage with another suitable carrier, and any outstanding claims would be at risk for collection. In such an event, we cannot be certain that we would be able to replace the coverage at similar or otherwise favorable terms. Replacing insurance coverage at unfavorable rates and the potential of uncollectible claims due to carrier insolvency could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.24Table of ContentsTerrorism and other factors affecting demand for our properties could harm our operating results.The strength and profitability of our business depends on demand for and the value of our properties. Future terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the attacks that occurred in New York and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001, and other acts of terrorism or war could have a negative impact on our operations. Such terrorist attacks could have an adverse impact on our business even if they are not directed at our properties. In addition, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 have substantially affected the availability and price of insurance coverage for certain types of damages or occurrences, and our insurance policies for terrorism include large deductibles and co-payments. The lack of sufficient insurance for these types of acts could expose us to significant losses and could have a negative impact on our operations.We may be required to make significant capital expenditures to improve our properties in order to retain and attract tenants, causing a decline in operating revenue and reducing cash available for debt service and distributions to stockholders.Upon expiration of leases at our properties, we may be required to make rent or other concessions to tenants, or accommodate requests for renovations, build-to-suit remodeling and other improvements. As a result, we may have to make significant capital or other expenditures in order to retain tenants whose leases expire and to attract new tenants. Additionally, we may need to raise capital to make such expenditures. If we are unable to do so or capital is otherwise unavailable, we may be unable to make the required expenditures. This could result in non-renewals by tenants upon expiration of their leases, which would result in declines in revenue from operations and reduce cash available for debt service and dividends to stockholders.Difficult conditions in the commercial real estate markets may cause us to experience market losses related to our holdings, and these conditions may not improve in the near future.Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the real estate markets, the financial markets and the economy generally and may cause commercial real estate values, including the values of our properties, and market rental rates, including rental rates that we are able to charge, to decline significantly. Recent economic and credit market conditions have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for real estate markets, as well as adversely impacted inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues and the availability and cost of credit, and may continue to do so going forward. The further deterioration of the real estate market may cause us to record losses on our assets, reduce the proceeds we receive upon sale or refinance of our assets or adversely impact our ability to lease our properties. Declines in the market values of our properties may adversely affect our results of operations and credit availability, which may reduce earnings and, in turn, cash available for dividends to our stockholders. Economic and credit market conditions may also cause one or more of the tenants to whom we have exposure to fail or default in their payment obligations, which could cause us to record material losses or a material reduction in our cash flows.Because we own real property, we are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.Environmental laws regulate, and impose liability for, releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Under various provisions of these laws, an owner or operator of real estate, such as us, is or may be liable for costs related to soil or groundwater contamination on, in, or migrating to or from its property. In addition, persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination at the disposal site. Such laws often impose liability regardless of whether the person knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances that caused the contamination. The presence of, or contamination resulting from, any of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate them, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our property or to borrow using such property as collateral. In addition, persons exposed to hazardous or toxic substances may sue us for personal injury damages. For example, certain laws impose liability for release of or exposure to asbestos-containing materials and contamination from past operations or from off-site sources. As a result, in connection with our current or former ownership, operation, management and development of real properties, we may be potentially liable for investigation and cleanup costs, penalties, and damages under environmental laws.Although all of our properties were, at the time they were acquired by our predecessor, subjected to preliminary environmental assessments, known as Phase I assessments, by independent environmental consultants that identify certain liabilities, Phase I assessments are limited in scope, and may not include or identify all potential environmental liabilities or risks associated with the property. Further, any environmental liabilities that arose since the date the studies were done would not be identified in the assessments. Unless required by applicable laws or regulations, we may not further investigate, remedy or ameliorate the liabilities disclosed in the Phase I assessments.25Table of ContentsWe cannot assure you that these or other environmental studies identified all potential environmental liabilities, or that we will not incur material environmental liabilities in the future. If we do incur material environmental liabilities in the future, we may face significant remediation costs, and we may find it difficult to sell any affected properties.As a result of becoming a public company, we implemented additional financial and accounting systems, procedures and controls which are applicable to such companies, which has increased our costs and requires substantial management time and attention.As a public company, we have incurred, and in the future will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses that our predecessor did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements and corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As an example, in order to comply with such reporting requirements, we are evaluating our internal control systems in order to allow management to report on, and, when required, our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail to implement proper overall business controls, including as required to integrate the property subsidiaries and support our growth, our results of operations could be harmed or we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, if we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, or if we are unable to receive an unqualified report from our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our internal control over financial reporting when required, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and the trading price of our common stock and our ability to obtain any necessary equity or debt financing could suffer.Furthermore, the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements, or misrepresentations. Although management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weaknesses, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in the trading price of our common stock, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.Payment of fees to the Manager reduces cash available for investment and distribution. Our Manager manages our day to day business and properties. Our Manager is paid substantial fees for these services, which reduce the amount of cash available for investment in properties or distribution to stockholders. Such fees and reimbursements include: (i) a management fee payable equal to 0.50% per annum of our average unadjusted book value of our real estate assets up to $3.0 billion and 0.40% per annum of such average unadjusted book value in excess of $3.0 billion, calculated and payable monthly in advance; (ii) incentive fees equal to the difference between (1) the product of (x) 20% and (y) the difference between (I) our Core Earnings (as defined below) for the previous 12-month period, and (II) the product of (A) the weighted average of the issue price per share of our common stock of all of our public offerings of common stock multiplied by the weighted average number of all shares of our common stock outstanding (including any restricted shares of common stock and other shares of common stock underlying awards granted under one or more of our equity incentive plans) in the previous 12-month period, and (B) 8.00%, and (2) the sum of any incentive fee paid to our Manager with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such previous 12-month period; provided, however, that no incentive fee is payable with respect to any calendar quarter unless Core Earnings for the 12 most recently completed calendar quarters is greater than zero; and (iii) reimbursement for all out-of-pocket costs actually incurred by our Manager in connection with the performance of services under the management agreement, including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses, travel and communications expenses, brokerage fees, costs of appraisals, nonrefundable option payments on property not acquired, accounting fees and expenses, title insurance premiums and the costs of performing due diligence. For the purpose of calculating incentive fees, “Core Earnings” means the net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) incentive compensation, (iii) acquisition fees, (iv) financing fees, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) any unrealized gains or losses or other non-cash items that are included in net income for the applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income, and (vii) one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and certain non-cash charges, in each case after discussions between our Manager and the independent members of our board of directors and approved by a majority of such independent members of the board of directors.We may use some of the proceeds from future equity offerings to repay indebtedness owed to affiliates or incurred pursuant to affiliated debt programs.To the extent we borrow money from affiliates or pursuant to affiliated debt programs in the future, we may use proceeds from future equity offerings to repay such indebtedness.26Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Relationship with Our Manager and ARCWe are dependent on ARC and its key personnel, especially Messrs. Schorsch, Budko, Block and Weil, who provide services to us through the management agreement, and we may not find a suitable replacement for our Manager if the management agreement is terminated, or for these key personnel if they leave ARC or otherwise become unavailable to us.We have no separate facilities and are completely reliant on our Manager and ARC. Our chief executive officer, our president, our executive vice president and chief investment officer and our executive vice president and chief financial officer are executives of ARC. Our Manager and ARC have significant discretion as to the implementation of our investment and operating policies and strategies. Accordingly, we believe that our success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts, experience, diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the officers and key personnel of our Manager and ARC. The officers and key personnel of our Manager and ARC will evaluate, negotiate, close and monitor our investments; therefore, our success will depend on their continued service. The departure of any of the officers or key personnel of our Manager could have a material adverse effect on our performance and slow our future growth. We have not obtained and do not expect to obtain “key person” life insurance on any of our key personnel. Neither our Manager nor ARC is obligated to dedicate any specific personnel exclusively to us. In addition, none of our officers or the officers of our Manager or ARC are obligated to dedicate any specific portion of their time to our business. In addition, we offer no assurance that our Manager will remain our investment manager or that we will continue to have access to ARC to provide us with acquisition and capital services. The initial term of our management agreement with our Manager extends until September 6, 2021, which is the tenth anniversary of the closing of our IPO, with automatic one-year renewals thereafter, subject to a 180-day prior written notice of termination period. The acquisition and capital services agreement with ARC will be terminated concurrently with the consummation of the Merger.If the management agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found to provide the services needed by us under such agreement, or our new employees hired in connection with the Internalization are ineffective, we may not be able to execute our business plan. There are various conflicts of interest in our relationship with ARC and our Manager, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.We are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with ARC and our Manager. Specifically, Mr. Schorsch, our chief executive officer and the chairman of our board of directors, Mr. Weil, our president, chief operating officer, secretary and one of our Directors, Mr. Budko, our executive vice president and chief investment officer, and Mr. Block, our executive vice president and chief financial officer, are executives of ARC. Our Manager and executive officers may have conflicts between their duties to us and their duties to, and interests in, ARC and other ARC Funds. ARC and its affiliates sponsor and manage numerous other public REITs that invest in real estate assets, including REITs focused on net leased properties.Our board of directors has adopted a policy with respect to any proposed investments by our directors or officers or the officers of our Manager, which we refer to as the covered persons, in our target properties. This policy provides that any proposed investment by a covered person for his or her own account in any of our target properties will be permitted if the capital required for the investment does not exceed the lesser of (i) $5 million, or (ii)1% of our total stockholders' equity as of the most recent month end, or the personal investment limit. To the extent that a proposed investment exceeds the personal investment limit, our board of directors will only permit the covered person to make the investment (i) upon the approval of the disinterested directors, or (ii) if the proposed investment otherwise complies with terms of any other related party transaction policy our board of directors may adopt in the future. Subject to compliance with all applicable laws, these individuals may make investments for their own account in our target properties which may present certain conflicts of interest not addressed by our current policies.We may acquire properties in geographic areas where ARC or other ARC Funds own competing properties. Also, we may acquire properties from, or sell properties to, ARC or other ARC Funds. If ARC or any one of the other ARC-sponsored programs attracts a tenant that we are competing for, we could suffer a loss of revenue due to delays in locating another suitable tenant.We will pay our Manager substantial management fees, and incentive fees, some of which are payable regardless of the performance of our portfolio. Our Manager's and ARC's entitlement to such fees, which are not based upon performance metrics or goals, might reduce their incentive to devote their time and effort to seeking investments that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our portfolio. This in turn could hurt both our ability to make dividends to our stockholders and the market price of our common stock.27Table of ContentsConcurrently with the completion of our IPO, we granted to our Manager 167,400 restricted shares of Manager's Stock, which is equal to 3.0% of the number of shares sold in our IPO. Such shares of Manager's Stock were converted into shares of our common stock, the vesting of which will accelerate upon the consummation of the Merger. To the extent our Manager sells some of the shares, its interests may be less aligned with our interests.The management agreement with our Manager was not negotiated on an arm's-length basis and may not be as favorable to us as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party and may be costly and difficult to terminate.Our executive officers and certain of our directors are executives of ARC. Our management agreement with our Manager was negotiated between related parties and its terms, including amounts payable thereunder and its term, which exceeds the term of most other externally advised REITs, may not be as favorable to us as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.Termination of the management agreement with our Manager without cause is difficult. During the initial term of the management agreement, the management agreement may be terminated by us only for cause. Following the initial ten-year term (which commenced on September 6, 2011), the management agreement may be terminated annually upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors based upon: (1) our Manager's unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us, or (2) a determination that the management fees payable to our Manager are not fair, subject to our Manager's right to prevent termination based on unfair fees by accepting a reduction of management fees agreed to by at least two-thirds of our independent directors. Our Manager will be provided 180 days prior written notice of any such termination. These provisions may adversely affect our ability to terminate our Manager without cause.Our Manager is only contractually committed to serve us until September 6, 2021, which is the tenth anniversary of the closing of our IPO. Thereafter, the management agreement will be renewable for one-year terms; provided, however, that our Manager may terminate the management agreement annually upon 180 days prior written notice. If the management agreement is terminated and, no suitable replacement is found to manage us, we may not be able to execute our business plan.Pursuant to the management agreement, our Manager will not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder and will not be responsible for any action of our board of directors in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. Our Manager maintains a contractual as opposed to a fiduciary relationship with us. Under the terms of the management agreement, none of our Manager, ARC, or any of their respective officers, members or personnel, any person controlling or controlled by our Manager or ARC or any person providing sub-advisory services to our Manager or ARC will be liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our directors, our stockholders or any subsidiary's stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the management agreement, except because of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of their duties under the management agreement. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify our Manager, ARC and each of their respective officers, stockholders, members, managers, directors and personnel, any person controlling or controlled by our Manager or ARC and any person providing sub-advisory services to our Manager or ARC with respect to all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims arising from acts or omissions of our Manager or ARC not constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of duties, performed in good faith in accordance with and pursuant to the management agreement.The incentive fee payable to our Manager under the management agreement is payable quarterly and is based on our Core Earnings and therefore, may cause our Manager to select investments in more risky assets to increase its incentive compensation.Our Manager is entitled to receive incentive compensation based upon our achievement of targeted levels of Core Earnings. In evaluating investments and other management strategies, the opportunity to earn incentive compensation based on Core Earnings may lead our Manager to place undue emphasis on the maximization of Core Earnings at the expense of other criteria, such as preservation of capital, in order to achieve higher incentive compensation. Investments with higher yield potential are generally riskier or more speculative. This could result in increased risk to the value of our investment portfolio.28Table of ContentsThe conflicts of interest policy we have adopted may not adequately address all of the conflicts of interest that may arise with respect to our investment activities and also may limit the allocation of investments to us.In order to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our Manager, ARC or any affiliates thereof, we have adopted a conflicts of interest policy to specifically address some of the conflicts relating to our investment opportunities. Although under this policy the approval of a majority of our independent directors will be required to approve (i) any purchase of our assets by affiliates of ARC and (ii) any purchase by us of any assets of any affiliates of ARC, there is no assurance that this policy will be adequate to address all of the conflicts that may arise or will address such conflicts in a manner that is favorable to us. In addition, as a result of the investment opportunity allocation provisions applicable to us, other ARC Funds may in the future, participate in some of our investments. Participating investments will not be the result of arm's length negotiations and will involve potential conflicts between our interests and those of the other participating ARC Funds in obtaining favorable terms. Since our executives are also executives of ARC, the same personnel may determine the price and terms for the investments for both us and these ARC Funds and there can be no assurance that any procedural protections, such as obtaining market prices or other reliable indicators of fair market value, will prevent the consideration we pay for these investments from exceeding their fair market value or ensure that we receive terms for a particular investment opportunity that are as favorable as those available from an independent third party.Risks Related to Our Organization and StructureThe supermajority voting requirements applicable to our board of directors in connection with our consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or our engaging in a share exchange will limit our independent directors' ability to influence such corporate matters.Our charter provides that we may not consolidate, merge, sell all or substantially all of our assets or engage in a share exchange, unless such actions are approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our board of directors. As a result, at least one of our directors who is also an executive of ARC will have to approve such significant corporate transactions. This concentrated control limits the ability of our independent directors to influence such corporate matters and could delay, deter or prevent a change of control transaction that might otherwise involve a premium for our shares of common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a result, our directors who are also executive of ARC may block certain transactions that our independent directors otherwise view as being in the best interests of our stockholders. Additionally, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected because of the imbalance of control.Our Sponsor exercised significant influence with respect to the terms of the formation transactions, including transactions in which it determined the compensation our principals ultimately received.We did not conduct arm's length negotiations with our Sponsor with respect to the formation transactions. In the course of structuring the formation transactions, our Sponsor had the ability to influence the type and level of benefits that it, its affiliates (including our principals and our Manager) and our other officers ultimately received from us. In addition, our principals had substantial pre-existing indirect ownership interests in the property subsidiaries that we acquired in the formation transactions and received substantial economic benefits as a result of the formation transactions. In addition, our principals have certain executive management and director positions with us, our Manager and ARC, for which they will receive certain other benefits such as any profits associated with the fees earned by our Manager and ARC and equity based awards.Our charter, the partnership agreement of our operating partnership and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change of control transaction.Our charter, subject to certain exceptions, limits any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of stock and not more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of our shares of stock. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion and upon receipt of certain representations and undertakings, may exempt a person (prospectively or retroactively) from the ownership limits. However, our board of directors may not, among other limitations, grant an exemption from the ownership limits to any person whose ownership, direct or indirect, in excess of the 9.8% ownership limit would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. The ownership limits and the other restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock contained in our charter may delay or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. 29Table of ContentsTax protection provisions on certain properties could limit our operating flexibility.We have agreed with the Contributor, an affiliate of our Sponsor, to indemnify it against adverse tax consequences if we were to sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of the interests in the continuing properties acquired by us in the formation transactions, in a taxable transaction. However, we can sell these properties in a taxable transaction if we pay the Contributor cash in the amount of its tax liabilities arising from the transaction and tax payments. These tax protection provisions apply until September 6, 2021, which is the tenth anniversary of the closing of our IPO. Although it may be in our stockholders' best interest that we sell a property, it may be economically disadvantageous for us to do so because of these obligations. We have also agreed to make debt available for the Contributor to guarantee. We agreed to these provisions in order to assist the Contributor in preserving its tax position after its contribution of its interests in our initial properties. As a result, we may be required to incur and maintain more debt than we would otherwise.We may pursue less vigorous enforcement of certain agreements because of conflicts of interest with certain of our directors and officers.Our principals and certain of our other executive officers and employees had indirect interests in all of the property subsidiaries that we acquired in the formation transactions, which property subsidiaries entered into the contribution agreement and other agreements with us in connection with such acquisitions. We may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under these agreements due to our ongoing relationship with our principals and our other executive officers.Tax consequences to holders of OP units upon a sale or refinancing of our properties may cause the interests of our principals to differ from the interests of our other stockholders.As a result of the unrealized built-in gain that may be attributable to one or more of the contributed properties at the time of contribution in connection with the formation transactions, some holders of OP units, including the Contributor, an affiliate of our Sponsor, may experience different tax consequences than holders of our capital stock upon the sale or refinancing of the properties owned by our operating partnership, including disproportionately greater allocations of items of taxable income and gain upon a realization event. As those holders will not receive a correspondingly greater distribution of cash proceeds, they may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing, timing and other material terms of any sale or refinancing of certain properties, or whether to sell or refinance such properties at all, than those that would be in the best interests of our stockholders taken as a whole.Our Sponsor, the Contributor and our principals will have significant influence over our affairs.Our Sponsor and its affiliates hold a substantial percentage of the shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, the Contributor, an affiliate of our Sponsor, owns 310,000 OP units, which are convertible into 310,000 shares of our common stock; our Manager, which is wholly owned by our Sponsor, owns 167,400 shares of common stock; and, our Sponsor owns 1,630,369 shares of our common stock. As a result, (i) the Contributor owns approximately 2.4% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis; (ii) our Manager owns approximately 1.3% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis; and (iii) our Sponsor owns approximately 12.7% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. In addition, upon the consummation of the Merger, our Sponsor, as the sole owner of the sponsor of ARCT III, will indirectly receive additional OP units, which could be converted to shares of our common stock upon our Sponsor's exercise of their redemption rights with respect to such OP units. Our Sponsor will have influence over our affairs and could exercise such influence in a manner that is not in the best interests of our other stockholders, including by attempting to delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. In addition, our principals serve on our board of directors. These indicia of control are in addition to the control our Sponsor, our executive officers, who also are members of our Sponsor, and our principals will have over our affairs attributable to their direct and indirect ownership interests in our Manager. We are a holding company with no direct operations. As a result, we rely on funds received from our operating partnership to pay liabilities and dividends, our stockholders' claims will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our operating partnership and our stockholders do not have any voting rights with respect to our operating partnership's activities, including the issuance of additional OP units.We are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our operating partnership. We do not have, apart from our ownership of our operating partnership, any independent operations. As a result, we rely on distributions from our operating partnership to pay any dividends we might declare on shares of our common stock. We also rely on distributions from our operating partnership to meet any of our obligations, including tax liability on taxable income allocated to us from our operating partnership (which might make distributions to the company not equal to the tax on such allocated taxable income).30Table of ContentsIn addition, because we are a holding company, stockholders' claims will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for borrowed money) of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, claims of our stockholders will be satisfied only after all of our and our operating partnership's and its subsidiaries' liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.As of December 31, 2012, we owned approximately 92.5% of the OP units in our operating partnership. However, our operating partnership may issue additional OP units in the future. Such issuances could reduce our ownership percentage in our operating partnership. Because our stockholders will not directly own any OP units, they will not have any voting rights with respect to any such issuances or other partnership-level activities of our operating partnership.Our board of directors may create and issue a class or series of common or preferred stock without stockholder approval.Our board of directors is empowered under our charter to amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of our stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue, to designate and issue from time to time one or more classes or series of stock and to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval. Our board of directors may determine the relative preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of any class or series of stock issued. As a result, we may issue series or classes of stock with voting rights, rights to dividends or other rights, senior to the rights of holders of our capital stock. The issuance of any such stock could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.Certain provisions in the partnership agreement of our operating partnership may delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions of us.Provisions in the partnership agreement of our operating partnership may delay or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions of us or changes in our control. These provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition of us or change of our control, although some stockholders might consider such proposals, if made, desirable. These provisions include, among others:•redemption rights of qualifying parties;•transfer restrictions on the OP units;•the ability of the general partner in some cases to amend the partnership agreement without the consent of the limited partners;•the right of the limited partners to consent to transfers of the general partnership interest of the general partner and mergers or consolidations of our company under specified limited circumstances; and•restrictions relating to our qualification as a REIT under the Code.Our charter and bylaws and the partnership agreement of our operating partnership also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. Certain rights which are reserved to our stockholders may allow third parties to enter into business combinations with us that are not in the best interest of the stockholders, without negotiating with our board of directors.Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or the MGCL, may have the effect of requiring a third party seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors, including:•“business combination” provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an “interested stockholder” (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of our company who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding stock) or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes special appraisal rights and stockholder supermajority voting requirements on these combinations; and31Table of Contents•“control share” provisions that provide that “control shares” of our company (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a “control share acquisition” (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding “control shares”) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.As permitted by the MGCL, our board of directors has by resolution exempted business combinations (1) between us and any person, provided that such business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of directors who are not affiliates or associates of such person) and (2) between us and our Sponsor, our Manager, our operating partnership or any of their respective affiliates. Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to such business combinations. As a result, any person described above may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders without compliance by us with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the statute. This resolution, however, may be altered or repealed in whole or in part at any time by our board of directors. If this resolution is repealed, or our board of directors does not otherwise approve a business combination with a person other than our Sponsor, our Manager, our operating partnership or any of their respective affiliates, the statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.Pursuant to a provision in our bylaws, we have opted out of the control share provisions of the MGCL. However, we may, by amendment to our bylaws, opt in to the control shares provisions of the MGCL in the future.Additionally, Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain takeover defenses, such as a classified board, some of which we do not yet have. These provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us under the circumstances that otherwise could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price. Our fiduciary duties as sole general partner of our operating partnership could create conflicts of interest.We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership, and, as such, will have fiduciary duties to our operating partnership and the limited partners in the operating partnership, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. The limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership provides that, in the event of a conflict between the duties owed by our directors to our company and the duties that we owe, in our capacity as the sole general partner of our operating partnership, to such limited partners, our directors are under no obligation to give priority to the interests of such limited partners. In addition, those persons holding OP units will have the right to vote on certain amendments to the limited partnership agreement (which require approval by a majority in interest of the limited partners, including us) and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights, as well as the right to vote on mergers and consolidations of us in our capacity as sole general partner of the operating partnership in certain limited circumstances. These voting rights may be exercised in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. For example, we cannot adversely affect the limited partners' rights to receive distributions, as set forth in the limited partnership agreement, without their consent, even though modifying such rights might be in the best interest of our stockholders generally.We had never operated as a REIT prior to making our initial REIT election on March 15, 2012 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and have only recently begun operating as a public company and, therefore, we cannot assure you that we will successfully and profitably operate our business in compliance with the regulatory requirements applicable to REITs and to public companies.We had never operated as a REIT prior to making our initial REIT election on March 15, 2012 for the year ended December 31, 2011. Also, we have only operated as a public company beginning the date of the closing of our IPO on September 6, 2011. In addition, certain members of our board of directors and certain of our executive officers have no experience in operating a publicly traded REIT that is traded on a securities exchange other than in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully operate our company as a REIT or a publicly traded company, including satisfying the requirements to timely meet disclosure requirements and complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including implementing effective internal controls. Failure to maintain our qualification as a REIT or comply with other regulatory requirements would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders. 32Table of ContentsOur board of directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval.Our investment, financing, borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to other activities, including growth, debt, capitalization and operations, will be determined by our board of directors. These policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of the board of directors without a vote of our stockholders. In addition, the board of directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements. A change in these policies could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders.We are highly dependent on information systems of ARC and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends.Our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems of ARC. Any failure or interruption of ARC's systems could cause delays or other problems in our securities trading activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.Risks Related to the MergerThe Merger of us and ARCT III presents certain risks to our business and operations.We anticipate closing the Merger on February 28, 2013 in a transaction valued at approximately $2.2 billion, based on the ARCP stock price on December 31, 2012. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of ARCT III will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.95 of a share of our common stock or (ii) $12.00 in cash, but in no event will the aggregate consideration paid in cash be paid on more than 30% of the shares of ARCT III's common stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing of the Merger. In addition, each outstanding unit of equity ownership of the ARCT III OP will be converted into the right to receive 0.95 of the same class of unit of equity ownership in our operating partnership. In connection with the Merger, we will add 507 properties to our portfolio and incur indebtedness of approximately $1.0 billion.The Merger presents certain risks to our business and operations, including, among other things, the following: •We may encounter difficulties and incur substantial expenses in integrating ARCT III's properties and systems into our operations and systems which may result in the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in the combined company's operations, services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of the combined company to maintain relationships with tenants, vendors and employees or to fully achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger, and, in any event, the integration may require a substantial amount of time on the part of our Manager and our management and employees and therefore divert their attention from other aspects of our business;•ARCT III's real estate portfolio includes a number of industries which are new to us, including tenants in the Auto Services, Consumer Products, Restaurant, Supermarket, Gas/Convenience, Medical Office, Aerospace and Insurance businesses;•We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger with ARCT III or those benefits may be less than we had anticipated;•The market price of our common stock may decline, particularly if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by securities or industry analysts or if the effect of the Merger on our results of operations and financial condition is not consistent with the expectations of these analysts;•Our level of indebtedness will increase substantially in conjunction with the Merger;•Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded portfolio;•We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue paying dividends on our common stock or preferred stock at the current rates;•If ARCT III failed to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may inherit significant tax liabilities, and we could lose our REIT status should disqualifying activities continue after the Merger;•We may incur unanticipated capital expenditures to maintain or improve the properties and businesses of ARCT III;33Table of Contents•We may encounter difficulties in managing a substantially larger and more complex business with properties in new geographic areas;•Many of ARCT III's tenants operated in industries where we did not have any prior exposure, and the Merger increased our tenant concentration in certain industries;•We may need to implement or improve internal controls, procedures, policies and systems with respect to ARCT III's properties and businesses, which may require substantial time and expenditure;•We may continue to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger, including legal, accounting and financial advisory expenses;•The transaction and integration expenses associated with the Merger could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the businesses following the completion of the Merger;•We may be required to recognize write-offs, impairment charges or amortization charges resulting from the Merger; and•We may encounter unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to the acquired businesses and properties.In addition, a lawsuit was filed in conjunction with the Merger. The action names as defendants ARCT III, the ARCT III operating partnership, the members of the ARCT III board of directors (the “ARCT III Board”), ARCP, our operating partnership and Tiger Acquisition, LLC (“Merger Sub”). The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that the ARCT III Board breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement by agreeing to an inadequate price and employing a flawed process. The complaint further alleges that ARCP and Merger Sub aided and abetted those alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff further alleges that the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on January 22, 2013 was inadequate and failed to provide ARCT III's stockholders with certain material information in connection with the Merger. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, including enjoining or rescinding the Merger, and an award of other unspecified attorneys' and other fees and costs, in addition to other relief. In February 2013, the parties agreed to a memorandum of understanding regarding settlement of all claims asserted on behalf of the alleged class of ARCT III stockholders. In connection with the settlement contemplated by that memorandum of understanding, the class action and all claims asserted therein will be dismissed, subject to court approval. The proposed settlement terms required ARCT III to make certain additional disclosures related to the Merger, which were included in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by ARCT III with the SEC on February 21, 2013. The memorandum of understanding also added that the parties will enter into a stipulation of settlement, which will be subject to customary conditions, including confirmatory discovery and court approval following notice to ARCT III’s stockholders. If the parties enter into a stipulation of settlement, a hearing will be scheduled at which the court will consider the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the settlement. There can be no assurance that the parties will ultimately enter into a stipulation of settlement, that the court will approve any proposed settlement, or that any eventual settlement will be under the same terms as those contemplated by the memorandum of understanding.Our anticipated level of indebtedness will increase upon completion of the Merger and will increase the related risks we now face. In connection with the Merger, we will incur additional indebtedness and will assume certain indebtedness of ARCT III, as a result of which will be subject to increased risks associated with such debt financing, including an increased risk that the combined company's cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on its debt. As of February 15, 2013, we had indebtedness of $160.4 million. Taking into account our existing indebtedness, the incurrence of additional indebtedness in connection with the Merger, and the assumption of indebtedness in the Merger, our pro forma consolidated indebtedness as of February 28, 2013 would be approximately $1.0 billion. Our increased indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of our common stock and preferred stock, including: •increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;34Table of Contents•requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate operating requirements;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and•putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.If we default under a loan, we may automatically be in default under any other loan that has cross-default provisions, and we may lose the properties securing these loans as a result. Your ownership position will be diluted by the Merger of us and ARCT III.The Merger of us and ARCT III will dilute the ownership position of our stockholders. Following the issuance of shares of our common stock to ARCT III stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement, assuming 70% of the Merger consideration is paid in the form of shares of our common stock, our stockholders and the former ARCT III stockholders are expected to hold approximately 9% and 91%, respectively, of the combined company's common stock outstanding immediately after the Merger, based on the number of shares of common stock of each of us and ARCT III currently outstanding and various assumptions regarding share issuances by each of us and ARCT III prior to the effective time of the Merger (provided, however, such dilution could be greater than described herein depending on the number of shares of ARCT III common stock with respect to which ARCT III stockholders make stock elections). Consequently, our stockholders, as a general matter, will have less influence over our management and policies after the Merger than they exercise over our management and policies immediately prior to the Merger.American Realty Capital Advisors III, LLC, or the ARCT III Advisor, will only provide support for a limited period of time under the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, dated as of November 13, 2012, by and among ARCT III, the ARCT III Advisor and the ARCT III operating partnership, or the ARCT III Advisory Agreement.The ARCT III Advisory Agreement, which requires the ARCT III Advisor to provide certain services to ARCT III, including asset management, advisory services, and other essential services, has been terminated and will expire 60 days following the consummation of the Merger. To the extent our employees and infrastructure following the Merger and the Internalization cannot adequately provide any such services to us following the Merger after the expiration of the ARCT III Advisory Agreement, our operations and the market price of our common stock would be adversely affected. U.S. Federal Income Tax RisksOur failure to remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax, and would adversely affect our operations and the market price of our common stock.We have qualified to be taxed as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011 and intend to operate in a manner that would allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, we may terminate our REIT qualification if our board of directors determines that not qualifying as a REIT is in our best interests, or inadvertently. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. We structured our activities in a manner designed to satisfy all requirements for qualification as a REIT. However, the REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT is limited. Furthermore, any opinion of our counsel, including tax counsel, as to our eligibility to remain qualified as a REIT is not binding on the IRS and is not a guarantee that we will continue to qualify as a REIT. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can remain qualified as a REIT. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the IRS, such recharacterization would jeopardize our ability to satisfy all requirements for qualification as a REIT. Furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT. 35Table of ContentsIf we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT qualification. Losing our REIT qualification would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability. In addition, distributions to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction, and we would no longer be required to make distributions. If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax. Even with our REIT qualification, in certain circumstances, we may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for distribution to you.Even with our REIT qualification, we may be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. For example, net income from the sale of properties that are “dealer” properties sold by a REIT (a “prohibited transaction” under the Code) will be subject to a 100% tax. We may not make sufficient dividends to avoid excise taxes applicable to REITs. We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay U.S. federal income tax directly on such income. In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly. However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file U.S. federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax. We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, including franchise, payroll and transfer taxes, either directly or at the level of our operating partnership or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets, such as TRSs, which are subject to full U.S. federal, state, local and foreign corporate-level income taxes. Any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to you.To qualify as a REIT we must meet annual dividend requirements, which may force us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions. This could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce your overall return.In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which dividends we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (a) 85% of our ordinary income, (b) 95% of our capital gain net income and (c) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. These requirements could cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on investments in real estate assets and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, possibly at unfavorable rates, or sell assets to fund these dividends. Although we intend to make dividends sufficient to meet the annual dividend requirements and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings while we qualify as a REIT, it is possible that we might not always be able to do so.Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to the prohibited transaction tax, which could reduce the return on your investment.For so long as we qualify as a REIT, our ability to dispose of property during the first few years following acquisition may be restricted to a substantial extent as a result of our REIT qualification. Under applicable provisions of the Code regarding prohibited transactions by REITs, while we qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of any property (other than foreclosure property) that we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding our TRSs, that is deemed to be inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Whether property is inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each property. While we qualify as a REIT, we intend to avoid the 100% prohibited transaction tax by (a) conducting activities that may otherwise be considered prohibited transactions through a TRS (but such TRS will incur corporate rate income taxes with respect to any income or gain recognized by it), (b) conducting our operations in such a manner so that no sale or other disposition of an asset we own, directly or through any subsidiary, will be treated as a prohibited transaction or (c) structuring certain dispositions of our properties to comply with the requirements of the prohibited transaction safe harbor available under the Code for properties that, among other requirements have been held for at least two years. However, despite our present intention, no assurance can be given that any particular property we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding our TRSs, will not be treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Our two vacant properties will be held in a TRS because we are contemplating various strategies including selling them as a means of maximizing our value from those properties.36Table of ContentsOur TRSs are subject to corporate-level taxes and our dealings with our TRSs may be subject to 100% excise tax.A REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs. Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS. A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs.A TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT, including gross income from operations pursuant to management contracts. We may use TRSs generally to hold properties for sale in the ordinary course of business or to hold assets or conduct activities that we cannot conduct directly as a REIT. Our TRSs will be subject to applicable U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax on its taxable income. In addition, the rules which are applicable to us as a REIT, also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's-length basis.If our operating partnership failed to qualify as a partnership or was not otherwise disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.We intend to maintain the status of our operating partnership as a partnership or a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, if the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of our operating partnership as a partnership or disregarded entity for such purposes, it would be taxable as a corporation. In such event, this would reduce the amount of dividends that our operating partnership could make to us. This also would also result in our failing to qualify as a REIT, and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our income. This substantially would reduce our cash available to pay dividends and the yield on your investment. In addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which our operating partnership owns its properties, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership and is otherwise not disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing dividends to the operating partnership. Such a recharacterization of an underlying property owner could also threaten our ability to maintain our REIT qualification.We may choose to make distributions in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you receive.In connection with our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. In order to satisfy this requirement, we may make distributions that are payable in cash and/or shares of our common stock (which could account for up to 80% of the aggregate amount of such distributions) at the election of each stockholder. Taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. stockholders may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash portion of the distribution received. Accordingly, U.S. stockholders receiving a distribution of our shares may be required to sell shares received in such distribution or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them, at a time that may be disadvantageous, in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the distribution in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such distribution, including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock, by withholding or disposing of part of the shares included in such distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividend income, such sale may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. Various tax aspects of such a taxable cash/stock distribution are uncertain and have not yet been addressed by the IRS. No assurance can be given that the IRS will not impose requirements in the future with respect to taxable cash/stock distributions, including on a retroactive basis, or assert that the requirements for such taxable cash/stock distributions have not been met. 37Table of ContentsThe taxation of distributions to our stockholders can be complex; however, dividends that we make to our stockholders generally will be taxable as ordinary income.Dividends that we make to our taxable stockholders out of current and accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) generally will be taxable as ordinary income. However, a portion of our dividends may (1) be designated by us as capital gain dividends generally taxable as long-term capital gain to the extent that they are attributable to net capital gain recognized by us, (2) be designated by us as qualified dividend income generally to the extent they are attributable to dividends we receive from our TRSs, or (3) constitute a return of capital generally to the extent that they exceed our accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder's investment in our common stock.Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.Currently, the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for this reduced rate. Although this does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common stock. Tax rates could be changed in future legislation.If we were considered to actually or constructively pay a “preferential dividend” to certain of our stockholders, our status as a REIT could be adversely affected.In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. In order for distributions to be counted as satisfying the annual distribution requirements for REITs, and to provide us with a REIT-level tax deduction, the distributions must not be “preferential dividends.” A dividend is not a preferential dividend if the distribution is pro rata among all outstanding shares of stock within a particular class, and in accordance with the preferences among different classes of stock as set forth in our organizational documents. Currently, there is uncertainty as to the IRS’s position regarding whether certain arrangements that REITs have with their stockholders could give rise to the inadvertent payment of a preferential dividend (e.g., the pricing methodology for stock purchased under a distribution reinvestment plan inadvertently causing a greater than 5% discount on the price of such stock purchased). While we believe that our operations have been structured in such a manner that we will not be treated as inadvertently paying preferential dividends, there is no de minimis exception with respect to preferential dividends. Therefore, if the IRS were to take the position that we inadvertently paid a preferential dividend, we may be deemed either to (a) have distributed less than 100% of our REIT taxable income and be subject to tax on the undistributed portion, or (b) have distributed less than 90% of our REIT taxable income and our status as a REIT could be terminated for the year in which such determination is made if we were unable to cure such failure. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets, if properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations, does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in a TRS generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such TRS.38Table of ContentsComplying with REIT requirements may force us to forgo or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of mortgage-related securities. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets from our portfolio or not make otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for dividend to our stockholders.The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may subject us to U.S. federal income tax and reduce dividends to our stockholders.Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. While we elected to be qualified to be taxed as a REIT, we may terminate our REIT election if we determine that qualifying as a REIT is no longer in the best interests of our stockholders. If we cease to be a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our stockholders and on the market price of our common stock.We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability, reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the market price of our common stock.In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock. Additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets. You are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on your investment in our shares and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares. You also should note that our counsel's tax opinion is based upon existing law, applicable as of the date of its opinion, all of which will be subject to change, either prospectively or retroactively.Although REITs generally receive better tax treatment than entities taxed as regular corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation. As a result, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the vote of our stockholders. Our board of directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders.The share ownership restrictions of the Code for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our shares of stock and restrict our business combination opportunities.In order to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code, may not own, actually or constructively, more than 50% in value of our issued and outstanding shares of stock at any time during the last half of each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made. Attribution rules in the Code determine if any individual or entity actually or constructively owns our shares of stock under this requirement. Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own our shares of stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year for each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made. To help insure that we meet these tests, among other purposes, our charter restricts the acquisition and ownership of our shares of stock. 39Table of ContentsOur charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT while we so qualify. Unless exempted by our board of directors, for so long as we qualify as a REIT, our charter prohibits, among other limitations on ownership and transfer of shares of our stock, any person from beneficially or constructively owning (applying certain attribution rules under the Code) more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of stock and more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of our shares of stock. Our board of directors may not grant an exemption from these restrictions to any proposed transferee whose ownership in excess of the 9.8% ownership limit would result in the termination of our qualification as a REIT. These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply, however, if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with the restrictions is no longer required in order for us to continue to so qualify as a REIT. These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders. Non-U.S. stockholders will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on dividends received from us and upon the disposition of our shares.Subject to certain exceptions, dividends received from us will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Such dividends ordinarily will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the dividends are treated as “effectively connected” with the conduct by the non-U.S. stockholder of a U.S. trade or business. Pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, or FIRPTA, capital gain dividends attributable to sales or exchanges of “U.S. real property interests,” or USRPIs, generally will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. However, a capital gain dividend will not be treated as effectively connected income if (a) the dividend is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States; and (b) the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 5% of the class of our stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date the dividend is received. We anticipate that our shares will be “regularly traded” on an established securities market for the foreseeable future, although, no assurance can be given that this will be the case. Gain recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale or exchange of our common stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a USRPI under FIRPTA. Our common stock will not constitute a USRPI so long as we are a “domestically-controlled qualified investment entity.” A domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT if at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of such REIT's stock is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. stockholders. We believe, but cannot assure you, that we will be a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity, and because our common stock will be publicly traded, no assurance can be given that we will be a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity.Even if we do not qualify as a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity at the time a non-U.S. stockholder sells or exchanges our common stock, gain arising from such a sale or exchange would not be subject to U.S. taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI if: (a) our common stock is “regularly traded,” as defined by applicable Treasury regulations, on an established securities market, and (b) such non-U.S. stockholder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of our common stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale. We encourage you to consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences applicable to you if you are a non-U.S. stockholder. Potential characterization of dividends or gain on sale may be treated as unrelated business taxable income to tax-exempt investors.If (a) we are a “pension-held REIT,” (b) a tax-exempt stockholder has incurred (or is deemed to have incurred) debt to purchase or hold our common stock, or (c) a holder of common stock is a certain type of tax-exempt stockholder, dividends on, and gains recognized on the sale of, common stock by such tax-exempt stockholder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax as unrelated business taxable income under the Code.Item 1B.
