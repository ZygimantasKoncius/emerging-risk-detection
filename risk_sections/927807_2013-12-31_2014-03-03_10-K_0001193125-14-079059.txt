Business Description of Business IBC is a bank holding company incorporated in 1993 under the laws of the State of Delaware and its common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol IBCA. IBC is the parent company of INB and owns 100% of its capital stock. IBCs primary purpose is the ownership of INB. It does not engage in any other business activities other than, from time to time, a limited amount of real estate mortgage lending, including the participation in loans originated by INB. IBC from time to time also issues debt and equity securities as needed to raise funds for working capital purposes. IBC also owns 100% of the capital stock of four statutory business trusts (Intervest Statutory Trust II, III, IV and V, or the Trusts), all of which are unconsolidated entities for financial statement purposes. The Trusts do not conduct business and were formed prior to 2006 for the sole purpose of issuing and administering trust preferred securities and lending the proceeds to IBC as discussed in note 9 to the financial statements in this report. INB is a nationally chartered commercial bank that opened for business on April 1, 1999 and accounts for 99% of our assets. In addition to its headquarters and full-service banking office in Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, INB has a total of six full-service banking offices in Pinellas County, Florida - four in Clearwater, one in Clearwater Beach and one in South Pasadena. 3 Table of Contents INB also has a beneficial ownership interest in certain limited liability companies whose sole purpose is to hold title to real estate INB may thereby beneficially acquire through foreclosure or otherwise. The offices of IBC and INBs headquarters and full-service banking office are leased and located on the entire fourth floor of One Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, New York, 10020-2002. The main telephone number is 212-218-2800. Our business is banking and real estate lending conducted through INBs operations. INB conducts a personalized banking business that attracts deposits from the general public. INB solicits deposit accounts from individuals, small businesses and professional firms located throughout its primary market areas in New York and Florida by offering various deposit products. INB uses these deposits, together with funds generated from its operations, principal repayments of loans and securities and from other sources, to originate mortgage loans secured by real estate and to purchase investment securities. INB also provides internet banking services through its website, which also attracts deposit customers from both within and outside INBs primary market areas. INBs deposit flows and the rates it pays on deposits are influenced by interest rates on competing investments. INBs volume of loan originations is dependent on a number of factors, including loan demand and whether the interest rate and maturity terms and credit risks associated with potential new loans are suitable for its portfolio and meet its Board-approved underwriting standards. INB faces strong competition in the attraction of deposits and the origination of loans. INBs deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) to the extent permitted by law. INBs core data processing is outsourced and is performed by Fiserv, Inc, a leading global provider of information management and electronic commerce systems for the financial services industry. Our revenues consist of interest, dividends and fees earned on our interest-earning assets and noninterest income. Our expenses consist of interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities and noninterest expenses. Our net interest and dividend income is the difference between interest and dividend income generated from our interest-earning assets and interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities, and is dependent upon an interest-rate spread (which is the difference between the yield earned on interest-earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Our noninterest income is derived mostly from loan and other banking fees as well as income from loan prepayments. When a mortgage loan is repaid prior to maturity, we may recognize prepayment income, which consists of the recognition of unearned fees associated with such loans at the time of payoff and the receipt of additional prepayment fees and/or interest in certain cases in accordance with the prepayment provisions in the mortgage loan. The amount and timing of, as well as income from loan prepayments, if any, cannot be predicted with certainty and can fluctuate significantly. Normally, the number of mortgage loans that are prepaid tends to increase during periods of declining interest rates and tends to decrease during periods of increasing interest rates. However, given the nature and type of the mortgage loans we originate, we may still experience loan prepayments notwithstanding the effects of movements in interest rates. Loan prepayment income can be significant to our net operating results. Our noninterest expenses are derived primarily from the following: salaries and employee benefits; stock compensation; occupancy and equipment; data processing; professional fees and services; FDIC insurance; general insurance; real estate activities; and other operating expenses. We also record provisions (credits) for loan and real estate losses and income tax expense or benefit. The real estate activities category comprises expenses (net of rental and other income generated from collateral properties) such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and other charges, required in protecting our interest in real estate acquired through foreclosure and various properties collateralizing our nonaccrual loans. Our profitability is affected by all the factors discussed above and is also significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions and changes in real estate values in the New York City metropolitan area and the State of Florida, our primary market areas, and by related monetary and fiscal policies of banking regulatory agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC), the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the FRB) and the FDIC. INB is subject to the supervision, regulation and examination of the OCC. IBC is subject to examination and regulation by the FRB and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). 4 Table of Contents Business Strategy Our business strategy is to attract deposits through competitive pricing and use those deposits along with other funds generated from our operations to originate commercial and multifamily real estate loans on a profitable basis, while maintaining the combination of efficient customer service and prompt loan underwriting, a low-cost infrastructure and a strong capital position in excess of well-capitalized standards to support our current operations and potential future growth. We rely upon the relationships we have developed with our borrowers and brokers with whom we have done business in the past as primary sources of new loans. We believe that our extensive knowledge and experience with commercial and multifamily real estate lending coupled with our ability to rapidly and efficiently analyze, process and close mortgage loans gives us a competitive advantage. Our goal is to deliver personalized service and respond with flexibility to customer needs. We consider the ability of our management to be both accessible and responsive to both brokers and borrowers as core strengths of our organization, and one of the reasons we can make timely decisions on lending opportunities. Our senior lending officers have extensive lending expertise with excellent reputations and are known in the market for their flexibility, ability to structure deals and for honoring commitments. We provide a high level of service due to our knowledge of our customer-base and the market areas we serve. We believe all the aforementioned factors distinguish us from larger banks that operate in our primary market areas. Market Area for Deposits Our primary market area for our New York office is the New York metropolitan area, consisting of the five boroughs of New York City and the areas surrounding them. New York City is the nations financial capital and the home of more than 8 million individuals representing virtually every race and nationality. It also has a vibrant and diverse business community with many businesses and professional service firms. Historically, the New York City metropolitan area has benefited from being the corporate headquarters of many large industrial and commercial national companies, which have, in turn, attracted many smaller companies, particularly within the service industry. At June 30, 2013, INB ranked 37th out of 102 financial institutions in Manhattan with a deposit market share of 0.07%. Total market deposits in Manhattan at that date exceeded $742 billion. INBs branch in Rockefeller Center had a deposit size of $505 million at June 30, 2013 compared to a $1.1 billion average branch size of all financial institutions operating in Manhattan. Our primary market area for our Florida offices is Pinellas County in the Tampa Bay Area, which is located on the West Coast of Florida, midway up the Florida peninsula. The major cities in the area are Tampa (Hillsborough County) and St. Petersburg and Clearwater (Pinellas County). Pinellas County is the sixth most populous county (917,000 people) and the most densely populated county (3,347 people per square mile) in Florida per 2010 census information. This area also has many seasonal residents. At June 30, 2013, INB ranked 7th out of 36 financial institutions in Pinellas County with a deposit market share of 2.63%. Total market deposits in Pinellas County at that date exceeded $30 billion. INBs Florida branches had an average deposit size of $132 million per branch at June 30, 2013. The average branch size of all financial institutions operating in Pinellas County was $97 million at June 30, 2013. INBs deposit-gathering market also includes its internet web site: www.intervestnatbank.com, which attracts deposit customers from both within and outside its primary market areas. Competition In one or more aspects of our business, we compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries. Most of these competitors are larger than us and may enjoy efficiencies and competitive advantages over us in pricing, delivery and marketing of their products and services. We believe that, despite the continued growth of large institutions and the potential for large out-of-area banking and financial institutions to enter our market areas, there will continue to be opportunities for efficiently-operated, service-oriented, well-capitalized, community-based banking organizations like us. Competition for depositors funds and for credit-worthy loan customers is intense and is based upon interest rates and other credit and service charges, the quality of service provided, the convenience of banking facilities, the products offered and, in the case of larger commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. 5 Table of Contents Lending Activities General. Our lending activities are comprised almost entirely of the origination for our loan portfolio of first mortgage loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate. Our lending model focuses on acquisition loans for income producing properties that have sufficient cash flow to support the loans debt service and have rents that are below market with the likelihood of increasing over time. We also lend on properties that are vacant or substantially vacant and may require improvements to generate stabilized cash flows, as well as those located in geographical areas that are in the process of being revitalized or redeveloped, with a concentration of loans on properties located in New York and Florida, as well as some properties located mostly on the East Coast of the U.S. Most recently we have also expanded our lending market to include some Midwest states, primarily in the case of single tenant retail properties. As a matter of policy, we do not own or originate construction/development loans or condominium conversion loans. We also offer commercial and consumer loans, but do not emphasize such lending. Sources of Loans. Mortgage brokers are the source of substantially all of the loans we originate. The brokers are paid a fee by the borrower upon the funding of the loan. Our reputation within the real estate community, with both borrowers and brokers, is critical to our ability to originate loans. To a lesser extent, our loan originations are also derived from advertising in newspapers and trade journals, existing customers, referrals from attorneys, direct solicitation by our officers and walk-in customers. Market Areas for Loans. We tend to lend in areas that are in the process of being revitalized or redeveloped, with a concentration of loans on properties located in New York and Florida. A large number of the properties in New York are located in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, Staten Island and the Bronx. A large number of the properties we lend on in Florida are located in Clearwater, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood and Miami. More recently, we have also increased our originations outside of these two states. At December 31, 2013, we also had loans on properties in Alabama, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin. Lending Policies and Criteria. Our lending activities are conducted pursuant to INBs Board-approved written policies and defined lending limits, including the types and amounts of loans we can originate. As a national bank, INB may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of INBs unimpaired capital and surplus. Additional amounts may be loaned, not in excess of 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if such loans or extensions of credit are secured by readily-marketable collateral. INBs internal policy requires full approval of its Board if any loan application amount exceeds 5% of its regulatory capital or exceeds 7.5% of its regulatory capital for loan-to-one-borrower limitation purposes. In originating real estate loans, we primarily consider the net operating income generated by the underlying property to support the loans debt service, including whether the rents are below market with the potential to increase, the marketability and value of the property, the financial resources, liquidity, income level and managerial expertise of the borrower and its principal(s), and any prior lending experience we may have had with the borrower and/or its principal(s). All new loans are referred to one of our two senior lending officers, our Chairman and INBs President, both of whom have substantial experience in commercial and multifamily real estate lending and have been with us since the inception of INB. These two officers, with oversight from INBs Board of Directors and its Loan Committee, determine which lending opportunities are suitable for us, including setting all interest rates, fees charged and maturity terms of the loans we originate. All new loans in excess of $250,000 must be first reviewed and approved by INBs Loan Committee, which is comprised of three members of INBs Board of Directors, one of whom is also our Chairman and the other two are independent directors. Both INBs Chief Credit Officer and INBs President attend and participate in all meetings of the Loan Committee. As part of our lending policies, loan-to-value ratios (the ratio that the original principal amount of the loan bears to the lower of the purchase price or appraised value of the property securing the loan at the time of origination) on loans originated by us by policy may not exceed 80%, and in practice, rarely exceed 75%. Additionally, debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of the net operating income generated by the property securing the loan to the required debt service) typically are not less than 1.2 times. 6 Table of Contents We also make loans on properties where there is limited or no cash flow being generated (including loans collateralized by land). For these loans, we rely on capable hands-on owners who over time, can improve or develop the property and increase the cash flow therefrom and are able to meet the loans debt service requirements through their other verified sources of income, while such improvements are being made. Our underwriting procedures require the following: an appraisal of the property securing the loan that is performed by a licensed or certified appraiser approved by us to determine the propertys adequacy as collateral; a physical inspection of the property by us; mortgage title insurance; flood insurance when required; fire insurance; casualty, liability and boiler and machinery insurance; and environmental surveys. In addition, we have an internal and external appraisal review process to monitor and evaluate third-party appraisals. We also perform other analyses which may include: the condition and use of the subject property; the propertys income-producing capacity and its current level of rents; risks inherent in the propertys tenants, the global cash flows of the borrower or the principal(s) of the borrower; and the quality and experience of the propertys owner. Credit reports and other verifications, including searches related to the requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the USA Patriot Act, are obtained to substantiate specific information relating to the applicants income, credit standing and legal status. We may also require personal guarantees from the principals of our borrowers as additional security, although loans are often originated on a limited recourse basis. Loan Terms and Fees. We originate generally short-term loans of no more than 5 to 10 years that have balloon payments at maturity. Depending on market conditions and borrower preferences, the loans have either fixed or variable interest rates, including some loans with interest rates that increase over the life of the loan on a predetermined schedule. Our loans typically provide for periodic payments of interest and principal during the term of the loan, with the remaining principal balance and any accrued interest due at maturity. Our loans generally have amortization schedules common to the banking industry of generally 25 to 30 years. We also originate some longer-term, self-liquidating loans whereby the principal is fully paid down by maturity. The terms and conditions of each loan are generally tailored to the needs of the borrower and consider the financial strength of the project and any guarantors, among other factors. We also normally charge loan origination fees based on a percentage of the principal amount of the loan. These fees are normally comprised of a fee that is collected at the time the loan is originated and another similar fee that is contractually due when the loan is repaid (which we may refer to as an exit fee in this report). We record the exit fee as a receivable when the loan is originated. The total of origination and exit fees, net of our direct loan origination costs, are deferred and amortized over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment to the loans yield in accordance with GAAP. We also earn other fee income and charges from the servicing of the loans we originate. Recent Lending Trends. Over the past several years, due to increased liquidity in the banking system and widespread increasing competition for real estate loans, particularly multifamily loans in the New York City metropolitan area, the effective loan rates for multifamily (as well as commercial real estate loans to a large extent) have been driven down substantially from historical levels, with interest rates recently offered as low as 3% or below for 5 to 10 year multifamily balloon products, with a portion being interest only loans. Aggressive pricing by our competitors has fueled interest rate and term competition. Further, the lower interest rates have driven up the principal size of these loans in relation to the perceived value of the underlying collateral. We have also seen a shift in recent years of rental properties being converted to condominium or cooperative status which takes them out of the normal multifamily market. All of these conditions have reduced what we believe to be suitable lending opportunities for us during the past few years, particularly in the New York multifamily real estate market. The market conditions described above have resulted in a large number of the loans we originated prior to 2010 being repaid through refinancing by other institutions. Our new loan originations, moreover, have been more weighted towards commercial real estate loans, with an emphasis on mixed-use properties, retail strip centers and commercial buildings with single-tenant occupancy. We have increased our lending over the last three years in the single tenant non-credit and credit sectors of the commercial real estate market due to attractive collateral values and yields in this market. At December 31, 2013, single tenant non-credit loans accounted for approximately 12% of our total loan portfolio, compared to approximately 2% at the end of 2010. 7 Table of Contents We have also increased our lending over the last three years on loans to investors that are secured by blocks of residential condominium dwelling units due to attractive collateral values and yields in this market, particularly in our Florida market. These dwelling units are characterized as 1-4 family dwelling units. At December 31, 2013, such loans accounted for approximately 6% of our total loan portfolio compared to less than 1% at the end of 2010. We have also increased our lending over the last three years on loans where the collateral properties (mostly single tenant) are located outside of our primary markets of New York and Florida. At December 31, 2013, such loans accounted for approximately 13% of our total loan portfolio compared to less than 9% at the end of 2010. The market conditions and trends described above have caused our total commercial real estate loans as a percentage of our total loans to increase from 71% at the end of 2010 to 74% at December 31, 2013, while our multifamily loans, inclusive of loans on investor owned 1-4 family condominiums, as a percentage of total loans have decreased from 28% to 25% during the same time frame. The average yield on our entire loan portfolio has also declined from a weighted-average of 6.36% for the entire year of 2010 to 5.21% for the most recent quarter ended December 31, 2013, reflecting lower market interest rates and highly competitive conditions in originating new loans. Additionally, during the same time frame, as a result of competitive market conditions, lower pricing in originating loans and borrower preference for fixed-rate products, we have originated nearly all fixed-rate loans with somewhat longer maturities. Loans with fixed interest rates constituted approximately 99% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2013, compared to 78% at the end of 2010. The loan portfolio had a short weighted-average remaining contractual life of approximately 4.6 years as of December 31, 2013, compared to 3.5 years at December 31, 2010. See the section Asset and Liability Management in Item 7 of this report for further discussion of the impact of fixed-rate loans on our interest rate risk. We cannot predict how long the above trends or factors will continue or how they will impact our loan origination volumes, loan types and loan terms over the long term. Lending Risks. Commercial and multifamily real estate loans are generally considered to have more credit risk than traditional single family residential loans because these loans tend to involve larger loan balances and their repayment is typically dependent upon the successful operation and management of the underlying real estate. Included in this category are loans we originate on vacant or substantially vacant properties, all of which typically have limited or no income streams and depend upon other sources of cash flow from the borrower for repayment, which add an additional element of risk. Our vacant land loans normally have no income streams and also depend upon other sources of cash flow from the borrower for repayment. We define substantially vacant properties as follows: commercial real estate - occupancy of less than 70% of rentable square feet; and for multifamily - occupancy of less than 70% of rentable apartments. We also have single tenant non-credit and credit loans as defined at the end of this paragraph. This includes loans on real estate leased to national and regional chains of specialty restaurants, fast food establishments, retailers, drug stores and convenience stores, bank branches and some single occupancy office buildings, with a large portion of the new loans originated in states other than New York and Florida, including geographical areas that are considered secondary and tertiary markets. A significant portion of the loans secured by restaurants (which totaled approximately $67 million at December 31, 2013) are guaranteed by the borrowers and not by the franchisees that operate the business or by the franchisor. Nearly all of the single tenants have triple net leases, whereby the tenant also pays all of the utilities, property taxes and insurance directly to the appropriate vendors and municipalities. Loans with single-tenant exposure may have greater risk of default than loans on buildings with large, diversified tenant rosters. Moreover, some of the single tenant loans in our portfolio have leases that expire before the loan matures which further increases the credit risk of these loans, although in many cases, these loans have accelerated principal amortization schedules and the leases contain renewal options. In such situations, there is always the risk that the tenant will not renew upon lease maturity, which may result in a significant amount of time and expense involved with replacing a major tenant if it were to vacate or default on its payments or if we were to acquire the property through foreclosure. Furthermore, tenants that are not rated or are rated non-credit (non-credit defined as tenants with a debt rating from the major rating agencies, such as Standard and Poors, that is below investment grade or BBB for example) also pose a greater risk of default as compared to credit rated tenants. 8 Table of Contents We also have certain loans categorized as 1-4 family loans, which consist almost entirely of loans secured by blocks of investor-owned individual condominium dwelling units. We normally make these loans to investors who purchase multiple condo units that remain unsold after a condo conversion or the unsold units in a new condo development. The units are normally rented for a number of years until the economy improves and the units can be sold as originally intended. Nearly all of these loans are in our Florida market. Although we classify loans secured by blocks of investor-owned individual condominium dwelling units as 1-4 family as required by regulatory guidance, they are underwritten by us in accordance with our more stringent multifamily underwriting polices. Because we believe that the risk characteristics of these loans are essentially the same as our multifamily real estate lending, we also risk weight them for regulatory capital purposes at 100%. Many of our loans have balloon payments at maturity, which require a substantial part of or the entire original principal amount to be paid in one lump sum payment at maturity. If the net revenue from the property, or other sources of cash flow from the borrower, is not sufficient to make all debt service payments due on the loan or, if at maturity or the due date of any balloon payment, the owner of the property fails to raise the funds (through refinancing the loan, sale of the property or otherwise) to make the lump sum payment, we could sustain a loss on the loan. All of our loans require ongoing evaluation and monitoring since they may be negatively affected to a large degree by adverse conditions in the real estate markets or the economy or changes in government regulation. Moreover, a number of our borrowers also have more than one mortgage loan outstanding with us and some may also own other properties that are encumbered by separate mortgages from other lenders, which may impair their ability to repay their obligations with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to such borrowers may expose us to a greater risk of loss to our otherwise performing loans with the same borrower. Furthermore, banking regulators continue to give commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny and banks with higher levels of these loans are expected to implement improved underwriting and risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as maintain higher levels of allowances for possible losses and high capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures. Our mortgage loans are also not insured or guaranteed by governmental agencies. In the event of a default, our ability to ultimately recover our investment in the loan is dependent upon the market value of the mortgaged property and the enforceability and collectability of the borrowers personal guarantees, where applicable. Loan Portfolio Data. At December 31, 2013, our real estate loans consisted of 557 loans with an aggregate principal balance of $1.13 billion and an average loan size of $2.0 million. Loans with principal balances of more than $10 million consisted of 10 loans with an aggregate principal balance of $124 million, with the largest loan being $16.3 million. Loans with principal balances of $5 million to $10 million consisted of 44 loans and aggregated to $282 million. The tables that follow set forth certain information regarding the loan portfolio.

An anchored center contains one tenant, which may be either a credit or non-credit tenant, whose percentage of the propertys total income and rentable space is 50% or greater. (2) Comprised of properties having both residential and commercial use, usually containing retail or commercial space on the ground floor. Mixed use loans are classified as multifamily or commercial based on the greater percentage of income from residential or commercial use. (3) Comprised of properties occupied by a single tenant consisting mostly of restaurants, bank branches, fast food establishments, discount retailers, retail drugstore chains, convenience stores, grocery stores, as well as local retailers and service and repair businesses. The single tenants have been further segmented by those with an investment grade rating (minimum BBB rating on its publicly traded debt), or credit tenants, and those that are either non-rated or have a less than investment grade rating, or non-credit tenants. (4) Comprised of office building properties, normally with multiple floors with multiple tenants engaged in various businesses, including medical, administrative and legal services. (5) Comprised typically of commercial buildings used for or intended to be used for the storage of goods by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport businesses, etc. They are usually large buildings in industrial areas of cities/towns/villages that contain one or more tenants. (6) Hotel properties in Florida are comprised of flagged hotels located in Orlando, Miami Beach, Clearwater and Tampa areas, with room counts ranging from 50 to over 200 and floors ranging from 2 to 7. Hotel properties in New York are comprised predominantly of single occupancy room hotels (commonly known as SROs) in New York City and Brooklyn, and several small non-flagged hotels/motels in Long Island. (7) Mobile homes are often sited in land lease communities known as mobile home parks. These communities allow home owners to rent space on which to place a home, normally consisting of single or double manufactured homes. In addition to providing space, the community can provide basic utilities and other amenities. (8) Mini-storage facilities, also known as self-storage, are storage space facilities leased to individuals or companies for storing various personal items or business parts or inventory. Mini-storage facilities may also provide other services in addition to rentals. (9) Comprised of apartment buildings principally in the 5 boroughs of New York City consisting mostly of pre- and post-war walkup, elevator and loft buildings, including brownstones and townhouses, further segmented by those subject to rent regulations (rent control and rent stabilization). (10) Comprised of garden style apartments, which refer to a large development of small apartment buildings two to four stories tall where there are no internal hallways, although adjacent apartments may share a wall. Entrance to the apartments is from a common stairwell or patio, and the buildings are typically surrounded by outdoor landscaping or patios. (11) Comprised nearly all of investor-owned individual residential condominium dwelling units or townhouses. These loans are made primarily to investors who purchase multiple (blocks of) units/townhouses that remain unsold after a condo conversion or the unsold units in a new development. The units are normally rented (or in the process of being rented) for an extended period of time until they can be sold as originally intended. The loans are underwritten in accordance with our multifamily underwriting policies and their risk characteristics are essentially the same as our multifamily real estate lending, and we risk weight them for regulatory capital purposes the same as substantially all of the rest of our loan portfolio, or at 100%. 11 Table of Contents Notes to preceding table continued: (12) Consist of loans where the underlying collateral is not producing adequate cash flows to service the loans required payments (predominantly in cases where the collateral is a vacant or substantially vacant building or land) and such payments are being made by the borrowers other sources of funds. In many such cases, the borrower or its principals has guaranteed the loan and/or deposited escrow funds with us to cover the loans contractual debt service payments for a portion of or the entire loan term while the underlying collateral property is being leased up or improved to increase rents. These types of loans include loans known in the industry as bridge loans. In accordance with our internal grading criteria (which considers loan-to-value ratios, personal guarantees, projected stabilized cash flows from the collateral, deposits of debt service payments with us and other qualitative factors), the total amount of these loans were internally graded as follows: $192 million were pass rated, $6 million were special mention rated and $45 million were substandard rated. The table below sets forth information regarding the credit quality of the loan portfolio based on internally assigned ratings (as defined in note 1 to the financial statements in this report).

Asset Quality In addition to our underwriting standards discussed previously, after a loan is originated, we undertake various steps (such as an annual physical inspection of the subject property and periodic monitoring of loan documentation, rent rolls, cash flows and the value of the property securing the loan) with the objective of quickly identifying, evaluating and initiating corrective actions if necessary. We constantly monitor the payment status of our loans and pursue a timely follow-up on any delinquencies, including initiating collection procedures even before a loan is 90 days past due, as deemed necessary. We also assess substantial late fees on delinquent loan payments and other service charges. All of the loans we originate are subject to the risk of default, otherwise known as credit risk, which represents the possibility of us not recovering amounts due from our borrowers. The credit quality of our loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrowers ability to continue to make required loan payments and, in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so, the value of the real estate securing the loan. A borrowers ability to pay in the case of multifamily and commercial real estate loans is typically dependent on the cash flow generated by the underlying collateral property, which can be impacted by economic conditions. Other factors, such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in financial and real estate markets, may also impact a borrowers ability to pay. Real estate values are also impacted by a variety of other factors including collection or foreclosure delays. Additionally, political issues, including armed conflicts, acts of terrorism, or natural disasters, such as hurricanes, may have an adverse impact on economic conditions of the country as a whole and may be more pronounced in specific geographic regions. All of these factors can affect the rents and occupancy levels of the collateral properties, which in turn affect their market value and the amounts we may ultimately recover in the event of a default. Loan concentrations are defined as amounts loaned to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities or on properties located in a particular geographic area. Our loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage loans. The properties securing these loans are also concentrated primarily in two states, New York and Florida. Many of the properties securing our loans are also located in geographical areas that are being revitalized or redeveloped, which can be impacted more severely by a downturn in real estate values. Moreover, many of the real estate loans we originate are on properties requiring rehabilitation or have deferred maintenance. We place loans on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes 90 days or more past due or earlier in certain cases, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. All previously accrued and uncollected interest and late charges on loans placed on nonaccrual status are reversed through a charge to interest income and the amortization of any unearned fee income is discontinued. 13 Table of Contents While loans are on nonaccrual status, interest income is normally recognized only to the extent cash is received until a return to accrual status is warranted. In some circumstances, interest continues to accrue on mortgage loans that have matured and the borrower continues to make monthly payments of principal and interest. These loans are classified as 90 days past due and still accruing interest if they are well secured and in the process of collection. We estimate the fair value of the properties that collateralize our impaired loans based on a variety of information, including third party appraisals and our managements judgment of other factors. Our internal policy is to obtain externally prepared appraisals (or in limited cases indications of value from licensed appraisers or local real estate brokers) as follows: for all impaired loans; for restructured or renewed loans; upon classification or downgrade of a loan; upon accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure; upon transfer of a loan to foreclosed real estate; and at least annually thereafter for all of our impaired and substandard rated loans and real estate owned through foreclosure. In addition to obtaining appraisals, we also consider the knowledge and experience of our two senior lending officers (our Chairman and INBs President) and INBs Chief Credit Officer related to values of properties in our geographical market areas. These officers take into account various information, including: local and national real estate market data provided by third parties; the consideration of the type, condition, location and occupancy of the specific collateral property as well as the current economic conditions and demand for the specific property in the area the property is located in assessing our internal estimates of fair value. Additionally, we require that all third-party appraisals we receive be reviewed by a different external appraiser for reasonableness. From time to time, we may restructure a loan. A loan that we restructure, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties, and for which we have granted certain concessions to the borrower that we would not otherwise have considered is considered a troubled debt restructure or TDR. These concessions are made to provide payment relief generally consisting of the deferral of principal and or interest payments for a period of time, a partial reduction in interest payments or an extension of the maturity date. In determining if a concession has been made, we also consider if the borrower is able to access funds in the general market place at a market rate for debt with similar risk characteristics as the restructured debt. A loan that is extended or renewed at a stated interest rate equal to the current interest rate for a new loan originated by us with similar risk is not reported as a TDR. We normally place a TDR on nonaccrual status upon restructure and subsequently return the TDR to an accrual status if the ultimate collectability of all contractual principal is assured, and the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory payment performance either before or after the restructuring, usually consisting of a minimum six-month period. We may acquire and beneficially hold title to real property pursuant to a foreclosure of a mortgage loan in the normal course of business beneficially through a subsidiary or an affiliated entity. These properties are held for sale. Upon foreclosure of the property, the related loan is transferred from the loan portfolio to the foreclosed real estate category at the estimated fair value of the property, less estimated selling costs. Such amount becomes the new cost basis of the property. Adjustments made to reduce the carrying value at the time of transfer are charged to the allowance for loan losses as a loan chargeoff. After foreclosure, we periodically perform market valuations (which include obtaining an appraisal of the collateral property at least annually) and, based on these valuations, the property is carried at the lower of its cost basis or estimated fair value less estimated selling costs. Changes in the valuation allowance of the property are charged to the Provision for Real Estate Losses. Revenues and expenses from operations of the property are included in the caption Real Estate Activities Expenses. 14 Table of Contents The table below summarizes nonperforming assets, TDRs, past due loans and selected ratios at the dates indicated.

Interest income from payments made on all nonaccrual loans is recognized on a cash basis (or when collected) if the outstanding principal is determined to be collectible. A loan on nonaccrual status can only be returned to accrual status if ultimate collectability of contractual principal is assured and the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory payment performance. In the case of a TDR, satisfactory payment performance can be achieved either before or after the restructuring (usually for a period of no shorter than six months). (2) Represent loans whose terms have been modified through the deferral of principal and/or a partial reduction in interest payments, or extension of maturity term (referred to as a TDR in this report). All were current as to payments and performing in accordance with their restructured terms at the dates indicated, but were required to be classified nonaccrual for the reasons noted in footnote 1 above. (3) These loans were yielding 4.56% on a weighted-average basis at December 31, 2013. A number of the nonaccrual TDR loans in the table above (which aggregated to 3 loans or $10 million at December 31, 2013) have been partially charged-off (by a cumulative total of $5.4 million). For these TDRs, the evaluation for full repayment of contractual principal must include the collectability of amounts charged off. Although the loans have been partially charged off for financial statement purposes, the borrowers remain obligated to pay all contractual principal due, although there can be no assurance that such charged-off amounts will be collected. (4) See note 2 to the financial statements in this report for a discussion of these securities. (5) Represent modified loans as described in footnote 2 above, except that they were maintained on accrual status. All of these loans were performing and current and as of December 31, 2013, they had an aggregate weighted-average yield of 4.97%. (6) The amount at December 31, 2013 consisted of three loans that matured and as to which the borrowers were making monthly loan payments. The loans were in the process of being extended as of December 31, 2013. The table below summarizes the change in total loans on nonaccrual status for the periods indicated.

We review the estimated fair value of our portfolio of real estate owned through foreclosure at least quarterly by performing market valuations of the properties, which normally consist of obtaining externally prepared appraisals at least annually for every property, as well as performing quarterly reviews of economic and real estate market conditions in the local area where the property is located, including taking into consideration discussions with real estate brokers and interested buyers, in order to determine if a valuation allowance is needed to reflect any decrease in the estimated fair value of the property since acquisition. All of the properties owned at December 31, 2013 were being marketed for sale. 16 Table of Contents The table below summarizes the change in foreclosed real estate for the periods indicated.

Allowance for Loan Losses A detailed discussion of the factors that we use in computing the allowance for loan losses can be found in Item 7 under the caption Critical Accounting Policies in this report. The table below sets forth information regarding the activity in our allowance for loan losses.

See note 4 to the financial statements in this report. (2) The total amount of the allowance at December 31, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009, included a specific valuation allowance for impaired loans in the amount of $6.1 million, $5.9 million, $8.0 million, $7.2 million and $13.8 million, respectively. (3) Amounts for 2010 include a $73.4 million provision for loan losses and $82.2 million of chargeoffs recorded in connection with a bulk sale. In May 2010, we completed a large bulk sale in order to accelerate the reduction of our problem assets. We sold certain non- performing and underperforming loans and some real estate owned. The assets sold aggregated to approximately $207 million and consisted of $192.6 million of loans and $14.4 million of real estate. The assets were sold at a substantial discount to their then net carrying values of $197.7 million for net proceeds of $119.1 million. As a result of the bulk sale, we recorded a $78.7 million combined provision for loan and real estate losses, which contributed approximately $44 million, or 79%, to our net after tax loss of $55 million in 2010. For additional information and discussion on the allowance for loan losses, see note 4 the financial statements and the section entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report. Security Investment Activities Our security investments are normally purchased by INB and are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost when INB has the intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Historically, INB has invested in debt securities that are issued directly by the U.S. government or one of its agencies with short- to intermediate-maturity terms. INB has also, from time to time, purchased residential mortgage backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies. 17 Table of Contents INBs goal is to maintain a securities portfolio with a short weighted-average life of no more than five years, which allows for the resulting cash flows to either be reinvested in similar securities, used to fund loan commitments, pay off borrowings or fund deposit outflows as needed. INBs securities portfolio does not contain securities of any issuer with an aggregate book value and aggregate market value in excess of 10% of its stockholders equity, excluding those issued by the U.S. government or its agencies (see Item 1A Risk Factors). Our security investments carry market risk (insofar as increases in market interest rates would generally cause a decline in their market value), prepayment risk (insofar as they may be called or repaid before their stated maturity during times of low market interest rates and we may then have to reinvest the funds at a lower interest rate) and credit risk (insofar as they may default, particularly as it relates to our investments in corporate securities). INB may from time to time maintain an available-for-sale portfolio for securities that it will hold for indefinite periods of time that may sold in response to changes in interest rates or other factors, including asset/liability management strategies. We have never engaged in trading activities. We may also invest in other short-term instruments (including overnight and term federal funds, bank commercial paper and certificates of deposit) to temporarily invest excess cash flow generated from our deposit-gathering activities and operations. The table below summarizes the amortized cost (carrying value), contractual maturities and weighted-average yields of INBs portfolio of securities held to maturity. The table excludes Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRB) stock investments required to be held by INB in order for it to be a member of these institutions.

INBs deposit accounts are solicited from individuals, small businesses and professional firms located throughout INBs primary market areas through the offering of a variety of deposit products. INB also uses its internet web site www.intervestnatbank.com to attract deposit customers from both within and outside its primary market areas. INB believes it does not have a concentration of deposits from any one source. INBs deposit products include the following: certificates of deposit (including denominations of $100,000 or more); individual retirement accounts (IRAs); checking and other demand deposit accounts; negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts; savings accounts; and money market accounts. Interest rates offered by INB on deposit accounts are normally competitive with those in INBs primary market areas. The determination of rates and terms on deposit accounts also take into account INBs liquidity requirements, outstanding loan commitments, desired capital levels and government regulations. Maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties on deposit products are reviewed and established by INB on a periodic basis. INB also offers internet banking services, ATM services with access to local, state and national networks, wire transfers, automated clearing house (ACH) transfers, direct deposit of payroll and social security checks and automated drafts for various accounts. In addition, INB offers safe deposit boxes to its customers in Florida. INB periodically reviews the scope of the banking products and services it offers consistent with market opportunities and its available resources. INB relies heavily on certificates of deposit (time deposits) as its main source of funds from deposit accounts. See the sections Supervision and Regulation and Liquidity and Capital Resources in this report for additional information on deposits.

As a member of the FHLB and FRB, INB can borrow from these institutions on a secured basis using INBs security investments and certain loans as collateral. INB also has an agreement with two correspondent banks whereby it could borrow overnight a limited amount of funds on an unsecured basis. For additional information on FHLB advances and INBs lines of credit, see note 8 the financial statements in this report. IBCs historical sources of funds to meet its obligations have been derived from the following: interest income from short-term investments and a limited number of mortgage loans; monthly dividends from INB; and monthly management fees from INB for providing it with certain administrative services. IBCs historical sources of working capital have been derived from the issuance of its common stock through public or private offerings, exercise of its common stock warrants/options, the issuance of its trust preferred securities and preferred stock and the issuance of its subordinated debentures to the public. For additional information on stockholders equity and borrowed funds, see notes 9 and 10 to the financial statements in this report. Employees At December 31, 2013, we employed 81 full-time equivalent employees. We provide various benefits to our employees, including group life, health, dental and disability insurance, a 401(k) retirement plan and a long-term employee incentive plan. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. Federal and State Taxation IBC and its subsidiary file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined state and city income tax returns in New York. IBC also files a franchise tax return in Delaware. INB files a state income tax return in Florida. INB also files state tax returns, as needed, for certain entities that own title to real estate INB acquires through foreclosure. All the above returns are filed on a calendar year basis and we report our income and expenses using the accrual method of accounting. Consolidated income tax returns have the effect of eliminating intercompany income and expense, including dividends, from the computation of our taxable income for the taxable year in which the items occur. In accordance with an income tax sharing agreement, income tax charges or credits are allocated among IBC and its subsidiary on the basis of their respective taxable income or taxable loss that is included in our income tax returns. 20 Table of Contents Banks and bank holding companies are subject to federal and state income taxes in essentially the same manner as other corporations. Florida, New York State and New York City taxable income is calculated under applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), with some modifications required by state and city law. Although INBs federal income tax liability is determined under provisions of the Code, which is applicable to all taxpayers, Sections 581 through 597 of the Code apply specifically to financial institutions. In addition to the regular income tax, we are subject to a Federal alternative minimum tax, or AMT, in an amount equal to 20% of alternative minimum taxable income to the extent the AMT exceeds our regular income tax. The AMT is available as a credit against future regular income tax. New York State imposes an annual franchise tax on banking corporations, based on net income allocable to New York State. If, however, the application of an alternative minimum tax (based on taxable assets allocated to New York, alternative net income, or a flat minimum fee) results in a greater tax, an alternative minimum tax is imposed. We are also subject to the alternative minimum tax for New York City (which is similar to the New York State alternative minimum tax). As a Delaware corporation not earning income in Delaware, IBC is exempt from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware. The tax is imposed as a percentage of the capital base of IBC. See note 14 to the financial statements and the section Critical Accounting Policies in this report for a further discussion of income taxes and our deferred tax asset. Investment in Subsidiaries The following table provides information regarding IBCs consolidated subsidiary: At December 31, 2013 ($ in thousands) % of VotingStock Owned TotalInvestment IBCs Equityin Underlying Subsidiarys EarningsFor the Year Ended December 31, by IBC By IBC Net Assets 2013 2012 2011 Intervest National Bank 100 % $ 240,918 $ 240,918 $ 15,732 $ 13,494 $ 12,704 INB also has an ownership interest in a number of limited liability companies whose sole purpose is to own title to real estate INB acquires through foreclosure. These entities are normally dissolved when the properties are sold. Supervision and Regulation The supervision and regulation of banks or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the FDIC deposit insurance fund (DIF) and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of our stockholders or creditors. The regulatory agencies have broad enforcement power, including the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions and formal agreements, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provision or formal agreement. Any changes in the aforementioned may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Bank Holding Company Regulation IBC is a holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by FRB. The Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a broad range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Scope of Permissible Activities and a Source of Strength for Subsidiaries. A bank holding company generally may not engage in, or acquire or control, directly or indirectly, voting securities or assets of any company that is engaged in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks. A bank holding company must also serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. See the section Written Agreement below. Mergers and Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies. Subject to certain exceptions, a bank holding company is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before it may merge or consolidate with another bank holding company, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or, direct or indirect, ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company, if after such acquisition the bank holding company would control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting securities of such bank or bank holding company. 21 Table of Contents Anti-Tying Restrictions. Subject to certain exceptions, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. Capital Adequacy. The FRB has capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies that are based upon a risk-based capital determination, whereby a bank holding companys capital adequacy is determined by assigning different categories of assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. Bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets (leverage capital ratio) of at least 3% for strong banks and bank holding companies and a minimum leverage ratio of at least 4% for all other bank holding companies. At December 31, 2013, IBCs Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 19.95% and 21.21%, respectively, and its leverage capital ratio was 15.46%. See the caption entitled Basel III in this section for further discussion of capital requirements. Dividends. IBCs ability to pay cash dividends on its capital stock is dependent upon its level of cash on hand and upon the cash dividends received from INB. IBC must first pay its operating and interest expenses from funds it receives from its subsidiaries. As a result, stockholders may receive cash dividends from IBC only to the extent that funds are available after payment of the aforementioned expenses. In addition, the FRB generally prohibits a bank holding company from paying cash dividends except out of its net income, provided that the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank holding companys capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Since February 2010, IBC cannot, without the prior approval of the FRB, pay dividends on or redeem its capital stock, pay interest on or redeem its trust preferred securities, or incur new debt. See the sections Written Agreement and TARP below. Control Acquisitions. The Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the FRB has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Enforcement Authority. The FRB may impose civil or criminal penalties or may institute a cease-and-desist proceeding for the violation of applicable laws and regulations. IBC is also under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and various state securities commissions for matters related to the offering and sale of its securities, and is subject to the SEC rules and regulations relating to periodic reporting, reporting to shareholders, proxy solicitation and insider trading. IBCs common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and, as a result, IBC is also subject to the rules of Nasdaq for listed companies. Written Agreement. In January 2011, IBC entered into a written agreement (the Federal Reserve Agreement) with its primary regulator, the FRB, which requires IBCs Board of Directors to take the steps necessary to utilize IBCs financial and managerial resources to serve as a source of strength to INB, including causing INB to comply with its Formal Agreement with its primary regulator, the OCC (which agreement was terminated by the OCC in March 2013). In addition, as noted earlier, IBC cannot declare or pay dividends without the prior approval of the FRB and the Director of the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation of the Board of Governors (the Banking Director). IBC also cannot take any payments representing a reduction in capital from INB without prior approval of the FRB and IBC cannot not make any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on its subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities without prior approval from the FRB and the Banking Director. Further, IBC may not incur, increase or guarantee any debt or purchase or redeem any shares of its stock without prior approval of the FRB. IBC was also required within 90 days of the date of the Federal Reserve Agreement to submit a plan to continue to maintain sufficient capital. Finally, IBC must notify the FRB when appointing any new director or senior executive officer or changing responsibilities of any senior executive officer, and IBC is also restricted in making certain severance and indemnification payments. We believe we have taken all necessary actions to promptly address the requirements of the Federal Reserve Agreement and that IBC is in compliance with such agreement as of the date of filing of this report. The FRB has advised IBC that the FRB is reviewing the need for the Federal Reserve Agreement. 22 Table of Contents TARP. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) established the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP gave the U.S. Treasury authority to deploy up to $750 billion into the U.S. financial system with an objective of improving liquidity in the capital markets. In October 2008, Treasury announced plans to direct $250 billion of this authority into preferred stock investments in banks. On December 23, 2008, IBC voluntarily applied for and was approved to participate in the above program and sold to the Treasury 25,000 shares of IBCs newly issued Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, along with a ten year warrant to purchase at any time up to 691,882 shares of IBCs common stock for $5.42 per share, for a total cash investment of $25 million from the Treasury. In 2013, IBC repurchased and/or redeemed the entire amount of Series A Preferred Stock and those shares were cancelled. At December 31, 2013, the Treasury continued to hold the warrant referenced above. See note 10 to the financial statements in this report for a further discussion. Bank Regulation INB is a nationally chartered bank that is subject to regulation and examination by the OCC, its primary regulator, and by virtue of the insurance of INBs deposits, it is also subject to the supervision and regulation of the FDIC. Because INB is a member of the Federal Reserve System, it is subject to regulation pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act. In addition, because the FRB regulates IBC, the FRB also has supervisory authority that directly affects INB. The FDIC and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including, but not limited to, the power to terminate deposit insurance and impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties. Transactions with Affiliates. Under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, subject to certain exemptions, INB may engage in a transaction with an affiliate, as such term is defined therein, only if the aggregate amount of the transactions with one affiliate or with all affiliates does not exceed 10% or 20%, respectively, of the capital stock and surplus of INB. INB is also generally prohibited from purchasing a low-quality asset from an affiliate. Any transaction between INB and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Additionally, transactions with affiliates, can only be made on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to INB, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies, or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies. Loans to One Borrower. INB generally may not make loans or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, up to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2013, INB was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations. Loans to Insiders. INB is prohibited from extending credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests, collectively referred to as insiders, unless the extension of credit is made on substantially the same terms and in accordance with underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons. INB as a matter of policy does not extend such credit and there were no such loans outstanding at December 31, 2013. Reserve Requirements. Pursuant to Regulation D, INB must hold a percentage of certain types of deposits as reserves in the form of vault cash, as a deposit in a Federal Reserve Bank or as a deposit in a pass-through account at a correspondent institution. Dividends. When INB pays cash dividends on its capital stock its pays them to IBC as the sole shareholder of INB. INBs dividend policy is to pay dividends at levels consistent with maintaining its desired liquidity and capital ratios and debt servicing obligations. INBs board of directors may declare dividends to be paid out of INBs undivided profits. No dividends may be paid by INB without the OCCs approval if the total amount of all dividends, including the proposed dividend, declared by INB in any calendar year exceeds INBs total retained net income for that year, combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years. Also, INB may not declare or pay any dividends if, after making the dividend, INB would be undercapitalized and no dividend may be paid by INB if it is in default of any deposit insurance assessment due to the FDIC. 23 Table of Contents Capital Adequacy. In general, capital adequacy regulations for national banks such as INB, are similar to the FRB guidelines discussed earlier. Under the OCCs current regulations and guidelines as of December 31, 2013, all banks must maintain minimum ratios of capital as follows: Tier 1 capital to total average assets (leverage ratio) - 4%; Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets - 4%; and total capital to risk-weighted assets - 8%. At December 31, 2013, INBs leverage capital ratio, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 15.23%, 19.65% and 20.91%, respectively. INB was considered a well-capitalized bank at December 31, 2013. Prompt Corrective Action. Federal banking agencies have the authority to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Applicable regulations divide banks into five different categories, depending on their level of capital: (i) well-capitalized; (ii) adequately capitalized; (iii) undercapitalized; (iv) significantly undercapitalized; and (v) critically undercapitalized. A bank is deemed to be well-capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or more and a leverage ratio of 5% or more, and the bank is not subject to an order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level. Interest Rate and Brokered Deposit Restrictions. Financial institutions that are less than well capitalized are barred from paying interest on their deposit products at rates of interest in excess of 75 basis points above the national rate unless it receives an exemption from the FDIC that the institutions local market rate is above the national rate. In addition, they cannot accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits without approval from their primary regulator. At December 31, 2013, INB was considered well-capitalized. Deposit Insurance Assessments. INBs deposits are insured up to applicable limits through the FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. Insured institutions are required to pay insurance premiums based on the risk each institution poses to DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to raise or lower assessment rates on insured deposits, subject to limits, and to impose special additional assessments. The FDIC can terminate a depository institutions deposit insurance if it finds that the institution is being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner or has violated any rule, regulation, order or condition administered by the institutions regulatory authorities. Any termination of deposit insurance would have a material adverse effect on INB. The FDIC insurance assessment base is defined as average total assets minus tangible equity. In addition to deposit liabilities, the base contains certain liabilities. Assessment rates assigned to institutions depend on the instructions regulatory exam ratings and other risk measures. Banks are assigned to one of four risk categories based on two criteria: capital adequacy and supervisory ratings. The three capital groups are well-capitalized, adequately capitalized and undercapitalized, consistent with prompt corrective action designations. The three supervisory groups are based primarily on CAMELS ratings, although the FDIC has the ability to consider other factors as well. In general, banks with CAMELS ratings of 1 or 2 are assigned to the A category, banks with a CAMELS rating of 3 are assigned to the B category, and banks with a CAMELS rating of 4 or 5 are assigned to the C category. The base assessment rates range from 5 basis points for the lowest risk category to 35 basis points for the highest risk category, with further adjustments (plus or minus) thereto based on an institutions level of unsecured debt and brokered deposits, which make the total assessment rates range from 2.5 basis points to a high of 45 basis points. INBs assessment rate for its most recent billing period ended December 31, 2013 was 14 basis points. In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, institutions are also required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund, which payment is established and changes quarterly. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2017 to 2019. Community Reinvestment. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977, INB must assist in meeting the credit needs of the communities in its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low and moderate-income individuals and neighborhoods. The FDIC applies the lending, investment and service tests to assess a banks CRA performance and assigns to a bank a rating of outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve, or substantial noncompliance on the basis of the banks performance under these tests. All banks are required to publicly disclose their CRA performance ratings. INBs latest CRA rating was satisfactory. 24 Table of Contents Regulation of Lending Activity. In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above, INB is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974, and their associated Regulations Z, X and B, respectively. Monetary Policy and Economic Control. Commercial banking is affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary policies of the FRB. Changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing, availability of borrowing at the discount window, open market operations, the imposition of changes in reserve requirements against member banks deposits and assets of foreign branches and the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB. These monetary policies are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distributions of bank loans, investments and deposits, and this use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies of the FRB, which have a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks, are influenced by various factors, including inflation, unemployment, short-term and long-term changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the United States Government. Other Legislation Affecting Us The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 facilitates the interstate expansion and consolidation of banking organizations by permitting bank holding companies that are adequately capitalized and managed to acquire banks located in states outside their home states regardless of whether such acquisitions are authorized under the law of the host state. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, among other things, permits banks, securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate under a common holding company structure, but imposes certain restrictions concerning collection, disclosure and safeguarding of customer information. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 requires financial institutions to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and financing of terrorism. Financial institutions are required to collect customer information, monitor transactions and report certain information to U.S. law enforcement agencies, such as the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) concerning customers and their transactions. INB has systems and procedures in place designed to comply with the USA Patriot Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed a myriad of corporate governance and accounting measures designed so that shareholders have full, accurate and timely information about the public companies in which they invest. All public companies are affected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) of 2010 imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes, including the imposition of increased capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness within, the financial services sector. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies are prohibited from including in their Tier 1 regulatory capital certain hybrid debt and equity securities issued on or after May 19, 2010. Among the securities included in this prohibition are trust preferred securities (TRUPS), which IBC has used in the past as a tool for raising Tier 1 capital. IBC is permitted to continue to include its existing outstanding TRUPS in its Tier 1 capital. Under FRB requirements, the amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and qualifying TRUPS, as well as certain types of minority interest, that may be included as Tier 1 capital is limited to 25 percent of the sum of core capital elements net of goodwill. Additionally, the excess amounts of restricted core capital elements in the form of qualifying TRUPS included in Tier 2 capital is limited to 50 percent of Tier 1 capital (net of goodwill). However, amounts in excess of this limit will still be taken into account in the overall assessment of an organizations funding and financial condition. In the last five years before the underlying subordinated note matures, the associated TRUPS must be treated as limited-life preferred stock. Thus, in the last five years of the life of the note, the outstanding amount of TRUPS is excluded from Tier 1 capital and included in Tier 2 capital, subject, together with subordinated debt and other limited-life preferred stock, to a limit of 50 percent of Tier 1 capital. During this period, the TRUPS will be amortized out of Tier 2 capital by one-fifth of the original amount less redemptions each year and excluded totally from Tier 2 capital during the last year of life of the underlying note. 25 Table of Contents Basel III. On July 2, 2013, the federal banking regulators approved the final proposed rules that revise the regulatory capital rules to incorporate certain revisions by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to the Basel capital framework (Basel III). The phase-in period for the final rules will begin for us on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with the final rules phased in on January 1, 2019. The final rules, among other things, include a new common equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) to risk-weighted assets ratio, including a capital conservation buffer, which will gradually increase from 4.5% on January 1, 2015 to 7.0% on January 1, 2019. The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% on January 1, 2015 to 8.5% on January 1, 2019, as well as require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. The final rules also require that certain non-qualifying capital instruments, including TRUPS, be phased out of Tier 1 capital (as denoted on the previous page), except that bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009 will be grandfathered and may continue to include trust preferred security debt issuances in Tier 1 capital, subject to certain restrictions. Since IBC had less than $15 billion in assets at December 31, 2009, it will continue to include its existing $55 million of TRUPS in its Tier 1 regulatory capital computations. The final rules also provide for a number of adjustments to and deductions from the new CET1. Under current capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital are excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under Basel III, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded. However, certain banking organizations, including IBC and INB, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. IBC and INB expect to make this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of INBs investment securities portfolio. We are currently evaluating the provisions of the final rules and their expected impact. We believe that we would have been in compliance with Basel III requirements if they had been effective as of December 31, 2013. Other Regulation - Mortgage Lending Multifamily properties may be subject to rent control and rent stabilization laws, which may restrict the owner from raising rents on apartments. If real estate taxes, fuel costs and maintenance of and repairs to the property were to increase substantially, and such increases are not offset by increases in rental income, the ability of the owner of the property to make payments due on the loan might be adversely affected. Laws and regulations relating to asbestos require that whenever any work is undertaken in a property in an area in which asbestos is present, the asbestos must be removed or encapsulated in accordance with such and laws and regulations. The cost of asbestos removal or encapsulation may be substantial, and if there were not sufficient cash flow from the property, after debt service on mortgages, to fund the required work, and the owner of the property fails to fund such work from other sources, the value of the property could be adversely affected, with consequent impairment of the security for the mortgage. Laws and regulations relating to the storage, disposal and clean up of hazardous or toxic substances at real property have been adopted. Such laws may impose a lien on the real property superior to any mortgages on the property. In the event such a lien was imposed on any property which serves as security for a mortgage owned by us, the security for such mortgage could be impaired. Our lending business is regulated by federal, state and, in certain cases, local laws, including, but not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 and Regulation B. We are also subject to various other federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations governing, among other things, the licensing of mortgage lenders and servicers. We must comply with procedures mandated for mortgage lenders and servicers, and must provide disclosures to certain borrowers. Failure to comply with these laws, as well as with the laws described above, may result in civil and criminal liability, termination or suspension of licenses, rights of rescission for mortgage loans, lawsuits and/or administrative enforcement actions. Additional legislative and regulatory proposals have been made and others can be expected. It is not possible to predict whether or in what form final proposals may be adopted and, if adopted, what their effect will be on us. 26 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors contain important information about us and our business and should be read in their entirety. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we now believe to be not material could also impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly. Risks Related to Our Business Difficult economic and market conditions have adversely affected us and our industry. Since the end of 2007, we have been negatively impacted by a weak economy, high rates of unemployment, increased office and retail vacancy rates and lower commercial real estate values both nationally and in our primary markets, New York and Florida, all of which have resulted in a significant increase in our nonperforming assets and associated loan and real estate loss provisions and expenses to carry these assets. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, our business and operating results are closely tied to the local economic conditions and commercial real estate values in New York and Florida. From December 2007 to June 2009, the United States experienced the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. This period was marked by reduced business activity across a wide range of industries and regions, significant increases in unemployment, volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, and dramatic declines in the housing market, with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures, which negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and resulted in significant write-downs of assets by many financial institutions across the United States. The recession was also marked by tightening of the credit markets and steep declines in the stock markets, which resulted in a difficult loan environment and decreased the value of our portfolio of investment securities. Although the domestic economy continued its modest recovery during 2013, the recovery is weak and there can be no assurance that the economy will not enter into another recession, whether in the near or long term. Furthermore, real estate values and the demand for commercial real estate loans have not fully recovered, and reduced availability of commercial credit and continuing unemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit. Additional market developments such as a relapse or worsening of economic conditions in Europe would likely exacerbate the lingering effects of the difficult market conditions experienced by us and others in the financial services industry and could further slow, stall or reverse the slow recovery in the U.S., all of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business strategy may not be successful. Our business strategy (discussed under Item 1 Business in this report) is focused on attracting deposits by offering competitive interest rates and using those deposits and other funds generated from our operations to originate commercial and multi-family real estate loans on a profitable basis. Our ability to execute this strategy depends on many factors, including some outside of our control, such as the state of economic conditions generally and in our market areas in particular, interest rate trends, the state of credit markets, real estate values, loan demand, competition, government regulations, regulatory restrictions and regulatory capital requirements. We may not be successful in maintaining or increasing the level of our loans or deposits at an acceptable risk or on profitable terms, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. We depend on a limited number of executive officers to implement our business strategy. Mr. Lowell Dansker, age 63, our Chairman, and Mr. Keith Olsen, age 60, President of INB, with oversight from both INBs and IBCs Board of Directors and its Committees, make all of our strategic decisions for us, including all of our underwriting, lending and investment decisions. This includes determining which types of loans are suitable for us, geographical locations to lend in, setting the terms and rates on all loans, determining our funding types and rates to offer on deposits, and investing our funds not used for loan originations into the security investments. 27 Table of Contents The ultimate success of our business strategy is directly related to the expertise and judgments of these two executive officers and our business may suffer if we lose their services or their judgments prove to be incorrect. If Mr. Dansker or Mr. Olsen or any of our other key employees (as disclosed in Executive Officers and Other Significant Employees included at the end of Part I of this report) were to become unavailable for any reason, our business may be adversely affected and, in the case of Mr. Dansker and Mr. Olsen, particularly due to their skills and knowledge of the real estate markets in which we operate, their years of lending experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel to execute our current business strategy. To attract and retain qualified personnel, we offer various employee benefits, including an executive employment agreement for Mr. Dansker. We also have a written succession plan that identifies key internal officers to perform executive officer functions in case of temporary disruptions due to such things as illnesses or leaves of absence. This plan also contains procedures for the selection of permanent replacements, if any. The plan, however, may not be effective and we may not be able to ultimately attract and retain qualified personnel. Competition for qualified personnel may also increase our hiring and retention costs. All of the above factors could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We depend on brokers for our loan originations. We rely on referrals from real estate mortgage brokers for our loan origination volume. If those referrals were to decline or not expand, other sources of loan originations may not be available to us, which may cause our business to suffer and negatively impact our operating results. We face strong competition in our market areas. Our primary markets consist of New York and Florida, which are highly competitive markets. We experience competition in both lending and attracting deposits from other banks and nonbanks (including savings associations, credit unions, securities firms, investment bankers, money market funds, life insurance companies and the mutual fund industry) some of which are significantly larger institutions with greater resources, lower cost of funds or a more established market presence. Because our business directly depends on our ability to attract deposits and originate loans profitably, our ability to efficiently compete for depositors and borrowers is critical to our success. Our operating results could suffer if we are not able to successfully compete in these markets. Our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate. Our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate, which increases the risk associated with our loan portfolio. Such loans are generally considered riskier than many other kinds of loans, like single family residential real estate loans, since these loans tend to involve larger loan balances to one borrower or groups of related borrowers, and repayment of such loans is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the underlying real estate. Additionally, we also have some loans secured by vacant or substantially vacant properties as well as some vacant land, all of which typically do not have adequate or any income streams and depend upon other sources of cash flow from the borrower for repayment. As discussed in Item 1 Business in this report, over the past several years, due to various factors, a large number of the loans we originated prior to 2010 have been repaid through refinancing by other institutions. Our new loan originations, moreover, have been more weighted towards commercial real estate loans. Our total commercial real estate loans (inclusive of land loans) as a percentage of our total loans was 75% at December 31, 2013, while our multifamily loans (inclusive of loans on investor owned residential condominiums) as a percentage of total loans was 25% at December 31, 2013. We cannot predict how long this trend will continue. For a further discussion of our lending risks, see the section Item 1 Business under the caption Lending Activities in this report. All of our loans require ongoing evaluation and monitoring since they may be negatively affected to a greater degree by adverse conditions in the real estate markets or the economy or changes in government regulation. A number of our borrowers also have more than one mortgage loan outstanding with us. Likewise, these borrowers may also own other properties that are encumbered by separate mortgages from other lenders. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to the borrower may expose us to a greater risk of loss with respect to our otherwise performing loans with the same borrower. 28 Table of Contents Furthermore, banking regulators are giving commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny and banks with higher levels of these loans are expected to have effective underwriting and risk management policies, perform portfolio stress testing, maintain higher levels of loan loss and higher regulatory capital levels. Regardless of the effectiveness of the lending policies and procedures we utilize, we may experience lending losses as a result of factors beyond our control, including changes in market and economic conditions affecting the value of our loan collateral and problems affecting the credit and business of our borrowers. Our ability to recover our investment in the mortgage loans we originate is ultimately dependent on the market value of the collateral property. Many of the loans we originate permit no recourse or limited recourse against the propertys owner. Even with personal recourse, successful collection is still difficult to achieve. In addition, our losses in connection with delinquent loans may be more pronounced because our commercial and multifamily real estate mortgage loans generally have amortization schedules, which are common to the banking industry, that result in limited principal reduction during the life of the loan and consequently, a substantial part of the loans original principal amount is due at maturity. All of the above factors could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Many of the properties securing our loans are concentrated in New York and Florida and in areas that are undergoing revitalization or are vacant or substantially vacant. The properties securing our loans at December 31, 2013 are concentrated in New York (59%) and Florida (28%), and more recently we have originated a greater amount of loans outside of these two states (13%), predominantly the Mid-Atlantic and South East Coast and some in the Midwest. Additionally, we have and will continue to lend in geographical areas of all of these states that are in the process of being revitalized or redeveloped or considered secondary or tertiary markets, all of which can be negatively impacted to a greater degree in an economic downturn or real estate slump. A large number of the properties we lend on may also need repair and or improvements, have below market rents, or may be vacant or substantially vacant and are in the process of being rented. Properties securing loans of this type and in these types of neighborhoods may be more susceptible to fluctuations in value and have higher default rates than properties in more established areas. All of the above increases the risk associated with our loan portfolio. The properties securing our loans may be negatively impacted by storms, natural disasters and other factors. Florida is especially susceptible to hurricanes and tropical storms and related flooding and wind damage, as well as other disasters. The Northeast can also be affected by hurricanes and other natural disasters. Such weather and environmental events can disrupt business, result in damage to properties and negatively affect the local economy, all of which may adversely affect the cash flows, values and marketability of properties that secure our loans. Furthermore, hurricane and other storm damage have increased the cost of property and casualty insurance premiums, especially in Florida. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage may be caused by the occurrence of such events. Such events could affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, could impair the value of the collateral securing our loans, and could cause significant property damage, thus increasing our expenses and/or reducing our revenues. Other factors, such as political issues, including armed conflicts and acts of terrorism, may have an adverse impact on economic conditions of the country as a whole and may be more pronounced in specific geographic regions, which could negatively affect the market value of the mortgaged properties underlying our loans as well as the levels of rent and occupancy of income-producing properties. Since a large number of properties underlying our loans are located in New York City, we may be more vulnerable to the adverse impact of such occurrences than other institutions, which could have a significant negative impact on us. All of the above could increase the risk associated with our loan portfolio and could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures or loan and real estate losses, all of which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. 29 Table of Contents We are required to maintain strong and effective loan management and monitoring systems. Bank regulators require banks with concentrations of assets to have management, policies, procedures and systems appropriate to manage these risks, especially where the real estate loans are concentrated geographically or in particular lines of business. Because of our high concentration in loans secured by commercial real estate (inclusive of multifamily properties, vacant land and loans on investor owned 1-4 family condominiums), we are required to maintain strong loan management and monitoring systems as a result of the perceived risks of our concentration in commercial and multifamily real estate loans. We have and will continue to add personnel and incur increased costs of consultants and other third parties to maintain effective loan monitoring systems, all of which has and will continue to increase our operating expenses. Our loans are relatively short-term and have balloon payments at maturity. We generally originate short-term real estate mortgage loans that have balloon payments at maturity. Our borrowers are expected to have to refinance their loans at maturity or payoff the loans at maturity from other sources of cash or from sales of the underlying collateral property. We are therefore subject to the risks that our borrowers will not be able to repay us or refinance their loans due to adverse conditions in their businesses, unavailability of alternative financing, or an inability to timely sell the property securing our loan. These conditions also reduce the rate of payoffs on our loans, which may negatively impact our liquidity. In addition, any disruptions in the credit markets or other lenders diversification away from commercial real estate or multifamily lending as well as declines in real estate values may increase our delinquent and nonperforming loans, foreclosures and the potential for future losses. Problem assets also increase our expenses and take additional time and effort to manage. All of the above could adversely affect our earnings, credit quality and liquidity. We currently have an elevated level of problems assets. Although we have successfully reduced our problem assets over the last several years, as discussed elsewhere in this report, we currently have an elevated level of problem assets (nonperforming loans, TDRs, real estate owned through foreclosure, and other performing loans rated substandard for which there were concerns regarding the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms), which increases the risk associated with our company and business. The timing and amount of the resolution and/or disposition of all these assets cannot be predicted with certainty. Many of our TDRs will continue to be classified as such until they are repaid. In addition, our ability to complete foreclosure or other proceedings, if necessary, to acquire and sell certain collateral properties in many cases can be delayed by various factors outside of our control. We may be required to sell these, as well as other new nonaccrual or problem assets that may arise in the future, at a loss compared to their current net carrying values. Moreover, a sustained and prolonged economic and real estate downturn could further adversely affect the quality of our assets, increase our nonperforming assets, increase our loan and real estate losses and related carrying expenses, and could also reduce the demand for our products and services and our ability to attract deposits, all of which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We may have higher loan and real estate losses than we have allowed for. We maintain an allowance for loan losses and a valuation allowance for real estate losses that we believe are adequate and reflect the amount of losses inherent in our loan and real estate owned portfolios at a specific point in time. The allowances, however, ultimately may not be adequate to protect us against actual losses that we may sustain. There is a risk that we may experience losses that could exceed the allowances we have set aside. In determining the size of the allowances, we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and the estimated market values of the underlying collateral properties and of real estate owned, which are discussed under the caption Critical Accounting Policies in this report. If our assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect, we may have to increase these allowances or replenish them after chargeoffs by recording additional loss provisions. Furthermore, our regulators may require us to make additional provisions for loan and real estate losses after their periodic review of these portfolios and related allowances based solely on their judgments. All of the above could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 30 Table of Contents We are subject to the risks and costs associated with owning real estate. From time to time, we need to foreclose on the properties that collateralize our mortgage loans that are in default as a means of repayment and may thereafter own and operate such properties for an extended period of time, which expose us to risks and costs inherent in the ownership of real estate. Costs associated with the ownership of real estate (principally real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs) may exceed the rental income earned from the property, if any, and we may therefore have to advance additional funds to operate and or maintain the property in order protect our investment. Further, hazardous substances could be discovered on the properties and we may be required to remove the substances from and remediate the properties at our expense, which could be substantial. All of the above factors could also adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The credit downgrade of U.S. government securities could have a material adverse effect on us. Like most financial institutions, we own a large amount of investments in debt instruments issued by U.S. government agencies. The continuing debates in Congress regarding the national debt ceiling, federal budget deficit concerns, and overall weakness in the economy resulted in recent actual and threatened downgrades of U.S. government securities by the various major credit ratings agencies, including Standard and Poors and Fitch Ratings. While the federal banking agencies including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued guidance indicating that, for risk-based capital purposes, the risk weights for U.S. Treasury securities and other securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, government agencies, and government-sponsored entities will not be affected by the downgrade, the possible future downgrade of the federal governments credit rating by one or both of the other two major rating agencies could create uncertainty in the U.S. and global financial markets. We cannot predict if, when or how these changes or future changes to the credit ratings will affect economic conditions. However, these or future rating downgrades could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results, and could exacerbate other risks described in this report. We need to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity. Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, repayments of loans, or other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations. In addition to deposits, our primary funding sources include unsecured federal funds that we purchase from correspondent banks as well as secured advances, both short- and longer-term, that are available from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with the use of our investment securities and certain loans that can be pledged as collateral. Other sources of liquidity that may be available to us, but cannot be assured, include our ability to issue and sell debentures and capital stock in public or private transactions. It should be noted that volatility in the capital and credit markets can produce downward pressure on stock prices and reduced credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial condition or performance. These factors could have material adverse effects on our ability to access capital or credit and on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our access to adequate amounts of funding sources on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Our ability to borrow could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets, adverse changes in the financial condition of our correspondent banks that supply us with federal funds, or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the credit markets. Regulatory requirements for greater liquidity may also adversely affect our profitability. Our current level of liquidity sources may not be adequate, or may be adversely affected in the future, which may reduce the availability of funds to us, all of which could negatively affect our operations and business and ability to be a going concern. Our business is greatly impacted by changes in interest rates. As a financial institution, we are subject to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. A significant change in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, which depends primarily on the generation of net interest income. Our net interest income is dependent on our interest rate spread, which is the difference between yields earned on our interest-earning assets and the rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. 31 Table of Contents As a result, our success depends directly on our ability to invest a substantial percentage of our assets in mortgage loans with rates of return that exceed our cost of funds. Our loan portfolio was nearly all comprised of loans with fixed rates and the portfolio had an average weighted life of 4.6 years as of December 31, 2013. Our current portfolio of investment securities and overnight investments were short-term and their yield substantially less than our loans and we expect that to be the case in the future. Fluctuations in interest rates are difficult to predict and manage and, therefore, we may not be able to maintain an adequate positive interest rate spread. Historically, we have also not used any hedging strategies or other similar tools to manage our interest rate risk. For a further discussion of our management of interest rate risk, see the caption entitled Asset and Liability Management included in Item 7 of this report. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings, our cost of funds, loan demand, and the value of our collateral and investment securities, all of which could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition. We have a higher cost of funds and a high level of indebtedness. INB relies heavily on higher-cost certificates of deposit (time deposits) as its main source of funds and it needs to pay competitive interest rates to attract and retain all of its deposit accounts regardless of type to fund our loan originations. INBs high cost of funds or inability to pay competitive interest rates in the future to attract deposits could negatively affect our results of operations and business. Our borrowed funds (exclusive of deposits) and related interest payable was approximately $58 million at December 31, 2013 and is described in notes 8 and 9 to our financial statements. This level of indebtedness could make it difficult for us to satisfy all of our obligations to the holders of our debt and could limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing to fund our working capital requirements. The inability to incur additional indebtedness could adversely affect our business and financial condition by, among other things, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our industry; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to our competitors who may operate on a less leveraged basis. As a result, this may make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. All the above may adversely affect our financial condition and our business. We are subject to reputational risk and social factors. Our ability to attract and retain depositors and customers is highly dependent upon consumer and other external perceptions of either or both of our business practices and financial condition. Adverse perceptions could damage our reputation to a level that could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining deposit accounts, accessing credit markets and increased regulatory scrutiny on our business. Borrower payment behaviors also affect us. To the extent that borrowers determine to stop paying on their loans where the financed properties market values are less than the amount of their loan, or otherwise, our costs and losses may increase. Adverse developments or perceptions regarding the business practices or financial condition of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, may also indirectly adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse reputational impacts on third parties with whom we have important relationships may also adversely impact our reputation. All of the above factors may result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that may change or constrain the manner in which we engage with our customers and the products we offer and may also increase our litigation risk, all of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Regulatory Risks Our business is subject to extensive regulation. We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies, whose focus is to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund and depositors, not our stockholders. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. We are also subject to regulatory capital requirements, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth. If we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, our ability to grow, our cost of funds and FDIC insurance could be materially and adversely affected. See the section Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this report for a further discussion. All of the above could limit or restrict our business activities and the cost of compliance is currently high and may be higher in the future. 32 Table of Contents Non-compliance with laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions or other adverse consequences. Financial institutions like us are required under the USA PATRIOT Act and Bank Secrecy Act to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if such activities are detected. These rules also require established procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply with these regulations could result in fines or penalties, intervention or sanctions by regulators, and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. Although we have developed policies and procedures and systems designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, it is possible for such safeguards to fail or prove deficient during the implementation phase to avoid non-compliance with such laws, all of which could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability. IBC relies on cash dividends from INB to meet its obligations. IBC is a separate and distinct legal entity from INB. IBC has raised working capital in the past through the sale of capital stock and debentures and has down streamed the proceeds from such transactions to INB as capital investments. IBC needs cash dividend payments from IBC to fund the interest payments on IBCs outstanding debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that a bank may pay to its parent company as described in more detail under the caption Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this report. If INB is unable to pay dividends to IBC for any reason, IBC in turn may not be able to service its debt, pay its other obligations, or pay cash dividends on its capital stock, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. IBC is operating under a formal written agreement with its primary regulator. Since January 2011, IBC has been operating under a written agreement with its primary regulator, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the FRB). The agreement, among other things, requires IBC to use its financial and managerial resources to serve as a source of strength to INB. In addition, the agreement, among other things, requires IBC to obtain approval from the FRB to do any of the following: (1) declare or pay dividends on its capital stock; (2) take any payments from INB that represent a reduction in INBs capital; (3) make any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on IBCs outstanding debt (subordinated debentures); and (4) incur, increase or guarantee any debt or purchase or redeem any shares of IBCs capital stock. As of the filing date of this report, IBC remained subject to this written agreement with the FRB and the restrictions contained therein, including those described above. IBC has advised the FRB that in IBCs view it has complied with all of the requirements of the written agreement. IBC further advised the FRB that INBs Formal Agreement with the OCC was terminated by the OCC in March 2013. The FRB is currently reviewing the need for its written agreement with IBC. The FRB agreement and its restrictions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. Accounting, Systems and Internal Control Risks Changes in accounting standards may affect our performance. Our accounting policies and procedures are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and operating results. Almost annually, there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we and the rest of the industry record and report its financial condition and operating results. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has and continues to issue a large number of accounting standards that necessarily require all companies to exercise significant judgment and interpretation in the application of those standards. For example, banks now need to use significant judgment when assessing the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities sitting on their balance sheets even though market values can change rapidly and may not be representative due to the inactivity of certain markets. Furthermore, these judgments and estimates could lead to inaccuracy and/or incomparability of financial statements due to differing conclusions on the same facts and circumstances. Future changes in financial accounting and reporting standards, including marking all our assets and liabilities to market values, could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and even require us to restate prior period financial statements. 33 Table of Contents The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition. We necessarily make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements. The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact our operating results and financial condition. For a further discussion, see the caption Critical Accounting Policies in this report. Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may not allow us to be able to accurately report our financial condition, operating results or prevent fraud. We regularly review and update our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. We maintain controls and procedures to mitigate against risks such as processing system failures and errors, and customer or employee fraud. We maintain insurance coverage for certain of these risks. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Events could occur which are not prevented or detected by our internal controls or are not insured against or are in excess of our insurance limits. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We are subject to security and operational risks relating to our use of technology that could damage our reputation and our business. We rely on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Furthermore, we have access to large amounts of confidential financial information and control substantial financial assets, including those belonging to our customers, to whom we offer remote access, and we regularly transfer substantial financial assets by electronic means. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of our systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage, our security measures may not be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints caused by third parties that facilitate our business activities by providing technology such as software applications, as well as financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. We also face the potential risk of losses due to fraud, including commercial checking account fraud, automated teller machine (ATM) skimming and trapping, write-offs necessitated by debit card fraud, and other forms of online banking fraud, which are being more sophisticated and present new challenges as mobile banking increases, as well as employee fraud. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, and if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 34 Table of Contents The operations of our business, including our interaction with customers, are increasingly done via electronic means, and this has increased our risks related to cybersecurity. We are exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks in the normal course of business. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. We have observed an increased level of attention in the industry focused on cyber-attacks that include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as by causing denial-of-service attacks on websites. Cyber-attacks may be carried out by third parties or insiders using techniques that range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security or overwhelm websites to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access. The objectives of cyber-attacks vary widely and can include theft of financial assets, intellectual property, or other sensitive information, including the information belonging to our banking customers. Cyber-attacks may also be directed at disrupting our operations. While we have not incurred any material losses related to cyber-attacks, nor are we aware of any specific or threatened cyber-incidents as of the date of this report, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences if we fall victim to successful cyber-attacks. Such negative consequences could include remediation costs that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repairing system damage that may have been caused; increased cybersecurity protection costs that may include organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants; lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack; litigation; and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence. We continually encounter technological change. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven by products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.
