ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact our business. You should carefully consider the following discussion of risks, and the other information provided in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impact our business. THE GAMING INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCREASED COMPETITION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS The gaming industry is highly competitive. As competitive pressures from California Native American casinos increase, other Reno area casinos may intensify their targeting of the Reno area resident market, which is one of our key markets. Increased competitive pressures in the local market could adversely impact our ability to continue to attract local residents to the Atlantis, or require us to use more expensive and therefore less profitable promotions to compete more efficiently. Several Native American casinos have opened in Northern California since passage of the constitutional amendment. Certain experienced Nevada gaming operators manage Indian casino facilities near Sacramento, one of Reno's key feeder markets. One major facility near Sacramento has been operating since June 2003 and has been very successful, adversely impacting many hotel casinos in Reno. Central and Northern California gaming facilities could provide an alternative to Reno area casinos, especially during certain winter periods when auto travel through the Sierra Nevadas is hampered. This loss of California drive-in customers could adversely effect our operations. We also believe that the legalization of unlimited land-based casino gaming in or near any major metropolitan area in the Atlantis' key non-Reno marketing areas, such as San Francisco or Sacramento, could have a material adverse impact on our business. In June 2004, five California Indian tribes signed compacts with the state that allows the tribes to increase the number of slot machines beyond the previous 2,000-per-tribe limit in exchange for higher fees from each of the five tribes. The State of California hopes to sign similar compacts with more Indian tribes. The resulting increase in the number of slot machines permitted in California Native American Casinos could further adversely impact Reno area casino operations and our operations. Other states are also considering legislation enabling the development and operation of casinos or casino-like operations. In addition, Native American gaming facilities in California and other jurisdictions in some instances operate under regulatory requirements less stringent than those imposed on Nevada licensed casinos, which could afford them a competitive advantage in our markets. Moreover, increases in the popularity of, and competition from, Internet and other account wagering gaming services, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. -16- OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY EXPANDED NATIVE AMERICAN GAMING OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST Our largest source of leisure traveler customers is California and the Pacific Northwest, including a large number who drive to Reno from the San Francisco and Sacramento metropolitan areas. Since 1999, several large-scale Native American-owned casino facilities have commenced operations in that state, some of which are located close to our key markets. The increased competition from these facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business. OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF THE RENO ECONOMY DECLINES We heavily market to and rely upon business from Reno area residents. In recent years, Reno has enjoyed robust business growth and has attracted a number of technology, product distribution and marketing companies. These businesses have created jobs and helped fuel residential development, including the southwest Reno metropolitan area near the Atlantis. Should there be negative changes in the business and job conditions in Reno, our Locals business, which is the most substantial part of our overall business, could be adversely impacted. OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY WEAKENED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST Because California and the Pacific Northwest are significant markets for our leisure traveler and conventioneer customers, our business may be adversely impacted in the event of weakened economic conditions in those geographical markets. EFFECTS OF CURRENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS The terrorist attacks that took place in the United States on September 11, 2001, were unprecedented events that created economic and business uncertainties, especially for the travel and tourism industry. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses, and other acts of war or hostility, including the ongoing conflict in Iraq, have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition in ways we cannot predict. AN OUTBREAK OF HIGHLY INFECTIOUS DISEASE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE NUMBER OF VISITORS TO OUR FACILITIES AND DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, RESULTING IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS There have been recent fears concerning the spread of an "avian flu" in Asia and worldwide. Potential future outbreaks of avian flu or other highly infectious diseases may adversely affect the number of visitors to our property and our business and prospects. Furthermore, an outbreak might disrupt our ability to adequately staff our business and could generally disrupt our operations. If any of our customers or employees is suspected of having contracted certain highly contagious diseases, we may be required to quarantine these customers or employees or the affected areas of our facilities and temporarily suspend part or all of our operations at affected facilities. Any new outbreak of such a highly infectious disease could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. -17- FAILURE OF THE RENO-SPARKS CONVENTION CENTER TO BOOK AND ATTRACT CONVENTION BUSINESS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS The Atlantis is the closest hotel-casino to the Reno-Sparks Convention Center. If the Reno-Sparks Convention Center does not succeed in booking the anticipated level of conventions, our future results of operations could be adversely impacted. BECAUSE WE ARE CURRENTLY DEPENDENT UPON A SINGLE PROPERTY IN A SINGLE MARKET FOR ALL OF OUR CASH FLOW, WE ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER RISKS THAN A GAMING COMPANY WITH MORE OPERATING PROPERTIES OR THAT OPERATES IN MORE MARKETS We currently do not have material assets or operations other than the Atlantis. As a result, we are entirely dependent upon this property for all of our cash flow until we develop other properties. OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY GAMING REGULATORY AUTHORITIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation. The State of Nevada and the applicable local authorities require various licenses, registrations, permits and approvals to be held by us and our subsidiary. The Nevada Gaming Commission may, among other things, limit, condition, suspend, revoke or decline to renew a license or approval to own the stock of our Nevada subsidiary for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority. If we violate gaming laws or regulations, substantial fines could be levied against us, our subsidiary and the persons involved, and we could be forced to forfeit a portion of our assets. The suspension, revocation or non-renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, findings of suitability, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our current gaming activities. However, gaming licenses and related approvals are deemed to be privileges under Nevada law. We cannot assure you that our existing licenses, permits and approvals will be maintained or extended. OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ALL POSSIBLE LOSSES THAT OUR PROPERTY COULD SUFFER. IN ADDITION, OUR INSURANCE COSTS MAY INCREASE AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE SAME INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE FUTURE. Although we have all-risk property insurance covering damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire and natural disasters), each such policy has certain exclusions. In addition, our property insurance is in an amount that may be less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the complex if there was a total loss. Our level of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, acts of war, loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage and pollution, might not be covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to heavy, uninsured losses. -18- In addition, although we currently have insurance coverage for occurrences of terrorist acts and for certain losses that could result from these acts, our terrorism coverage is subject to the same risks and deficiencies as those described above for our all-risk property coverage. The lack of sufficient insurance for these types of acts could expose us to heavy losses in the event that any damages occur, directly or indirectly, as a result of terrorist attacks or otherwise, which could have a significant negative impact on our operations. In addition to the damage caused to our property by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism), we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties injured or harmed. While we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in such event. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage. Among other factors, it is possible that the situation in Iraq, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits) and additional exclusions from coverage. Among other potential future adverse changes, in the future we may elect not to, or may not be able to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism. Our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows." IF THE STATE OF NEVADA OR THE CITY OF RENO INCREASES GAMING TAXES AND FEES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED State and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities. From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes. If the State of Nevada or the City of Reno were to increase gaming taxes and fees, our results of operations could be adversely affected. IF WE LOSE OUR KEY PERSONNEL, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED We depend on the continued performances of John Farahi, Bob Farahi and Ben Farahi, our Chief Executive Officer, our President, and our Chief Financial Officer, respectively, and their management team. If we lose the services of the Farahi brothers, or our other senior Atlantis management personnel, and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner, our business could be materially adversely affected. -19- ADVERSE WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE SIERRA NEVADAS AND RENO-LAKE TAHOE AREA COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Adverse winter weather conditions, particularly snowfall, can deter our customers from traveling or make it difficult for them to frequent the Atlantis. Adverse winter weather would most significantly affect our drive-in customers from northern California and the Pacific Northwest. If the Reno area itself were to experience prolonged adverse winter weather conditions, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. CLAIMS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST US AND OUR SUBSIDIARY IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL AND TAX CLAIMS ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME. It is possible that our cash flows and results of operations could be affected by the resolution of these claims. We believe that the ultimate disposition of current matters will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Please see the further discussion under "Legal Proceedings" in Item 3 of this Form 10-K. ENERGY PRICE INCREASES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF OPERATIONS AND OUR REVENUES. Our facility uses significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other forms of energy. While no shortages of energy or fuel have been experienced to date, substantial increases in energy and fuel prices in the United States have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect, our operating results. The extent of the impact is subject to the magnitude and duration of the energy and fuel price increases, but this impact could be material. In addition, energy and gasoline price increases in cities that constitute a significant source of customers for our properties could result in a decline in disposable income of potential customers and a corresponding decrease in visitation and spending at our properties, which would negatively impact revenues. CHANGES IN REGULATIONS ON LAND USE REQUIREMENTS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS A change in regulations on land use requirements with regard to development of new hotel casinos in the proximity of the Atlantis could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY HIGH-END PLAYERS' WINNINGS Although not the major focus of our marketing efforts, we have selectively targeted high-end players since opening our newest tower in 1999. Should one or more of these high-end players win large sums in our casino or should a material amount of credit extended to such players not be repaid, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. A CHANGE IN CONTROL COULD RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS Certain changes in control could result in the acceleration of the repayment of our bank debt. This acceleration could be triggered in the event -20- the Farahi family sells enough of their stock to result in another stockholder acquiring more than 50% of our shares or upon their deaths if their respective heirs must sell a substantial number of our shares to obtain funds to pay estate tax liabilities. We cannot assure you that we would be able to repay indebtedness whose maturity is accelerated as a result of such a change in control, and such an inability would materially adversely affect our financial condition.
