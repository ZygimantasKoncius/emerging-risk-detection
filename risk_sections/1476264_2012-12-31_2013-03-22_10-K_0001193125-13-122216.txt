Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Associated With WashingtonFirsts Business Combining WashingtonFirst and Alliance may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected. On December 21, 2012, WashingtonFirst consummated a merger with Alliance. Until the closing, WashingtonFirst and Alliance operated independently. Subsequent to the closing, WashingtonFirst has initiated the process of integrating the two businesses. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, disruption of the ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect WashingtonFirsts ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. As with any merger of banking institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause WashingtonFirst to lose customers or cause customers to move their deposits. WashingtonFirst will incur substantial expenses in integrating the two businesses. Although WashingtonFirst believes that the elimination of duplicate costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses of WashingtonFirst and Alliance will offset incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. The success of WashingtonFirst following the merger is dependent in large part on WashingtonFirsts ability to integrate the two businesses, business models and cultures. If WashingtonFirst is not able to integrate the operations of Washington First and Alliance successfully and timely, the expected benefits of the merger may not be realized. WashingtonFirst may fail to realize the cost savings estimated for the merger. Although WashingtonFirst believes that it will realize cost savings from the merger when integration is complete, it is possible that the amount of cost savings could be less than anticipated. For example, the combined purchasing power of WashingtonFirst and Alliance may not be as strong as expected, and therefore the cost savings could be less than expected. In addition, future business developments may require WashingtonFirst to continue to operate or maintain some facilities or support functions that are currently expected to be combined or reduced. The cost savings estimates also depend on WashingtonFirsts ability to combine the businesses of WashingtonFirst and Alliance in a manner that permits those costs savings to be realized. If WashingtonFirst is not able to combine the two companies successfully, the anticipated cost savings may not be fully realized or realized at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Results of operation after the merger may differ materially from the results of operation anticipated at the time of the merger. The results of operations of WashingtonFirst after the merger with Alliance may be materially different from those anticipated at the time of the merger. The actual costs of the merger and the integration of the companies could exceed amounts anticipated at the time of the merger. In addition, these charges may decrease capital of the combined company that could be used for profitable, income earning investments in the future. 16 Table of Contents The integration of the Alliance business may divert the attention of management of WashingtonFirst from its other responsibilities. The need to integrate the businesses of Alliance and WashingtonFirst will cause the management of WashingtonFirst to focus a portion of its time and energies on such matters that otherwise would be directed to the business and operations of WashingtonFirst. Any such diversion of managements attention, if significant, could affect WashingtonFirsts ability to service existing business and to develop new business and could adversely affect the business and earnings of WashingtonFirst. WashingtonFirst may not be able to manage future growth and competition in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The merger with Alliance will result in a significant acceleration of WashingtonFirsts expansion in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, where it previously operated ten branches. There can be no assurance that WashingtonFirst will be able to successfully manage the additional branches obtained in the Alliance merger and maintain profitable growth. WashingtonFirst has grown rapidly in the past several years, through acquisition and through organic growth. WashingtonFirst can provide no assurance that it will continue to be able to maintain its rate of growth at acceptable risk levels and upon acceptable terms, while managing the costs and implementation risks associated with its growth strategy. WashingtonFirst may be unable to continue to increase its volume of loans and deposits or to introduce new products and services at acceptable risk levels for a variety of reasons, including an inability to maintain capital and liquidity sufficient to support continued growth. If WashingtonFirst is successful in continuing its growth, it cannot assure you that further growth would offer the same levels of potential profitability, or that it would be successful in controlling costs and maintaining asset quality. WashingtonFirsts future success will depend on its ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial services industry. WashingtonFirst faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations from a variety of different competitors. In particular, there is very strong competition for financial services in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in which it conducts its business. WashingtonFirst competes with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as other local and community, superregional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices in its primary market areas and elsewhere. WashingtonFirsts future growth and success will depend on its ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive financial services environment. Many of WashingtonFirsts competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions and many offer products and services that it does not. Many have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. While WashingtonFirst believes it competes effectively with these other financial institutions in its primary markets, it may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of its smaller size, smaller asset base, lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread its marketing costs across a broader market. If WashingtonFirst has to raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on loans to compete effectively, its net interest margin and income could be negatively affected. Failure to compete effectively to attract new or to retain existing, clients may reduce or limit WashingtonFirsts net income and its market share and may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and growth. WashingtonFirsts profitability depends on interest rates generally, and it may be adversely affected by changes in government monetary policy. The economy, interest rates, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and regulatory policies have a significant influence on WashingtonFirst and the industry as a whole. WashingtonFirsts profitability depends in substantial part on its net interest margin, which is the difference between the rates it receives on loans and investments and the rates it pays for deposits and other sources of funds. Its net interest margin depends on many factors that are partly or completely outside of its control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies, and economic conditions generally. Its net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change so that the interest it pays on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest it earns on loans and investments. Changes in interest rates, particularly by the Federal Reserve, which implements national monetary policy in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures, also affect the value of its loans. In setting its policy, the Federal Reserve may utilize techniques such as: (i) engaging in open market transactions in United States government securities; (ii) setting the discount rate on member bank borrowings; and (iii) changing reserve requirements. These techniques may have an adverse effect on WashingtonFirsts deposit levels, net interest margin, loan demand or its business and operations. In addition, an increase in interest rates could adversely affect borrowers ability to pay the principal or interest on existing variable rate loans or reduce their desire to borrow more money. This may lead to an increase in WashingtonFirsts nonperforming assets, a decrease in loan originations, or a reduction in the value of and income from its loans, any of which could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirsts results of operations. WashingtonFirst tries to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk, but it is unable to completely eliminate this risk. Fluctuations in market rates and other market disruptions are neither predictable nor controllable and may have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirsts business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 Table of Contents WashingtonFirsts profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions, and may be adversely affected by reductions in Federal spending. WashingtonFirsts success is dependent to a significant extent upon general economic conditions in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area which are, in turn, dependent to a large extent on the Federal government, particularly its local employment and spending levels. In addition, the banking industry in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, similar to other geographic markets, is affected by general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment and other factors beyond WashingtonFirsts control. The adverse economic and financial conditions prevailing in the United States and in WashingtonFirsts market area since 2008 increased the number of loan defaults and foreclosures and resulted in a decline in credit quality, which negatively impacted WashingtonFirsts financial results. Prolonged continuation of these conditions or other economic dislocation in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, including a substantial reduction in the level of employment or local spending by the Federal government, could cause increases in nonperforming assets, thereby causing operating losses, impairing liquidity and eroding capital. For example, the reductions in Federal spending caused by the sequestration of funds, or sequester, on March 1, 2013 as the result of the failure of the Obama Administration and the Congress to reach agreement on changes in fiscal policy may reduce employment in the Greater Washington D.C. metropolitan area and adversely affect WashingtonFirst. WashingtonFirst cannot assure you that future adverse changes in the economy in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area would not have a material adverse effect on the WashingtonFirsts financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. WashingtonFirsts loan portfolios have significant real estate concentration. A substantial portion of WashingtonFirsts loan portfolio is secured by real estate collateral. At December 31, 2012, approximately 79 percent of WashingtonFirsts loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower. In the event of a general decline in the value of real estate assets, the value of WashingtonFirsts real estate collateral also may deteriorate. If WashingtonFirst is required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, WashingtonFirsts earnings and capital could be adversely affected. WashingtonFirsts business strategy includes the continuation of its growth plans, and its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if it fails to grow or fails to manage its growth effectively. In addition to the Alliance acquisition, WashingtonFirst intends to continue to grow in its existing banking markets (internally and through additional offices) and to expand into new markets as appropriate opportunities arise. WashingtonFirsts prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies that are experiencing growth. WashingtonFirst cannot assure you it will be able to expand its market presence in its existing markets or successfully enter new markets, or that any expansion will not adversely affect its results of operations. Failure to manage WashingtonFirsts growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on its business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations, and could adversely affect its ability to successfully implement its business strategy. Also, if WashingtonFirsts growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, its operating results could be materially affected in an adverse way. WashingtonFirsts ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in its market areas and its ability to manage its growth. While WashingtonFirst believes it has the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage its future growth, there can be no assurance growth opportunities will be available or growth will be successfully managed. WashingtonFirst may face risks with respect to future acquisitions. As a strategy, WashingtonFirst has sought to increase the size of the Bank by business acquisitions, and it has grown rapidly since its incorporation. WashingtonFirst may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those entities in the future. Acquisitions and mergers involve a number of risks, including:  the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners;  the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target entity may not be accurate;  the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced management opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and generating of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;  WashingtonFirsts ability to finance an acquisition and possible ownership or economic dilution to its current shareholders;  the diversion of WashingtonFirsts managements attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses; 18 Table of Contents  entry into new markets where WashingtonFirst lacks experience;  the introduction of new products and services into its business;  the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on WashingtonFirsts results of operations; and  the potential loss of key employees and clients. WashingtonFirst may incur substantial costs to expand, and it can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits it seeks. There can be no assurance that integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful. Also, WashingtonFirst may issue equity securities, including common stock and securities convertible into shares of its common stock, in connection with future acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to its current shareholders. There is no assurance that, following any future merger or acquisition, WashingtonFirsts integration efforts will be successful or that, after giving effect to the acquisition, it will achieve profits comparable to or better than its historical experience. WashingtonFirsts allowance for loan losses could become inadequate and reduce its earnings and capital. WashingtonFirst maintains an allowance for loan losses that it believes is adequate for absorbing the estimated future losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Management conducts a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses based upon general market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio and performance of WashingtonFirsts clients relative to their financial obligations with it. The amount of future losses, however, is susceptible to changes in economic and other market conditions, including changes in interest rates and collateral values, which are beyond WashingtonFirsts control, and these future losses may exceed its current estimates. There can be no assurance that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required in the future, including as a result of changes in the economic assumptions underlying managements estimates and judgments, adverse developments in the economy on a national basis or in the Banks market area, or changes in the circumstances of particular borrowers. Although WashingtonFirst believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in its loan portfolio, WashingtonFirst cannot predict the amount of such losses or guarantee that its allowance will be adequate in the future. Excessive loan losses could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst financial condition and results of operations. Liquidity needs could adversely affect WashingtonFirsts results of operations and financial condition. WashingtonFirsts primary source of funds is client deposits in the Bank and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters and international instability. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, regulatory capital requirements, returns available to clients on alternative investments and general economic conditions. The deposits from the title and escrow agency customers that WashingtonFirst acquired in the Alliance acquisition are expected to continue to be an important component of WashingtonFirsts deposit base. Because deposits of title and escrow agency customers are directly related to home sales and refinancing activity, any decrease in this activity would adversely impact WashingtonFirsts deposit levels. Accordingly, WashingtonFirst may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include Federal Home Loan Bank, or FHLB advances, sales of securities and loans, and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks, as well as out-of-market time deposits. While WashingtonFirst believes that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands, particularly if WashingtonFirst continues to grow and experience increasing loan demand. Should such sources not be adequate, WashingtonFirst may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth, capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets. WashingtonFirst is subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict its activities and adversely affect its earnings. WashingtonFirst and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not WashingtonFirsts shareholders. These regulations affect WashingtonFirsts lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on WashingtonFirst, the Bank and their respective operations. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector. Additional legislation and regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could significantly affect WashingtonFirsts powers, authority and operations, or the powers, authority and operations of the Bank in substantial and 19 Table of Contents unpredictable ways. Further, regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on WashingtonFirst. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the WashingtonFirsts business, financial condition and results of operations. The recent repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on commercial demand deposits could increase interest expense. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the prohibition on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on commercial demand deposit accounts was repealed. As a result, beginning on July 21, 2011, financial institutions could commence offering interest on commercial demand deposits. WashingtonFirst does not yet know how this change will impact its business. If competitive factors require WashingtonFirst to offer interest on demand deposit accounts or if historical low interest rates begin to rise, WashingtonFirsts interest expense may increase and the net interest margin may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirsts and the Banks business, financial condition and results of operations. WashingtonFirsts recent results may not be indicative of its future results. WashingtonFirst may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth or may not even be able to grow its business at all. In addition, its recent and rapid growth may distort some of its historical financial ratios and statistics. In the future, WashingtonFirst may not have the benefit of several recently favorable factors, such as a generally stable interest rate environment, an improving real estate market, the ability to find suitable expansion opportunities, or the relative resistance of the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to economic downturns. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede or prohibit WashingtonFirsts ability to expand its market presence. If WashingtonFirst experiences a significant decrease in its historical rate of growth, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to a high percentage of WashingtonFirsts operating costs being fixed expenses. WashingtonFirsts small to medium-sized business target market may have fewer financial resources to weather a downturn in the economy. WashingtonFirst targets its commercial development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small and medium-sized businesses. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact this economic sector in the markets in which WashingtonFirst operates, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. WashingtonFirst depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties. In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, WashingtonFirst may rely on information furnished to it by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. WashingtonFirst also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, WashingtonFirst may assume that a customers audited financial statements conform to GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. WashingtonFirsts financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent it relies on financial statements or other information that do not comply with GAAP or which are materially misleading. Negative public opinion could damage WashingtonFirsts reputation and adversely impact its earnings. Reputation risk, or the risk to its business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in WashingtonFirsts business. Negative public opinion can result from WashingtonFirsts actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect WashingtonFirsts ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose WashingtonFirst to litigation and regulatory action. Although WashingtonFirst takes steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with its clients and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of its business. WashingtonFirst depends on the services of key personnel, and a loss of any of those personnel could disrupt its operations and result in reduced revenues. WashingtonFirsts success depends upon the continued service of its senior management team and upon its ability to attract and retain qualified financial services personnel. Competition for qualified employees is intense. In managements experience, it can take a 20 Table of Contents significant period of time to identify and hire personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required in carrying out WashingtonFirsts strategy. If WashingtonFirst loses the services of its key personnel, including key client relationship personnel, or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel, its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. WashingtonFirst depends on technology to compete effectively and may be required to make substantial investments in new technology, which could have a negative effect on WashingtonFirsts operating results and the value of its common stock. The market for financial services, including banking services, is increasingly affected by advances in technology, including developments in telecommunications, data processing, computers, automation and Internet-based banking. This is particularly true for WashingtonFirst, which relies on technology to compete in its market. WashingtonFirst depends on third party vendors for portions of its data processing services. In addition to WashingtonFirsts ability to finance the purchase of those services and integrate them into its operations, its ability to offer new technology-based services depends on WashingtonFirsts vendors abilities to provide and support those services. Future advances in technology may require WashingtonFirst to incur substantial expenses that adversely affect its operating results, and WashingtonFirsts limited capital resources may make it impractical or impossible for it to keep pace with competitors possessing greater capital resources. WashingtonFirsts ability to compete successfully in its banking markets may depend on the extent to which WashingtonFirst and its vendors are able to offer new technology-based services and on WashingtonFirsts ability to integrate technological advances into its operations. WashingtonFirsts reliance on technology exposes WashingtonFirst to cybersecurity risks. WashingtonFirst relies on digital technologies to conduct its operations, and those technologies may be compromised by the deliberate attacks by others or unintentional cybersecurity incidents. Deliberate cybersecurity attacks may seek to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. Other events my not seek unauthorized access, but may seek to prevent authorized users to be able to access digital systems, referred to as a denial of service attacks. If WashingtonFirst were to suffer a cybersecurity incident of these types, it may could be required to incur substantial remediation and increased cybersecurity protection costs, such as implementing new technologies, hiring and training new employees and engaging third party experts and consultants. In addition, WashingtonFirst could become subject to litigation from customers whose sensitive data was obtained without their consent, and to damage to the companys reputation, which could have an adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operation. The dividend rate being paid on WashingtonFirsts Series D Preferred Stock is subject to increase. In August 2011, WashingtonFirst elected to participate in the SBLF, and issued 17,796 shares of its Series D Preferred Stock to the United States Treasury for $17.8 million. WashingtonFirst used a portion of the proceeds to repurchase the three series of preferred stock previously issued to the Treasury in the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, netting WashingtonFirst $3.8 million in new capital. The shares of Series D Preferred Stock currently pay dividends at a rate of one percent per annum, but the rate can fluctuate on a quarterly basis during the first ten quarters during which the Series D Preferred Stock is outstanding, based upon changes in the amount of WashingtonFirsts qualified small business lending, or QSBL, as defined in the Supplemental Reports related to the SBLF transaction, from a baseline level or QSBL Baseline. For the second dividend period through the tenth dividend period, the annual dividend rate may be adjusted to between 1.0 percent and 5.0 percent, to reflect the amount of percentage change in the Banks level of QSBL from the QSBL Baseline to the level as of the end of the second quarter preceding the dividend period in question. For the eleventh dividend period through 4.5 years after the closing of the SBLF transaction, the annual dividend rate will be fixed at between 1.0 percent and 5.0 percent, based upon the percentage increase in QSBL from the QSBL Baseline to the level as of the end of the ninth dividend period (i.e., as of September 30, 2013); however, if there is no increase in QSBL from the QSBL Baseline to the level as of the end of the ninth dividend period (or if QSBL has decreased during that time period), the dividend rate will be fixed at 7.0 percent. Further, the potential dividend rate reduction in any period is limited, such that the reduction will not apply to any Series D Preferred Stock proceeds that exceed the dollar amount of the increase in QSBL for that period as compared to the QSBL Baseline. In addition, if the Banks QSBL is not above the QSBL Baseline at the end of the ninth dividend period, because of the Banks participation in the U.S. Treasurys Capital Purchase Program, WashingtonFirst must also pay a lending incentive fee of 2.0 percent per annum (payable quarterly), calculated based on the liquidation value of the outstanding Series D Preferred Stock as of the end of that quarter, beginning with dividend payment dates on or after April 1, 2014 and ending on April 1, 2016. After 4.5 years from the closing of the SBLF transaction, the annual dividend rate will be fixed at 9.0 percent, regardless of the level of QSBL. Depending on WashingtonFirsts financial condition at the time, any such increases in the dividend rate could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirsts liquidity. The failure by the Bank to make payments of principal and interest on its outstanding subordinated capital notes may have negative consequences, including external involvement in the board of directors of the Bank or WashingtonFirst. On June 15, 2012, the Bank incurred $2.5 million in subordinated indebtedness, which bears interest at a rate of 8.0 percent per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. Principal is due and payable in full on June 14, 2021. The subordinated capital notes are as Tier 2 capital by bank regulatory authorities. The Bank may call the subordinated capital notes, without penalty, at any time after June 15, 2015. The notes are the subordinated unsecured obligations of the Bank and are not guaranteed by WashingtonFirst. For so long as the notes qualify as Tier 2 capital under applicable banking regulations, the notes will be subordinate to all deposits and general creditors of the Bank. In connection with the issuance of the subordinated capital notes, WashingtonFirst issued a warrant to purchase 55,018 shares of common stock to the lender, exercisable at $11.36 per share, subject to adjustment. If the Bank fails to make any payment due under the subordinated capital notes or the warrant for a period of 30 days, or the ratio of classified assets to Tier 1 capital of the Bank is 40 percent or greater, the holder of the notes is entitled (subject to any prior required regulatory approval) to appoint an observer to attend the meetings of the boards of directors of WashingtonFirst and the Bank and any 21 Table of Contents board committees. If WashingtonFirsts failure to pay such amounts extends for a period of 120 days, or the ratio of classified assets to Tier 1 capital of the Bank is 70 percent or greater, then subject to any prior regulatory approval the holder of the notes shall be entitled to appoint one representative of the holder to the board of directors of either WashingtonFirst or the Bank. Once appointed, such observer or representative shall remain on the board until the expiration of 12 months after payment of all amounts due, or the reduction of the ratio to less than 40 percent or 70 percent, as the case may be. Risks Associated with WashingtonFirsts Common Stock An active liquid trading market for WashingtonFirsts common stock may not develop and WashingtonFirsts stock price may be volatile. WashingtonFirsts common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or the NASDAQ, on December 24, 2012. However, an active and liquid trading market for WashingtonFirsts common stock may not develop or be maintained. Liquid and active trading markets usually result in less price volatility and more efficiency in carrying out investors purchase and sale orders. The market price of WashingtonFirsts common stock could vary significantly as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond WashingtonFirsts control. The following factors could affect WashingtonFirsts stock price:  WashingtonFirsts operating and financial performance;  quarterly variations in the rate of growth of WashingtonFirsts financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income and revenues;  strategic actions by WashingtonFirsts competitors;  changes in WashingtonFirsts revenue or earnings estimates;  publication of reports or changes or withdrawals of research coverage by equity research analysts;  speculation in the press or investment community;  sales of WashingtonFirsts common stock by WashingtonFirst, members of its board of directors or management, or the perception that such sales may occur;  changes in accounting principles;  additions or departures of key management personnel;  actions by WashingtonFirsts shareholders;  general market conditions, including fluctuations in interest rates; and  domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to WashingtonFirsts performance. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of WashingtonFirsts common stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a companys securities. Such litigation, if instituted against WashingtonFirst, could result in very substantial costs, divert WashingtonFirsts managements attention and resources and harm WashingtonFirsts business, operating results and financial condition. Because WashingtonFirst is a relatively small company, the requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain its resources, increase its costs and distract management; and WashingtonFirst may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner. As a new public company with listed equity securities, WashingtonFirst is required to comply with certain laws, regulations and requirements, including corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of the NASDAQ, with which WashingtonFirst was not required to comply as a private company until very recently. WashingtonFirst is required to:  design, establish, evaluate and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;  design, establish, evaluate and maintain a systems of disclosure controls and procedures to ensure the information required to be disclosed in its filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner;  comply with rules promulgated by the NASDAQ;  prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with WashingtonFirsts obligations under the federal securities laws;  establish new internal policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading; 22 Table of Contents  involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities; and  enhance its investor relations function. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements occupy a significant amount of time of WashingtonFirsts board of directors and management and significantly increase its costs and expenses. WashingtonFirst assumed approximately $10.0 million in trust capital notes issued by an Alliance subsidiary on which the payment of an aggregate of $1.4 million in interest has been deferred as permitted by the indenture. Until these arrearages are paid, WashingtonFirst may not pay any dividends on any of its capital stock, including the SBLF preferred stock. In June 2003, Alliance issued $10.0 million in trust preferred securities through a wholly-owned statutory business trust. The trust preferred securities accrue interest at a rate of three month LIBOR plus 315 basis points, subject to quarterly interest rate adjustments, which was equivalent to 3.628 percent as of December 31, 2012. WashingtonFirst assumed these obligations in connection with the Alliance merger and recorded a liability of $7.5 million based on fair value accounting principles. As of December 31, 2012 $10.3 million was considered Tier 1 regulatory capital. The indenture governing the trust preferred securities permits the deferral of interest payments for up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods. Commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2009 and continuing through December 31, 2012, Alliance, and then WashingtonFirst after assumption of the obligation, elected to defer the interest payments otherwise due. The interest deferred under the indenture compounds quarterly at the interest rate then in effect. As of December 31, 2012, the total amount of deferred and compounded interest owed under the indenture was approximately $1.5 million. The arrearages were paid in full by WashingtonFirst on March 8, 2013. WashingtonFirsts articles of incorporation and bylaws and Virginia law contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of WashingtonFirsts common stock. WashingtonFirsts articles of incorporation authorize its board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. If WashingtonFirsts board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire WashingtonFirst. In addition, some provisions of WashingtonFirsts articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of WashingtonFirst, even if the change of control would be beneficial to and desirable by WashingtonFirsts shareholders, including:  a staggered board of directors;  the ability of the WashingtonFirst board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval, which preferred stock could have voting, liquidation, dividend or other rights superior to those of the WashingtonFirst common stock;  the inability of WashingtonFirst shareholders to act without a meeting except by unanimous written consent;  the inability of WashingtonFirst shareholders to call special meetings;  limitations on affiliated transactions and control share acquisitions;  if a two-thirds majority of the WashingtonFirst board of directors has not approved certain transactions, such as an amendment to the WashingtonFirst articles of incorporation, merger, share exchange, sale of substantially all of the assets, or dissolution, the transaction must receive the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of each voting group of WashingtonFirst shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction for the transaction to be approved; and  the WashingtonFirst bylaws provide that the WashingtonFirst bylaws may be amended by the WashingtonFirst board of directors. The VSCA contains provisions governing affiliated transactions. These include various transactions such as mergers, share exchanges, sales, leases, exchanges, mortgages, pledges, transfers or other material dispositions of assets, issuances of securities, dissolutions, and similar transactions with an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder is generally the beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of any class of a corporations outstanding voting shares. During the three years following the date a shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, any affiliated transaction with the interested shareholder must be approved by both a majority of the disinterested directors (those directors who were directors before the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder or who were recommended for election by a majority of disinterested directors) and by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the corporations voting shares other than shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder. These requirements do not apply to affiliated transactions if, among other things, a majority of the disinterested directors approve the interested shareholders acquisition of voting shares making such a person an interested shareholder before such acquisition. Beginning three years after the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the corporation may engage in an affiliated transaction with the interested shareholder if:  the transaction is approved by the holders of two-thirds of the corporations voting shares, other than shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder;  the affiliated transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested directors; or 23 Table of Contents  subject to certain additional requirements, in the affiliated transaction the holders of each class or series of voting shares will receive consideration meeting specified fair price and other requirements designed to ensure that all shareholders receive fair and equivalent consideration, regardless of when they tendered their shares. Under the VSCAs control share acquisitions law, voting rights of shares of stock of a Virginia corporation acquired by an acquiring person or other entity at ownership levels of 20 percent, 33 1/3 percent and 50 percent of the outstanding shares may, under certain circumstances, be denied. The voting rights may be denied:  unless conferred by a special shareholder vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for directors, other than shares held by the acquiring person and officers and directors of the corporation; or  among other exceptions, such acquisition of shares is made pursuant to an affiliation agreement with the corporation or the corporations articles of incorporation or bylaws permit the acquisition of such shares before the acquiring persons acquisition thereof. If authorized in the corporations articles of incorporation or bylaws, the statute also permits the corporation to redeem the acquired shares at the average per share price paid for them if the voting rights are not approved or if the acquiring person does not file a control share acquisition statement with the corporation within 60 days of the last acquisition of such shares. If voting rights are approved for control shares comprising more than 50 percent of the corporations outstanding stock, objecting shareholders may have the right to have their shares repurchased by the corporation for fair value. These provisions are only applicable to public corporations that have more than 300 shareholders, and, therefore, have not historically been applicable to WashingtonFirst. Corporations may provide in their articles of incorporation or bylaws to opt-out of these provisions, but WashingtonFirst has not done so. Future sales of WashingtonFirsts common stock in the public market could lower its stock price, and any additional capital raised by WashingtonFirst through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute the ownership of existing shareholders. WashingtonFirst may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings or otherwise issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities in the future. WashingtonFirst intends to file a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of 956,749 shares of WashingtonFirsts common stock issued or reserved for issuance under the WashingtonFirst 2010 Equity Compensation Plan and predecessor WashingtonFirst incentive plans. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, shares registered under WashingtonFirsts registration statement on Form S-8 will be available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction. WashingtonFirst cannot predict the size of future issuances of its common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of its common stock will have on the market price of its common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of WashingtonFirsts common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of WashingtonFirsts common stock. The concentration of WashingtonFirsts capital stock ownership will limit your ability to influence corporate matters. WashingtonFirsts directors and executive officers as a group beneficially own approximately 25.3 percent of WashingtonFirsts outstanding common stock and options exercisable within sixty days. Consequently, WashingtonFirsts board of directors has significant influence over all matters that require approval by WashingtonFirsts shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate matters. WashingtonFirsts ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions, and it may be unable to pay future dividends. WashingtonFirsts ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory, statutory and contractual restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient capital. Its only source of funds with which to pay dividends to its shareholders are dividends received from the Bank, and the Banks ability to pay dividends is limited by its own obligations to maintain sufficient capital and regulatory restrictions. If these regulatory requirements are not satisfied, WashingtonFirst will be unable to pay dividends on its common stock. WashingtonFirst has not paid common dividends in its history, and does not have plans to pay dividends to its common shareholders in the foreseeable future. Future dividend payments and common stock repurchases are subject to certain restrictions by the terms of the Secretary of the Treasurys equity investment in WashingtonFirst. Under the terms of the SBLF, for so long as any preferred stock issued under the SBLF remains outstanding, WashingtonFirst is prohibited from making a dividend payment or share repurchase if, after the payment or repurchase, its Tier 1 capital would not be at 24 Table of Contents least 90 percent of the amount existing at the time immediately after August 4, 2011, excluding any subsequent net charge-offs and partial repayments of the SBLF funding. This 90 percent limitation will decrease by a dollar amount equal to 10.0 percent of the SBLF funding for every 1.0 percent increase in QSBL that WashingtonFirst has achieved over the QSBL Baseline. These restrictions will no longer apply to WashingtonFirst after it has repaid the SBLF funding in full. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None 25 Table of Contents
