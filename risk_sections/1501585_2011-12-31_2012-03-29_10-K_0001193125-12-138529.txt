ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. We seek to identify, manage, and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. You should consider the following factors carefully, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase our securities. Risks Related to Our Business We depend heavily on a single customer, the U.S. Government, for substantially all of our business, and changes affecting this customers ability to do business with us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our business is primarily dependent upon the design, construction, repair, maintenance, fleet support and life cycle services of nuclear-powered ships, such as aircraft carriers and submarines, and non-nuclear ships, such as surface combatants and expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships for the U.S. Navy and coastal defense surface ships for the U.S. Coast Guard, as well as the overhaul and refueling of nuclear-powered ships for the U.S. Navy. Substantially all of our revenues during 2011 were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the U.S. Government, and we expect this to continue in the future. In addition, substantially all of our backlog was U.S. Government related as of December 31, 2011. We are a supplier, either directly or as a subcontractor or team member, to the U.S. Government and its agencies. The related contracts are subject to various risks, including our customers political and budgetary constraints and processes, changes in customers short-range and long-range strategic plans, the timing of contract awards, significant changes in contract scheduling, intense contract and funding competition, difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work, delays in the timing of contract approval, and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal or regulatory requirements. Any of these factors could affect our ability to do business with the U.S. Government, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to uncertain levels of funding, modification due to changes in customer priorities and potential termination. We are directly dependent upon congressional allocation of defense monies to the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard. The funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. For certain programs, Congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be performed over several fiscal years. Consequently, programs may be partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the fiscal year 2013 budget and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by Congress or will be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations. The impact, severity and duration of the current U.S. economic downturn and pressures on the federal budget could also adversely affect the total funding and/or funding for individual programs. The level of future appropriations for defense programs has become more uncertain, following the debt ceiling crisis in August 2011 and the failure of a joint committee of Congress to identify up to $1.5 trillion in deficit reductions in November 2011, as required under the Budget Control Act of 2011. As a result of such failure, up to $600 billion in automatic spending cuts to defense programs could be triggered under the Budget Control Act beginning in 2013, or cuts could be effected through other congressional actions, which could result in the cancellation of or decreased funding for our existing programs and/or a lack of funding for future programs. The Budget Control Act provided for $487 billion of defense cuts over the next decade, and the $600 billion of sequestration cuts would be added to that amount. In the event that appropriations for any of our existing or future programs become unavailable, or are reduced or delayed, our contracts or subcontracts under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the U.S. Government, which could have a material adverse effect on our future sales under such programs, and on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and/or the nature of war related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A shift of government priorities to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 11 Table of Contents In addition, the U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, with little to no prior notice, for convenience or for default based on performance. In the event of termination for the U.S. Governments convenience, contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit related to those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. However, such a termination could result in the cancelation of future work on that program. Termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities, including excess reprocurement costs, and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for contracts. Any termination can also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Contract cost growth on fixed price and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and to the potential loss of future business. Our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers. This cost growth can occur if estimates to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges, manufacturing difficulties, delays, workforce related issues, or if initial estimates used for calculating the contract cost were inaccurate. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the timelines and availability of materials, major subcontractor performance and quality of their products, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters and the inability to recover claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our ability to recover the costs we incur and realize profits on contracts with our U.S. Government customer depends on the type of contract under which we are performing. Our U.S. Government business is currently performed under firm fixed price (FFP), fixed price incentive (FPI), cost plus incentive fee (CPIF), cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) and cost plus award fee (CPAF) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we retain all costs savings on completed contracts but are liable for the full amount of all expenditures in excess of the contract price. FPI contracts, on the other hand, are flexibly priced arrangements under which overruns and underruns to an agreed target cost are shared between the U.S. Government and us. The U.S. Government is liable for its share of allowable costs up to a ceiling price, and we are responsible for all costs incurred in excess of such ceiling price, typically 125135% of target cost. Our profit varies according to a formula set forth in the contract that generally compares the amount of costs incurred to the contract target cost. Under CPIF, CPFF and CPAF contracts, we are generally only required to perform the contract to the extent the U.S. Government makes funds available, and we recover all allowable costs incurred in the performance of the contract. Under CPIF contracts, our profit is determined by a contractually specified formula that compares allowable incurred costs to the contract target cost, subject in some instances to a maximum or minimum fee percentage. Under CPFF contracts, the dollar amount of profit received is the same without regard to the amount of costs incurred. Under CPAF contracts, the dollar amount of profit received is determined by the award fee provisions in the contract. In 2011, approximately 45% of Newport News revenues were CPIF, which primarily included aircraft carrier construction and RCOH. Approximately 27% of Newport News 2011 revenues were FPI contracts, consisting primarily of submarine construction, 26% of revenues were CPFF contracts, 1% were CPAF and 1% were FFP. Approximately 73% of Ingalls revenues were FPI, 13% were CPAF, 9% were CPFF, 3% were CPIF and 2% were FFP. To the extent our mix of contract types change in the future, our ability to recover our costs and realize profits on our contracts can be negatively affected. Our earnings and margins depend, in part, on our ability to perform under contracts, subcontractor performance and raw materials and component availability and pricing. When agreeing to contract terms, we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events, many of which extend over long periods. These projections assess the productivity and availability of labor, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries. We may experience significant variances from our assumptions, delays in our contract performance and variances in the timing of our product deliveries. If actual events differ significantly from one or more of our assumptions, projections or estimates, or if we face unanticipated contract costs, the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected. We rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major components for our products, and we rely on subcontractors to produce hardware elements and sub-assemblies and perform certain services that we provide to our customers. Disruptions or performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our 12 Table of Contents commitments to customers. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreed-upon products or materials or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. All major materials, parts and components for our products are currently available in adequate supply from domestic and/or foreign sources. Through the cost escalation provisions contained in some of our U.S. Government contracts, we may be protected from increases in material costs to the extent that the increases in our costs are in line with industry indices. Even with these provisions, however, the difference in basis between our actual material costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty. A significant delay in deliveries of key raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In connection with our government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the U.S. Government. Due largely to the consolidation of the defense industry, there are currently certain components for which there is only one supplier. The inability of a sole source supplier to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts. The prospects of U.S. shipyards, including ours, can be materially affected by their success in securing significant U.S. Navy contract awards. In February 2010, the DoD issued its Report of the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), a legislatively mandated review of military strategy and priorities that shapes defense funding over the ensuing four years. The U.S. Navy relied on the force requirements set forth in the QDR to design its 2012 Shipbuilding Plan, which applied the goals and strategies set forth in the QDR to identify the naval capabilities projected to meet the defense challenges faced by the United States in the next three decades. The 2012 Shipbuilding Plan uses, as a baseline, a 328-ship force, up from the former 313-ship force that was first proposed by the U.S. Navy to Congress in 2006. Of the 328-ship force, the 2012 Shipbuilding Plan currently anticipates procurement of 275 ships during the next 30 years. In response to the plan to cut $487 billion of defense spending over the next decade, as provided in the Budget Control Act of 2011, the DoD released in January 2012 a revised comprehensive military strategy that seeks to address the reduced funding. The U.S. Navy has indicated it will complete a new force structure assessment by the end of 2012 that will address the number of ships and other weapons the U.S. Navy believes it will need in light of the new national security strategy. Any significant reduction from the 2012 Shipbuilding Plan and a resulting reduction in the number of ships procured by the U.S. Navy would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We believe that our shipbuilding programs are a high priority for national defense, but, under budgetary pressures, one or more of our programs may be reduced, extended or terminated by our U.S. Government customers. Specific actions already taken that could negatively affect us include the deferral of production of new maritime prepositioning ships, the reduction in the number of planned large surface combatants and an increase in the procurement interval for aircraft carriers to five years. In response to the need for cheaper alternatives and the proliferation of smart weapons, it is possible that future strategy reassessments by the DoD may result in a decreased need for aircraft carriers. For the year ended December 31, 2011, aircraft carrier construction and design engineering accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated revenue. Significant reductions in the level of Congressional appropriations for our shipbuilding programs or significant delays of such appropriations would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Department of Defense has announced plans for significant changes to its business practices that could have a material effect on its overall procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards. In November 2010, the DoD announced certain initiatives designed to gain efficiencies, refocus priorities and enhance business practices used by the DoD, including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors. These initiatives are organized in five major areas: Affordability and Cost Growth; Productivity and Innovation; Competition; Services Acquisition; and Processes and Bureaucracy. Our understanding is that these initiatives are intended to drive down costs and enhance efficiencies and productivity. As described by a senior DoD official, they are intended to enable the DoD to do more without more. These initiatives are expected to impact the contracting environment in which we do business with our DoD customers as we and others in the industry adjust our practices to address the new initiatives and the reduced level of spending by the DoD. We are taking steps internally to assess how we can respond to and support these changes, including how we can further 13 Table of Contents reduce costs and increase productivity, modify how we respond to proposals and revise our areas of focus. Depending on how these initiatives are implemented, they could have an impact on current programs, as well as new business opportunities. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost, requiring us to have and maintain technologies, facilities, equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers. Shipbuilding is a long cycle business, and our success depends on quality, cost and schedule performance on our contracts. We must have and sustain the people, technologies, facilities, equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost. If we fail to maintain our competitive position, we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain market share and our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of engineers and skilled workers, at competitive costs, with requisite skills and/or security clearances. At the same time, stable future revenues and costs are important for us to maintain a qualified workforce. The necessary nuclear expertise required and the challenges of hiring and training a qualified workforce can be a limitation on our business. If qualified personnel become scarce, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees or difficulty in performing under our contracts or pursuing new business if the needs for such employees are unmet. Competition within our markets and an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share. We believe the programs and number of ship constructions, refuelings and overhauls and inactivations currently planned by the U.S. Navy over the next several years will remain relatively steady; however, projected U.S. defense spending levels for periods beyond the near-term are uncertain and difficult to predict. While the U.S. Navys current 2012 Shipbuilding Plan is based on an optimized 328-ship force, the plan itself anticipates procurement of only 275 ships during the 30-year period. Moreover, the 275 ship force is currently under reassessment and may be reduced. Reductions in U.S. defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our risk exposure to market competition. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, we may experience declines in revenues and market share, which would negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Although we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclear-powered carriers, we believe that two existing government-owned shipyards, one in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and the other in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic, could refuel nuclear-powered carriers if substantial investments in facilities, personnel and training were made. U.S. Government-owned shipyards are presently involved in refueling, overhaul and inactivation of SSN-688 Los Angeles-class submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling non-nuclear ships. The 2012 Act requires DoD to develop a core depot level maintenance capability to refuel nuclear aircraft carriers. The 2012 Act, however, permits the Secretary of Defense to waive the requirement for DoD to develop a refueling capability, if fulfilling the requirement would not be economically feasible. If the Secretary does not grant a waiver and a government-owned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the business of refueling nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We also compete in the engineering, planning and design market with other companies that provide engineering support services. There can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on future U.S. Navy engineering work, including aircraft carrier research and development, submarine design and future surface combatant, and amphibious assault programs. The competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. As the competitive environment intensifies, the number of bid protests may increase. Bid protests could result in an award decision being overturned, requiring a re-bid of the contract. Even when a bid protest does not result in a re-bid, the resolution typically extends the time until the contract activity can begin, which may reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise have commenced. Overcapacity in the U.S. shipbuilding market may reduce our market share or our ability to secure contract awards at profitable prices. The reduced level of shipbuilding activity by the U.S. Navy, evidenced by the reduction in fleet size from 566 ships in 1989 to 285 ships as of June 10, 2011, has resulted in workforce reductions in the industry but little infrastructure consolidation. 14 Table of Contents The general result has been fewer contracts awarded to the same fixed number of shipyards. There are principally six major private U.S. shipyards, three of which are our shipyards, plus numerous other smaller private shipyards that compete for contracts to construct, overhaul, repair or convert naval vessels. We have announced our intention to cease all shipbuilding operations in our Louisiana facilities and anticipate complete closure of these facilities by the end of 2013. Competition for future programs is expected to be intense. Additionally, our products, such as aircraft carriers, submarines and other ships, compete with each other as well as with other defense products and services for defense monies. We cannot guarantee that there will not be some future rationalization of shipyard capacity in the United States and that we will not be subject to shipyard consolidation or closures as a result of the reduced level of U.S. Navy spending on the construction of its naval fleet. Any further reduction could have a significant effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to substantial regulations and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a U.S. Government audit or investigation. U.S. Government contractors must comply with a variety of significant regulations, including procurement, nuclear and other requirements. These regulations and requirements, although customary in government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. Our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment, which mandates increased performance and compliance efforts and costs. If any such regulations or requirements change, our costs of complying with them could increase and reduce our margins. We operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. Government and its various agencies, such as the U.S. Navys Supervisor of Shipbuilding, the DCAA and the DCMA. These agencies review our performance under our contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies. Systems that are subject to review include, but are not limited to, our accounting systems, purchasing systems, billing systems, property management and control systems, cost estimating systems, compensation systems and management information systems. Any costs we incur that are found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if previously reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension, or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. We could also suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the U.S. Government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. As contracts subject to new contractor business systems rules are awarded, withholdings may occur in the future if the U.S. Government makes a final determination of one or more significant deficiencies in one or more such systems. As with other government contractors, the U.S. Government has, from time to time, recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced, or that costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed. Some of these recommendations involve substantial amounts. In the past, as a result of such audits and other investigations and inquiries, we have on occasion made minor adjustments to our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts. We cannot guarantee that such audits, investigations and inquiries will not result in reductions of our contract prices in the future. We are also, from time to time, subject to U.S. Government investigations relating to our operations, and we are subject to or are expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws, including, but not limited to, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the False Claims Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, Cost Accounting Standards, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If we are convicted or otherwise found to have violated the law, or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law, we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, compensatory or treble damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Such findings or convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracting. Given our dependence on government contracting, suspension or debarment would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 15 Table of Contents Many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, require manufacturing expertise or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control, and failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects. We design, develop and manufacture products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments. Problems and delays in development or delivery of subcontractor components or services as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements. First-in-class ships, also known as lead ships, usually have new technology that is supplied by the U.S. Navy, other contractors, or us. Problems in developing these new technologies or design changes later in the construction process can lead to delays in maintaining the design schedule needed for construction. The risk associated with new technology or mid-construction design changes can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery. For example, the new CVN-78 Gerald R. Ford-class has many new technologies, with several of them still in development. Those technologies include, but are not limited to, the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) and the Dual Band Radar (DBR). All three of these technologies are being developed concurrently with the ship under construction. Late delivery of information could drive inefficiencies in the construction process, increase costs and put the delivery schedule at risk, which could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects. In addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems. Examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenues and profitability include premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement, problems with quality or workmanship and unplanned degradation of product performance. These failures could result, either directly or indirectly, in loss of life or property. Unforeseen problems that may negatively affect our revenues and profits by causing unanticipated costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer, diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems, loss of follow-on work and, in the case of certain contracts, repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received. In the past, we have experienced quality issues with respect to products and services that we sell to our U.S. Government customer. These issues have required significant resources to analyze the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions. We may discover additional quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action. Currently undiscovered quality issues that might arise in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts. We may not realize the anticipated benefits or may incur additional costs related to the wind down of our construction activities at our Louisiana facilities and the consolidation of all Ingalls construction into our Mississippi facilities. We have announced our intention to wind down our construction activities at Avondale, our Louisiana shipyard, in 2013 and two Louisiana components facilities by 2013, after completing LPD-23 and LPD-25, the two LPD-17 San Antonio-class ships currently under construction, and consolidate all Ingalls construction into our Mississippi facilities. We intend to shift future construction of LPD class ships to a single production line at our Pascagoula, Mississippi facility to reduce costs and increase efficiency. We cannot provide any assurances that consolidation of Ingalls shipbuilding activities at our Pascagoula and Gulfport facilities will result in our realization of benefits from serial production at those facilities. In connection with the increased utilization of our employees and facilities in our Pascagoula shipyard, we may encounter difficulties in adhering to back-to-back production schedules. An inability to adhere to production schedules could have an adverse effect on our ability to timely perform under our contracts and to obtain new contracts in the future. Furthermore, because our Ingalls workforce will be located primarily in Pascagoula and Gulfport, we may be unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled and trained employees to perform the increased workload in these two locations. Any failure to attract and retain the necessary workforce, or to effectively manage and control third-party contractors, could adversely affect our ability to perform under our contracts and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We anticipate that we will incur substantial restructuring related costs and asset write-downs, currently estimated at $271 million, related to the wind down of our operations at Avondale. We believe that substantially all of the restructuring expenses associated with the wind down of those operations will be recoverable and amortized as future allowable costs over five years based upon applicable government regulations governing internal restructuring activities and/or other FAR allowable contract cost provisions. In a preliminary assessment of our proposed treatment of the wind down costs, the 16 Table of Contents U.S. Navy voiced concerns regarding the allowability of selected elements of our restructuring proposal. The DCAA prepared an initial audit report on our cost recovery proposal, which stated that the proposal was not adequately supported for the DCAA to reach a conclusion and questioned approximately $25 million, or 8%, of the costs included in the proposal. We have submitted a revised proposal to address the concerns of the DCAA and to reflect an estimated total cost of $271 million. We currently do not have an agreement with the U.S. Navy regarding the government contract accounting and pricing treatment of the restructuring and shutdown costs associated with our wind down at Avondale. We may also incur environmental costs in connection with the wind down. These potential costs are not known and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but they could be significant. The actual restructuring expenses related to the wind down may be greater than our current estimate and any inability to recover such costs could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We use estimates when accounting for contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and our overall financial position. Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For new programs, we estimate, negotiate and contract for construction on ships that are not completely designed. As a result, assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues for these ships are subject to the variability of the final ship design and evolving scope of work. For all ships, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract, because costs include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of our efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenues and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. Because of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above, materially different amounts can be generated if different assumptions are used or if the underlying circumstances change. Future changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and our financial performance. See Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments in Item 7. Our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters, environmental disasters and other factors that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have significant operations located in regions of the United States that have been and may be exposed to damaging storms, such as hurricanes, and environmental disasters, such as oil spills. Although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant. Should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur, which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position. Our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract. Performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on the prime contract, which could reduce our profitability due to damages or other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the subcontractor, the customer or our insurers and could result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts. Natural disasters can also disrupt our workforce, electrical and other power distribution networks, including computer and internet operation and accessibility, and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations. These disruptions could cause adverse effects on our profitability and performance. Environmental disasters, particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water used for the transport and testing of our ships, can disrupt the timing of our performance under our contracts with the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard. 17 Table of Contents Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur, which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position. We endeavor to identify and obtain, in established markets, insurance agreements to cover significant risks and liabilities, including, among others, natural disasters, product liability and business interruption. Not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance, and, for insurable risks, the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred, including, for example, a catastrophic hurricane claim. In some, but not all, circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. Government. Because of the limitations in overall available insurance coverage, we may have to bear substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows, and, if litigation with the carrier becomes necessary, an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 50% of our approximately 38,000 employees are covered by a total of 10 collective bargaining agreements. We expect to renegotiate renewals of each of our collective bargaining agreements between 2013 and 2015 as they approach expiration. Collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation at that time. While we believe we maintain good relationships with our represented workers, it is possible that we may experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective bargaining agreements. We have, in the past, experienced work stoppages, strikes and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements. If we experience such events in the future, we could incur additional expenses and work stoppages or delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Significant changes in key estimates and assumptions, such as discount rates and assumed long-term return on assets, actual investment returns on our pension plan assets, and legislative and regulatory actions could affect our earnings, equity, and contributions to our pension and retiree health care plans in future periods. Our pension and retiree health care costs are dependent on significant judgment in the use of various assumptions, particularly with respect to the estimates of the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates. Variances from these estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Differences between actual investment returns and our expected long-term return on assets will result in changes in future pension expense and funded status, and could result in adverse changes in required funding to the plans. Timing differences exist among the accrual of pension costs under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), pension funding, and the recovery of costs that are allowable under our government contracts. Such timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations. On December 27, 2011, the U.S. Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) Board issued its final CAS Harmonization Rule (the Harmonization Rule). The new rule will impact pension costs on contracts beginning in 2013 and is effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after February 27, 2012. Although we believe that contractors are entitled to an equitable adjustment on CAS-covered contracts awarded prior to the February 27, 2012 effective date, the application of this rule could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows if we are unable to successfully recover such equitable adjustment. For a complete discussion regarding how our consolidated financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies and regulatory changes, see Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments in Item 7. Unforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to climate change concerns or other actions commonly referred to as green initiatives. We expect to incur capital and operating costs in the future to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations. The nature of shipbuilding operations requires the use of hazardous materials. Our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater, which we treat before discharging pursuant to various permits. In order to handle these materials, 18 Table of Contents our shipyards have an extensive network of aboveground and underground storage tanks, some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past. In addition, the extensive handling of these materials sometimes results in spills in the shipyards and occasionally in the adjacent rivers and waterways where we operate. The shipyards also have extensive waste handling programs that we maintain and periodically modify consistent with changes in applicable regulations. See Environmental, Health and Safety in Item 1. Various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation, storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes. Stringent fines and penalties may be imposed for noncompliance, and certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage, without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. Such laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties. Environmental laws and regulations can also impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with current federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. In addition, if we are found to be in violation of the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the EPA on the Excluded Parties List maintained by the General Services Administration. Facilities on the Excluded Parties List are prohibited from working on any U.S. Government contract. The listing would continue until the EPA concludes that the cause of the violation had been cured. The adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, imposition of new cleanup requirements, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our ability to recover such costs under previously priced contracts or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We previously announced our intention to wind down our shipbuilding operations at our Louisiana facilities located in Avondale, Waggaman, and Tallulah, which we anticipate will be completed in 2013. The winding down of operations at these facilities may result in environmental costs. These potential costs are not known and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but they could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Market volatility and adverse capital or credit market conditions may affect our ability to access cost-effective sources of funding and expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and the ability of counterparties to perform on financial instruments. The financial and credit markets have experienced high levels of volatility and disruption, reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers. We expect to access these markets to support certain business activities, including acquisitions and capital expansion projects, obtaining credit support for our self-insurance for workers compensation, refinancing existing debt and issuing letters of credit. Depending on the condition of the capital or credit markets existing at the time, we may be unable in the future to obtain capital market financing or bank financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. A tightening of credit could also adversely affect our suppliers ability to obtain financing. Delays in suppliers ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing, could negatively affect their ability to perform under contracts with us and cause us to be unable to meet our contract obligations. The inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental costs and delays. We have existing agreements with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional parties, and may in the future enter into additional agreements with such parties. These transactions expose us to potential credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be increased when collateral held by us to secure performance of a counterparty cannot be realized upon a sale or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. 19 Table of Contents Our reputation and our ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents or business partners. We have implemented extensive compliance controls, policies and procedures to prevent and detect reckless or criminal acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing payments to government officials, security clearance breaches, cost accounting and billing, competition and data privacy. However, we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations and monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber security threats, and related disruptions. As a defense contractor, we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit and store electronic information, including classified and other sensitive information of the U.S. Government. While we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols, we face cyber security and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, including threats to our and the U.S. Governments proprietary or classified information. We could face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from groups of hackers. We could also face attempts to gain physical access to classified or other sensitive information located at our facilities. In addition, our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations. Breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities as well as other disruptions could result in potential liability or the loss of contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our nuclear operations subject us to various environmental, regulatory, financial and other risks. The development and operation of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered submarines, nuclear facilities and other nuclear operations subject us to various risks, including:  Potential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from nuclear operations and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials, including nuclear devices and their components;  Unplanned expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security and repair, including repairs required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission;  Reputational harm;  Potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether or not it is within our control; and  Regulatory noncompliance and loss of authorizations or indemnifications necessary for our operations. Failure to properly handle these materials could pose a health risk to humans or wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage, including environmental contamination. If an accident were to occur, its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of corrective action taken by us and emergency response personnel, as well as other factors beyond our control, such as weather and wind conditions. Actions taken in response to an accident could result in significant costs. Our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, DoE and Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In the event of noncompliance, these agencies may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines or shut down our operations, depending upon the assessment of the severity of the situation. Subject to certain requirements and limitations, our government contracts generally provide for indemnity by the U.S. Government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations. We can give no assurance, however, that we will be indemnified for all liabilities that we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations. In addition, revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the U.S. Navy, DoE and Nuclear Regulatory Commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures. While we maintain insurance for certain risks related to transportation of low level nuclear materials and waste, such as contaminated clothing, and for regulatory changes in the health, safety and fire protection areas, there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our 20 Table of Contents costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our nuclear operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Changes in future business conditions could cause business investments, recorded goodwill and/or purchased intangible assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income. As part of our overall strategy, we may, from time to time, acquire a non-controlling or controlling interest in a business. These investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition prices, which prices must be allocated among acquired assets, including goodwill, based upon fair market values. Notwithstanding our due diligence processes and business integration efforts, actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from initial estimates. As of December 31, 2011, goodwill and purchased intangible assets generated from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 14% and 9%, respectively, of our recorded total assets. In the past, we have evaluated goodwill amounts for impairment annually on November 30, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. Purchased intangibles are evaluated when evidence of potential impairment exists. The impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. As a general matter, a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangibles. Adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in an impairment of goodwill and/or other intangible assets. In light of the adverse equity market conditions that began in the second quarter of 2011 and the resultant decline in industry market multiples and our market capitalization, we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of September 30, 2011. As a result, we recorded a preliminary non-cash charge totaling $300 million in the third quarter of 2011, which was subsequently reduced to $290 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 after our completion of an impairment analysis. We also recorded a non-cash charge totaling $2,490 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 for the impairment of goodwill. As with the 2011 impairment, the 2008 impairment was primarily driven by adverse equity market conditions that caused a decrease in market multiples and market capitalization as of the impairment testing dates. The charges reduced goodwill recorded in connection with Northrop Grummans 2001 acquisition of Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. and Litton Industries, Inc. Further declines in market multiples or our stock price or other factors such as significant adverse changes to our future contract awards and operating margins at Ingalls could lead to future impairments. If we are required in the future to recognize additional impairment to goodwill, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow. We are subject to income taxes in the United States. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, timing differences in the recognition of contract income for financial statement purposes and for income tax purposes can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments, which can have a significant impact on cash flow in a particular period. Furthermore, changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. The final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in differences between financial reporting income and taxable income, the results of audits and the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense, profitability and cash flow. As of December 31, 2011, the estimated value of our uncertain tax positions was a potential liability of $9 million, which includes accrued interest and penalties. If our positions are sustained by the taxing authority in our favor, the reversal of the liability would reduce our income tax provision and cost of sales and service revenues. However, we cannot guarantee that such positions will be sustained in our favor. 21 Table of Contents We conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances. We may have limited control over joint venture projects and have returns that are not proportional to the risks and resources we contribute. In any joint venture arrangement, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues, and we can give no assurances that we and our joint venture partners will always reach agreement on significant decisions on a timely basis, or at all. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including any non-performance, default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners, and we typically share liability or have joint and/or several liability with our joint venture partners under these joint venture arrangements. These factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our joint ventures. Operating through joint ventures in which we are the minority holder results in limited control over many decisions made with respect to projects and internal controls relating to projects. These joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control reporting that we follow. As a result, internal control issues may arise that could have a material adverse effect on the joint venture. When entering into joint ventures, in order to establish or preserve relationships with our joint venture partners, we may agree to risks and contributions of resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we could receive, which could reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we would have received if the risks and resources we contributed were always proportionate to our returns. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues, transaction related charges and partner performance. We might in the future make strategic acquisitions and investments, and these activities involve risks and uncertainties. In pursuing our business strategies, we expect to review, evaluate and consider potential acquisitions and investments. In evaluating such transactions, we will have to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and costs of potential liabilities. Furthermore, acquisitions and investments involve certain other risks and uncertainties, including the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses, the challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits anticipated from acquisitions or investments, the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives, the potential value impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses. If we fail to manage acquisitions, investments and other transactions successfully, our financial results, business and future prospects could be harmed. We are subject to various claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us, requiring material future cash payments and/or future material charges against our operating income, materially impairing our financial position. The size, type and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation. We are and may become subject to various environmental claims and other litigation, which if not resolved within established reserves, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Any claims and litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. The following paragraphs describe pending claims and litigation that, if determined adversely for amounts that exceed accrued reserves, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows: In the second quarter of 2007, the U.S. Coast Guard issued a revocation of acceptance under the Deepwater Modernization Program for eight converted 123-foot patrol boats (the vessels) based on alleged hull buckling and shaft alignment problems and alleged nonconforming topside equipment on the vessels. We submitted a written response that argued that the revocation of acceptance was improper. The U.S. Coast Guard advised ICGS, which was formed by us and Lockheed Martin to perform the Deepwater Modernization Program, that it was seeking $96 million from ICGS as a result of the revocation of acceptance. The majority of the costs associated with the conversion effort are associated with the alleged structural deficiencies of the vessels, which were converted under contracts with us and one of our subcontractors. In 2008, the U.S. Coast Guard advised ICGS that the U.S. Coast Guard would support an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice of ICGS and its subcontractors instead of pursuing its $96 million claim independently. The Department of Justice conducted an investigation of ICGS under a sealed False Claims Act complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and decided in early 2009 not to intervene at that time. In February 2009, the District Court unsealed the complaint filed by Michael J. DeKort, a former Lockheed Martin employee, against us, ICGS, and Lockheed Martin Corporation relating to the vessel conversion effort. Damages under the False Claims Act are subject to trebling. Following the resolution of certain claims between the relator and a co-defendant, the District Court entered a final judgment 22 Table of Contents in March 2011, dismissing the relators remaining claims. The relator appealed the dismissal of the remaining claims to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The parties filed their respective briefs and are awaiting further proceedings with the Fifth Circuit. We and our predecessors-in-interest are defendants in several hundred cases filed in numerous jurisdictions around the country wherein former and current employees and various third parties allege exposure to asbestos-containing materials on, or associated with our premises, or while working on vessels constructed or repaired by us. Some cases allege exposure to asbestos-containing materials through contact with our employees and third persons who were on our premises. The cases allege various injuries including those associated with pleural plaque disease, asbestosis, cancer, mesothelioma and other alleged asbestos related conditions. In some cases, several of our former executive officers are also named defendants. In some instances, partial or full insurance coverage is available to us for our potential liability and that of our former executive officers. On January 31, 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice first informed Northrop Grumman and us of a False Claims Act complaint that we believe was filed under seal by one or more plaintiffs (relators) in mid-2010 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The redacted copy of the complaint that we received (the Complaint) alleges that through largely unspecified fraudulent means, Northrop Grumman and we obtained federal funds that were restricted by law for the consequences of Hurricane Katrina, and used those funds to cover costs under certain shipbuilding contracts that were unrelated to Hurricane Katrina and for which Northrop Grumman and we were not entitled to recovery under the contracts. The Complaint seeks monetary damages of at least $835 million, plus penalties, attorneys fees and other costs of suit. Damages under the False Claims Act may be trebled upon a finding of liability. We have agreed to cooperate with the government investigation relating to the False Claims Act Complaint. Until the case is unsealed, we will not know the Department of Justices decision on intervention. Based upon our review to date of the information available to us, we believe we have substantive defenses to the allegations in the Complaint. We believe that the claims as set forth in the Complaint evidence a fundamental lack of understanding of the terms and conditions in our shipbuilding contracts, including the post-Katrina modifications to those contracts, and the manner in which the parties performed in connection with the contracts. We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could affect our ability to compete. We own or have the right to use certain patents, trademarks, copyrights and other forms of intellectual property. The U.S. Government has rights to use certain intellectual property we develop in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property. Our intellectual property is subject to challenge, invalidation, misappropriation or circumvention by third parties. We also rely upon proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how that are not protected by patents. We seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, subcontractors and other parties, as well as through other security measures. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information. In the event our intellectual property rights are infringed, we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our rights in our intellectual property. Litigation to determine the scope of our rights, even if successful, could be costly and a diversion of managements attention away from other aspects of our business. In addition, trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. In instances where third parties have licensed to us the right to use their proprietary intellectual property, we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. Our debt exposes us to certain risks. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,859 million of debt and an additional $650 million available for borrowings and letters of credit under the HII Credit Facility (Credit Facility). Despite our current level of debt, we may be able to incur significant additional debt in the future. Our current level of debt could have important consequences, including:  Increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;  Requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes; 23 Table of Contents  Increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate;  Exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowings under our Credit Facility are subject to variable rates of interest;  Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and  Limiting our ability to borrow additional funds. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we face would be increased. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to service our debt. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future and our ability to borrow under our credit facilities to the extent of available borrowings. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We could experience decreased revenues from our operations and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants and borrowing limitations to which we are subject under our debt. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Credit Facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before the maturity thereof. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our debt, we may have to take actions, such as selling assets, selling equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. We cannot assure you that any such actions, if necessary, could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Restrictive covenants in the indenture governing our senior notes and our Credit Facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies. The indenture governing our senior notes and the terms of our Credit Facility limit our ability, among other things, to:  Incur additional debt;  Pay dividends or make other distributions on, or repurchase or redeem, our stock;  Prepay, redeem or repurchase certain of our debt;  Make investments;  Sell assets;  Enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends;  Consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;  Enter into transactions with our affiliates; and  Incur liens. In addition, our Credit Facility limits our ability to make capital expenditures and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios, including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. These covenants may restrict our financial flexibility, limit any strategic initiatives, restrict our ability to grow or limit our ability to respond to competitive changes. As a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Accordingly, these covenants may limit our ability to successfully execute our strategy and operate our business. Risks Related to the Spin-Off We may incur greater costs as an independent company than we did when we were part of Northrop Grumman. As a former subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, we took advantage of Northrop Grummans size and purchasing power in procuring certain goods and services such as insurance and health care benefits, and technology, such as computer software 24 Table of Contents licenses. We also relied upon Northrop Grumman to provide various corporate functions. As a separate, independent entity, we may be unable to obtain these goods, services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained prior to the spin-off. We may also incur costs for functions previously performed by Northrop Grumman that are higher than the amounts reflected in our historical financial statements, which could cause our profitability to decrease. We may be responsible for U.S. federal income tax liabilities that relate to the spin-off from Northrop Grumman. Our spin-off from Northrop Grumman was structured to minimize the likelihood that Northrop Grumman, Northrop Grummans stockholders and we would be required to recognize any taxable income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the spin-off, except with respect to cash received by Northrop Grummans stockholders in lieu of fractional shares. If all or a portion of the spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, Northrop Grumman would recognize a substantial gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, under IRS regulations, each member of Northrop Grummans consolidated group at the time of the spin-off, including our subsidiaries and us, would be severally liable for the resulting U.S. federal income tax liability. Even if the spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the distribution will be taxable to Northrop Grumman pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code if there are one or more acquisitions, including issuances, of the stock of either Northrop Grumman or us representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of the then-outstanding stock of either corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. Any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the distribution, with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% stockholders and certain compensatory stock issuances, generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless we can rebut that presumption. The tax liability resulting from the application of Section 355(e) would be substantial, and, under IRS regulations, each member of the Northrop Grumman consolidated group at the time of the spin-off, including our subsidiaries and us, would be severally liable for the resulting U.S. federal income tax liability. We agreed with Northrop Grumman, as part of the spin-off, not to enter into any transaction that could reasonably be expected to cause any portion of the spin-off to be taxable to Northrop Grumman, including under Section 355(e). We also agreed to indemnify Northrop Grumman for any tax liabilities resulting from any such transactions. The amount of any such indemnification could be substantial. In addition, these obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company. We do not have a recent operating history as an independent company and our historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of our future results. The historical financial information prior to April 1, 2011, that we have included in this Form 10-K was derived from Northrop Grummans consolidated financial statements and does not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been had we been a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods prior to April 1, 2011. Northrop Grumman did not account for us, and we were not operated, as a single stand-alone entity for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, and the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. In addition, the historical information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be in the future. For example, following the spin-off, changes occurred in our cost structure, funding and operations, including changes in our tax structure, increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with becoming a public, stand-alone company. While we were profitable as part of Northrop Grumman, we cannot guarantee that as a stand-alone company our profits will continue at a similar level. Our customers and prospective customers must consider whether our responsibility on a stand-alone basis satisfies their requirements for engaging in business with us. Under FAR, the government commonly makes affirmative responsibility determinations before entering into new contracts with a contractor. In so doing, the government considers various factors, including financial resources, performance record, technical skills and facilities of a prospective contractor. Our customers and prospective customers will consider whether our responsibility on a stand-alone basis satisfies their requirements for entering into new contracts with us. The U.S. Navy made its determination of contractor responsibility with respect to significant shipbuilding contracts that we have entered into since the 25 Table of Contents spin-off and has found us to be a responsible contractor for those contracts. We believe we are and will continue to be a responsible contractor under FAR. Nonetheless, if, in the future, our customers or prospective customers are not satisfied with our responsibility, including our financial resources, it would likely affect our ability to bid for, obtain or retain contracts, which, if unresolved, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. More generally, our customers will need to develop and retain confidence in us as a partner on a stand-alone basis. We believe that will occur. In the process, however, our customers may continue to request additional information, as well as undertake further audits or take other steps that could lead to delays and increased costs. Our spin-off from Northrop Grumman may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. A court could determine that Northrop Grumman did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for distributing our common stock or taking other action as part of the spin-off, or that we did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring indebtedness, including the new debt incurred by us in connection with the spin-off, transferring assets or taking other action as part of the spin-off and, at the time of such action, we or Northrop Grumman (i) was insolvent or would be rendered insolvent, (ii) had reasonably small capital with which to carry on its business and all business in which it intended to engage or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to repay such debts as they would mature. In such event, the court could void the spin-off as a constructive fraudulent transfer. If such court made this determination, the court could impose a number of different remedies, including voiding our liens and claims against Northrop Grumman or providing Northrop Grumman with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Northrop Grumman and the fair market value of our Company at the time of the spin-off. In connection with the spin-off, Northrop Grumman and we agreed that each of us would be responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses that it owns and operates following the spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us, it is possible that a court would disregard the agreed allocation, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Northrop Grumman, for example, certain tax and/or environmental liabilities, particularly if Northrop Grumman were to refuse or be unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations. Risks Related to Our Common Stock We do not currently pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our future ability to pay dividends on our common stock. We do not currently intend to pay a dividend on our common stock. Going forward, our dividend policy will be established by our board of directors based upon our financial condition, results of operations, and capital requirements, as well as applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant. The terms of the agreements governing our existing debt or debt that we may incur in the future may limit or prohibit the payments of dividends. In addition, the amount of our existing and any additional future debt may limit our ability to pay dividends. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations, then our ability to pay dividends, even if declared by our board of directors, will be impaired. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividend if we do commence the payment of dividends. Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law, as well as regulatory requirements, could delay or prevent a change in control. Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. For example, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Restated Bylaws provide for a classified board, require advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations, place limitations on convening stockholder meetings and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delays or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock and us. 26 Table of Contents We agreed with Northrop Grumman, in connection with our spin-off, not to enter into any transaction involving an acquisition, including issuance, of our common stock or any other transaction, or, to the extent we have the right to prohibit it, to permit any such transaction, that could reasonably be expected to cause the spin-off to be taxable to Northrop Grumman. We also agreed to indemnify Northrop Grumman for any tax liabilities resulting from any such transactions. Generally, Northrop Grumman will recognize taxable gain on the spin-off if there are one or more acquisitions, including issuances, of our capital stock, directly or indirectly, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of our then-outstanding capital stock, and the acquisitions or issuances are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spin-off. Any such shares of our common stock acquired, directly or indirectly, within two years before or after the spin-off, with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% stockholders and certain compensatory stock issuances, will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan unless we can rebut that presumption. The amount of any indemnification payment we may be required to pay to Northrop Grumman resulting from any such transactions could be substantial. Our activities, especially our nuclear shipbuilding operations, are considered vitally important to the U.S. Navy. As such, the U.S. Navy engaged us regarding the incorporation into our contracts of explicit terms regarding notice and approval rights in the event of a change of control of the Company and regarding the U.S. Navys obligations to indemnify us for nuclear work. One such clause, as it applies to our nuclear work, was negotiated and agreed to by the U.S. Navy and us last year and incorporated certain change of control and indemnification provisions into our existing contracts. In order for the U.S. Navy to ensure that a potential buyer of the Company would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner, we are required to provide the U.S. Navy with notice of any potential change of control and obtain the U.S. Navys consent for transferring certain licenses. This clause and other provisions have also been included in solicitations for future U.S. Navy nuclear work. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our obligations to Northrop Grumman in connection with the spin-off and the U.S. Navy under existing contracts may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company that may be beneficial to our stockholders.
