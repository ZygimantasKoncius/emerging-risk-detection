ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the matters described below before making an investment decision. Our business, results of operations or cashflows maybe adversely affected if any of the following risks actually occur. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. The market for our products, in particular our Multi-Mix® products, is rapidly evolving. If we are not able to continually enhance our Multi-Mix® process capabilities so that we will be able to handle the specific, unique requirements our customers’ need for their systems our net sales may suffer. Our future success depends in a large part on our ability to develop and market our Multi-Mix® products and to have the ability to continually refine our process to meet our customers’ specifications. We will also need to continually enhance our existing core products (passive RF and microwave component assemblies, power dividers and other products), lower product cost and develop new products that maintain technological competitiveness. Our core products must meet dynamic customer, regulatory and particular technological requirements and standards, and our Multi-Mix® products must respond to the changing needs of our customers, particularly our OEM customers. These customer requirements might or might not be compatible with our current or future product offerings. We might not be successful in modifying our products and services to address these requirements and standards and our business could suffer. Although we generated a net profit for fiscal year 2008, we recorded net losses in the previous two fiscal years and we may not be able to sustain our profitability. Although we generated a net profit of $98,000 for the year ended January 3, 2009, which included a loss of $142,000 related to our discontinued operations, we recorded a net loss of $5,821,000 for the year ended December 29, 2007, of which $4,387,000 was related to our discontinued operations. We experienced approximately a 34% increase in sales for 2008, from continuing operations, primarily resulting from material increased bookings in 2007 and 2008, and resulting from increased backlog of our traditional and Multi-Mix® products. We may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability in the short-term or long-term, on a quarterly or an annual basis, in subsequent periods. If our financial results fall below the expectations of investors, the price of our common stock may suffer. We rely on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our net sales, and declines in sales to these customers could adversely affect our operating results. Sales to our five largest customers accounted for 62% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended January 3, 2009 and our two largest customers, Raytheon Company and Northrop Grumman Corporation, accounted for 16.7% and 14.6% of our 2008 net sales, respectively. We depend on the continued growth, viability and financial stability of our customers, substantially all of which operate in an environment characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycle, consolidation, and pricing and margin pressures. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue. Consolidation among our customers may further concentrate our business in a limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers. In addition, a significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by a key customer would adversely affect our operating results. In the past, some of our large customers have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of products ordered from us as a result of changes in their business, consolidation or divestitures or for other reasons. We cannot be certain that present or future large customers will not terminate their arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce or delay the amount of products ordered from us, any of which would adversely affect our operating results. A substantial portion of our sales are related to the defense and military communications sectors. However, in times of armed conflict or war, military spending is concentrated on armaments build up, maintenance and troop support, and not on the research and development and specialty applications that are our core strengths and revenue generators. Accordingly, our defense and military product sales may decrease, and should not be expected to increase, at times of armed conflicts or war. 11 Our products are intended for use in various sectors of the satellite and defense industries, which produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles. Factors affecting the satellite, defense and telecommunications industries, in particular the short life cycle of certain products, could seriously harm our customers and reduce the volume of products they purchase from us. These factors include: · the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards that result in short product life cycles; · the inability of our customers to develop and market their products, some of which are new and untested; · the potential that our customers' products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers' products to gain widespread commercial acceptance; · U.S. Government funding being diverted from defense spending to other programs or economic recovery, and · tight credit which could make it difficult for commercial satellite providers to fund their programs. A significant proportion of our revenue is related to U.S Defense spending and commercial satellite programs. Our business plan anticipates significant future sales from our Multi-Mix® products used in defense applications and commercial satellites. Due to overall economic and market conditions, and a new administration, funding may be diverted from defense spending to the efforts of economic recovery. Additionally, there may be limited financing available for commercial satellite programs. These two factors could have an adverse effect on bookings and revenue. The expenses relating to our products might increase, which could reduce our gross margins. In the past, developing engineering solutions, meeting research and development challenges and overcoming production and manufacturing issues have resulted in additional expenses. These expenses create pressure on our average selling prices and may result in decreased margins of our products. We expect that this will continue. In the future, competition could increase, and we anticipate this may result in additional pressure on our pricing. We also may not be able to increase the price of our products in the event that the cost of components or overhead increase. Changes in exchange rates between the United States and Canadian dollars, and other currencies, might result in further disparity between our costs and selling price and hurt our ability to maintain gross margins. We carry inventory and there is a risk we may be unable to dispose of certain items. We procure inventory based on specific customer orders and forecasts. Customers have certain rights of modification with respect to these orders and forecasts. As a result, customer modifications to orders and forecasts affecting inventory previously procured by us and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs may result in excess and obsolete inventory for the related customers. Although we may be able to use some of these excess components and raw materials in other products we manufacture, a portion of the cost of this excess inventory may not be recoverable from customers, nor may any excess quantities be returned to the vendors. We also may not be able to recover the cost of obsolete inventory from vendors or customers. Write offs or write downs of inventory generally arise from: · declines in the market value of inventory; · changes in customer demand for inventory, such as cancellation of orders; and · our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs that result in excess quantities on hand and that we are not able to return to the vendor or charge back to the customer. Our products and therefore our inventories are subject to technological risk. At any time either new products may enter the market or prices of competitive products may be introduced with more attractive features or at lower prices than ours. There is a risk we may be unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner and avoid it becoming obsolete. As of January 3, 2009, our inventories including raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, were valued at $4.9 million reflecting reductions due to valuation allowances for cost overruns of approximately $52,000 against these inventories. In the event we are required to substantially discount our inventory or are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, we would be required to increase our valuation allowances and our operating results could be substantially adversely affected. We depend on a limited number of suppliers. Electronic devices, components and made-to-order assemblies used in our traditional (i.e., non-Multi-Mix) products are generally obtained from a number of suppliers, although certain components are obtained from a limited number of suppliers. Some devices or components are standard items while others are manufactured to our specifications by our suppliers. 12 Except as described below, we believe that most raw materials used in manufacturing our products are available from alternative suppliers. We do not have binding agreements or commitments with our suppliers for the quantity and prices of our raw materials. Our reliance on suppliers, especially sole source or limited suppliers, involves the risks of adequate capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules and costs. While there may be alternative qualified suppliers for some of these components, substitutes for certain materials are not readily available. Any significant interruption in delivery of such items could have an adverse effect on our operations. Manufacturing of our Multi-Mix® products requires certain components and raw materials that currently are only available from a sole supplier or limited number of suppliers, particularly for products intended for specific applications. Our Multi-Mix products utilize certain substrate materials in the fusion bonding process, currently obtained from a single vendor. Although there may be alternative types of substrates that are under evaluation, we have designed its current Multi-Mix® products utilizing the current source of supply, and use of alternative substrates could result in design, engineering, manufacturing, performance and cost challenges and delays. Any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of such raw materials on a timely basis, and at economic prices, could result in design and engineering changes and expenses, shipment delays and/or an inability to manufacture certain Multi-Mix products. Significant increases in the costs of such materials could also have a material adverse effect on our value proposition and marketing efforts with potential customers and our results of operations and profitability. We generally do not obtain firm long-term volume purchase commitments from customers, and, therefore, cancellations, reductions in production quantities and delays in production by our customers could adversely affect our operating results. We generally do not obtain firm long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Customers may cancel their orders, choose not to exercise options for further product purchases, reduce production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons. In the event our customers experience significant decreases in demand for their products and services, our customers may cancel orders, delay the delivery of some of the products that we manufactured or place purchase orders for fewer products than we previously anticipated. Even when our customers are contractually obligated to purchase products from us, we may be unable or, for other business reasons, choose not to enforce our contractual rights. Cancellations, reductions or delays of orders by customers would: · adversely affect our operating results by reducing the volumes of products that we manufacture for our customers; · delay or eliminate recoupment of our expenditures for inventory purchased in preparation for customer orders; and · lower our asset utilization, which would result in lower gross margins. Products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our services and liability claims against us. We manufacture products to our customers' specifications that are highly complex and may at times contain design or manufacturing defects. Defects have been discovered in products we manufactured in the past and despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the future. Defects in the products we manufacture, whether caused by design, manufacturing or component defects, may result in delayed shipments to customers, reduced margins or cancelled customer orders. Should these defects occur in large quantities or frequently, our business reputation may also be tarnished. In addition, these defects may result in liability claims against us. Even if customers are responsible for the defects, we may assume responsibility for any costs or payments. Variations in our quarterly operating results could occur due to factors including changes in demand for our products, the timing of shipments and changes in our mix of net sales. Our quarterly net sales, expenses and operating results have varied in the past and might vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. Quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance, and should not be relied on to predict our future performance. Our short-term expense levels and manufacturing and production facilities infrastructure overhead are relatively fixed and are based on our expectations of future net sales. If we were to experience a reduction in net sales in a quarter, we could have difficulty adjusting our short-term expenditures and absorbing our excess capacity expenses. If this were to occur, our operating results for that quarter would be negatively impacted. Other factors that might cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly basis include: · customer decisions to defer, accelerate or cancel orders; · timing of shipments of orders for our products; · changes in the mix of net sales attributable to higher-margin and lower-margin products; · changes in product mix which could cause unexpected engineering or research and development costs; · announcements or introductions of new products by our competitors; · engineering or production delays due to product defects or quality problems and production yield issues; 13 · dynamic defense budgets which could cause military program delays or cancellations; · limited capital resources making it difficult to fund commercial programs; and · economic recovery programs that may divert government funding from defense budgets. Due to the availability limits, fluctuations in our borrowing base and other terms of our financing agreement, we may experience capital constraints from time to time. On September 29, 2008, we entered into an agreement with Wells Fargo Business Credit (“Wells Fargo”) which replaced our credit facility with Capital One, N.A. The new credit facility with Wells Fargo consists of a three-year $5,000,000 collateralized revolving credit facility, a three-year $500,000 equipment term loan and a three-year $2,500,000 real estate term loan. While the credit facility is expected to adequately provide for our capital needs, the revolving line of credit is subject to availability limits under a borrowing base calculation of 85% of eligible domestic accounts receivable, 75% of eligible foreign accounts receivable, and 30% of eligible inventory with an inventory sublimit of $400,000. Due to these terms from time to time we may experience capital constraints. Additionally the Wells Fargo credit facility contains several financial covenants and while we expect to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants during the next year, were we not to be in compliance with one or more of our financial covenants and be unable to obtain a waiver from Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo would be entitled to accelerate the maturity of amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. This could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have significant competition in our industry. The microwave component and subsystems industry continues to be highly competitive. We compete against many companies, both foreign and domestic, many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources. Our major competitors are Anaren, Cobham, L-3 Communications (Narda), TRM and K&L Microwave. As a direct supplier to OEMs, we also face significant competition from the in-house capabilities of our customers. The principal competitive factors are technical performance, reliability, ability to produce in volume, on-time delivery and price. Based on these factors, we believe that we compete favorably in its markets. The RF Microwave components industry is highly competitive and has become more so as defense spending has changed program-spending profiles. Furthermore, current DoD efforts continue to support troops engaged in existing hostilities around the world. We compete against numerous U.S. and foreign providers with global operations, as well as those who operate on a local or regional basis. In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally. Changes in the industries and sectors we service could significantly harm our ability to compete, and consolidation trends could result in larger competitors that may have significantly greater resources with which to compete against us. We may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to manufacturers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures. Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced sales and margins or loss of market share. Intellectual property rights in our industry are commonly subject to challenge. Substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry. We do not believe our intellectual properties infringe those of others, and are not aware that any third party is infringing our intellectual property rights. A risk always exists that third parties, including current and potential competitors, could claim that our products, or our customers' products, infringe on their intellectual property rights or that we have misappropriated their intellectual property. We may discover that a third party is infringing upon our intellectual property rights, or has been issued an infringing patent. Infringement suits are time consuming, complex, and expensive to litigate. Such litigation could cause a delay in the introduction of new products, require us to develop non-infringing technology, require us to enter into royalty or license agreements, if available, or require us to pay substantial damages. We have agreed to indemnify certain customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. We could incur substantial expenses and costs in case of a successful indemnification claim. A significant negative impact would result if a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the preservation and protection of our product and manufacturing process designs and other proprietary technology. To protect our proprietary technology, we generally limit access to our technology, treat portions of such technology as trade secrets, and obtain confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements from persons with access to the technology. Our agreements with our employees prohibit employees from disclosing any confidential information, technology developments and business practices, and from disclosing any confidential information entrusted to us by other parties. Consultants engaged by us who have access to confidential information generally sign an agreement requiring them to keep confidential and not disclose any non-public confidential information. 14 We currently have 16 active patents. We plan to pursue intellectual property protection in foreign countries, primarily in the form of international patents, in instances where the technology covered is considered important enough to justify the added expense. By agreement, our employees who initiate or contribute to a patentable design or process are obligated to assign their interest in any potential patent to us. Our executive officers, engineers, research and development and technical personnel are critical to our business, and without them we might not be able to execute our business strategy. Our financial performance depends substantially on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. We are dependent in particular on Mason N. Carter, who serves as our Chief Executive Officer, Reynold K. Green, our Chief Operating Officer, J. Robert Patterson, who serves as our Chief Financial Officer and James J. Logothetis, our Chief Technology Officer. We are also dependent upon our other highly skilled engineering, research and development and technical personnel, due to the specialized technical nature of our business. If we lose the services of any of our key personnel and are not able to find replacements in a timely manner, our business could be disrupted, other key personnel might decide to leave, and we might incur increased operating expenses associated with finding and compensating replacements. Our industry is subject to numerous government regulations. Our products are incorporated into telecom and wireless communications systems that are subject to regulation domestically by various government agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission and internationally by other government agencies. In addition, because of our participation in the satellite and defense industry, we are subject to audit from time to time for compliance with government regulations by various governmental agencies. We are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal government regulations relating to environmental laws, as they relate to toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We believe that we operate our business in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, any failure to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Export controls could impact our ability to sell our products to non-U.S. customers. Our products are subject to the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and may, in certain instances, be subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR") administered by the U.S. Department of State. EAR restricts the export of dual-use products and technical data to certain countries, while ITAR restricts the export of defense products, technical data and defense services. We believe we have implemented internal export procedures and controls in order to achieve compliance with the applicable U.S. export control regulations. The U.S. government agencies responsible for administering EAR and ITAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these regulations, and it is possible that these regulations could adversely affect our ability to sell its products to non-U.S. customers. Some of our operations are outside the United States, which poses risks to our business operations. A significant percentage of our sales is derived from the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary in Costa Rica. These sales are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations which include, without limitation, fluctuating currency exchange rates, changing political and economic conditions, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, greater difficulty and expense in administering business abroad, complications in complying with foreign laws and changes in regulatory requirements, and cultural differences in the conduct of business. While we believe that current political and economic conditions in Costa Rica are relatively stable, such conditions may adversely change so as to affect underlying business assumptions about the current opportunities which exist for doing business in this country. In particular, the government in Costa Rica could change or the cost of labor and/or goods and services necessary to our operations may increase. We are also dependent on the availability of adequate air transportation to and from Costa Rica to send and to receive product from our factory. 15 We found material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 29, 2007 and January 3, 2009. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A(T), “Controls and Procedures,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of January 3, 2009. It was also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 29, 2007, previously reported and believed to be effective, were not effective. Our failure to successfully implement our plans to remediate the material weaknesses discovered could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, to fail to produce timely and reliable financial information, and to effectively prevent and detect fraud. Additionally, such failures could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and stock price. If we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2010 and future year-ends as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on our internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the public accounting firm auditing a company's financial statements must audit and report on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. If, at the end of fiscal year 2009, our independent auditors issue other than an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for fiscal year 2009, this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our shares to decline.
