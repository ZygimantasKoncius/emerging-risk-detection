ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Form 10-K. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to those described below, risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business could be harmed, the price of our common stock could decline and our investors may lose all or part of their investment. See the note regarding forward-looking statements included at the beginning of this Form 10-K. 13 WE INCURRED LOSSES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2007, 2006 AND 2005. We incurred losses of $7.2 million, $10.4 million and $ 20.9 million in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The losses in the past three years have generally been due to difficulties completing sales for new application software licenses, deferral of gross profit from contracts in process to future periods, a change in sales mix toward lower margin services, and debt service expenses. We will need to generate additional revenue and reduce expenses to achieve profitability in future periods. In that regard, on April 28, 2005 we announced a strategic plan to integrate our product lines and unify our processes and operations. This plan is a continuation of Island Pacific's drive towards profitability, with a primary goal to accelerate the achievement of that milestone, and includes a reduction of the Company's workforce by approximately 14% percent or 30 employees worldwide, which has resulted in approximately $6.0 million in annual savings compared to costs incurred in the year ended March 31, 2005, as well as consolidating the Company's accounting and finance team into its La Jolla executive offices. If we are unable to achieve profitability, or maintain profitability if achieved, our business and stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to continue operations at current levels, if at all. WE HAVE NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, AND WE HAVE EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS WITH A NUMBER OF OUR SUPPLIERS. At March 31, 2007, we have negative working capital of $17.2 million. We have had difficulty meeting operating expenses, including interest payments on debt, lease payments and supplier obligations. We have extended payment terms with our trade creditors wherever possible. As a result of extended payment arrangements with suppliers, we may be unable to secure products and services necessary to continue operations at current levels from these suppliers. In that event, we will have to obtain these products and services from other parties, which could result in adverse consequences to our business, operations and financial condition, and we may be unable to obtain these products from other parties on terms acceptable to us, if at all. OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY INTERFERE WITH OUR ABILITY TO SELL NEW APPLICATION SOFTWARE LICENSES. Future sales growth may depend on our ability to improve our financial condition. Our past financial condition has made it difficult for us to complete sales of new application software licenses. Because our applications typically require lengthy implementation and extended servicing arrangements, potential customers require assurance that these services will be available for the expected life of the application. These potential customers may defer buying decisions until our financial condition improves, or may choose the products of our competitors whose financial conditions are, or are perceived to be, stronger. Customer deferrals or lost sales will adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND REVENUES HAVE FLUCTUATED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST, AND THEY MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE. Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate in the future as a result of several factors, which are outside of our control including: the size and timing of orders, the general health of the retail industry, the length of our sales cycles and technological changes. If revenue declines in a quarter, our operating results will be adversely affected because many of our expenses are relatively fixed. In particular, sales and marketing, application development and general and administrative expenses do not change significantly with variations in revenue in a quarter. It is likely that in some future quarter our net sales or operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors. If that happens, our stock price will likely decline. Further, due to these fluctuations, we do not believe period to period comparisons of our financial performance are necessarily meaningful nor should they be relied on as an indication of our future performance. WE MAY EXPERIENCE SEASONAL DECLINES IN SALES, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR OPERATING RESULTS TO FALL SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS IN SOME QUARTERS. We may experience slower sales of our applications and services from October through December of each year as a result of retailers' focus on the holiday retail-shopping season. This can negatively affect revenues in our third fiscal quarter and in other quarters, depending on our sales cycles. 14 WE MAY NEED TO RAISE CAPITAL TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. OBTAINING THIS CAPITAL COULD IMPAIR THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT. We may need to raise capital to: o Support unanticipated capital requirements; o Take advantage of acquisition or expansion opportunities; o Continue our current development efforts; o Develop new applications or services; or o Address working capital needs. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors including our application development, sales and marketing activities. We do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed, or available on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise needed funds for the above purposes on acceptable terms, we may be forced to curtail some or all of the above activities and we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated developments. We may raise capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or convertible debt securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and the new securities may have greater rights, preferences or privileges than our existing common stock. INTANGIBLE ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FINANCING. Goodwill, capitalized software, non-compete agreements and other intangible assets represent approximately 90% of our total assets as of March 31, 2007. We may have to impair or write-off these assets, which will cause a charge to earnings and could cause our stock price to decline. Any such impairment will also reduce our assets, as well as the ratio of our assets to our liabilities. These balance sheet effects could make it more difficult for us to obtain capital, and could make the terms of capital we do obtain more unfavorable to our existing stockholders. FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS MAY IMPAIR OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect the prices of our applications and services and our expenses, and foreign currency losses will negatively affect profitability or increase losses. Approximately 17%, 13% and 29% of our net sales from continuing operations were outside North America, principally in Europe and the United Kingdom, in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Many of our expenses related to foreign sales, such as corporate level administrative overhead and development, are denominated in U.S. dollars. When accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international sales and services are converted to U.S. dollars, the resulting gain or loss contributes to fluctuations in our operating results. We do not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risks. IF WE LOSE THE SERVICES OF ANY MEMBER OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT OR KEY TECHNICAL AND SALES PERSONNEL, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN OR ATTRACT ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL PERSONNEL, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESS WILL BE IMPAIRED. We are heavily dependent on our CEO, Barry Schechter. We believe our future success will depend largely upon our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled software programmers, managers and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for personnel is intense, particularly in international markets. The software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel. We compete against numerous companies, including larger, more established companies, for our personnel. We may not be successful in attracting or retaining skilled sales, technical and managerial personnel, which could negatively affect our financial performance and cause our stock price to decline. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE RETAIL INDUSTRY, AND IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY FURTHER DECLINE, OUR REVENUES MAY ALSO DECLINE. RETAIL SALES HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE SLOW. Our future growth is critically dependent on increased sales to the retail industry. We derive the substantial majority of our revenues from the licensing of software applications and the performance of related professional and consulting services to the retail industry. The retail industry as a whole is currently experiencing increased competition and weakening economic conditions 15 that could negatively impact the industry and our customers' ability to pay for our products and services. In addition, the retail industry may be consolidating, and it is uncertain how consolidation will affect the industry. Such consolidation and weakening economic conditions have in the past, and may in the future, negatively impact our revenues, reduce the demand for our products and may negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Specifically, uncertain economic conditions and the specter of terrorist activities have adversely impacted sales of our software applications, and we believe mid-tier specialty retailers may be reluctant during the current economic climate to make the substantial infrastructure investment that generally accompanies the implementation of our software applications, which may adversely impact our business. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION BECAUSE OF THE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE RETAIL SOFTWARE INDUSTRY. We conduct business in an industry characterized by intense competition. Most of our competitors are very large companies with an international presence. We must also compete with smaller companies which have been able to develop strong local or regional customer bases. Many of our competitors and potential competitors are more established, benefit from greater name recognition, and have significantly greater resources than we have. Our competitors may also have lower cost structures and better access to the capital markets than we have. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Our competitors may: o Introduce new technologies that render our existing or future products obsolete, unmarketable or less competitive; o Make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers, which would increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our customers; and o Establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic partners, which would limit our ability to compete through these channels. We could be forced to reduce prices and suffer reduced margins and market share due to increased competition from providers of offerings similar to, or competitive with, our applications, or from service providers that provide services similar to our services. For a further discussion of competitive factors in our industry, see "Description of Business - Competition" below. OUR MARKETS ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, SO OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS HEAVILY ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW APPLICATIONS AND RELATED SERVICES. The retail software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving standards and wide fluctuations in supply and demand. We must cost-effectively develop and introduce new applications and related services that keep pace with technological developments to compete. If we do not gain market acceptance for our existing or new offerings, or if we fail to introduce progressive new offerings in a timely or cost-effective manner, our financial performance will suffer. The success of application enhancements and new applications depends on a variety of factors, including technology selection and specification, timely and efficient completion of design, and effective sales and marketing efforts. In developing new applications and services, we may: o Fail to respond to technological changes in a timely or cost-effective manner; o Encounter applications, capabilities or technologies developed by others that render our applications and services obsolete or non-competitive or that shorten the life cycles of our existing applications and services; o Experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new applications and services; or o Fail to achieve market acceptance of our applications and services. The life cycles of our applications are difficult to estimate, particularly in the emerging electronic commerce market. As a result, new applications and enhancements, even if successful, may become obsolete before we recoup our investment. OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OFFER ONLY LIMITED PROTECTION AND OUR COMPETITORS MAY DEVELOP APPLICATIONS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO OUR APPLICATIONS AND USE SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF CUSTOMERS. WE MAY HAVE TO INITIATE COSTLY LITIGATION TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. Our success and competitive position is dependent in part upon our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our intellectual property. Our intellectual property includes our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and 16 other proprietary information. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be successful. Effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. We hold no patents. Consequently, others may develop, market and sell applications substantially equivalent to ours or utilize technologies similar to those used by us, so long as they do not directly copy our applications or otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights. We may find it necessary to bring claims or initiate litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to protect our trade secrets. These actions would likely be costly and divert management resources. These actions could also result in counterclaims challenging the validity of our proprietary rights or alleging infringement on our part. The ultimate outcome of any litigation will be difficult to predict. OUR APPLICATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THEY INFRINGE ON THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES, WHICH MAY EXPOSE US TO LITIGATION. We may become subject to litigation involving patents or proprietary rights. Patent and proprietary rights litigation entails substantial legal and other costs, and we do not know if we will have the necessary financial resources to defend or prosecute our rights in connection with any such litigation. Responding to and defending claims related to our intellectual property rights, even ones without merit, can be time consuming and expensive and can divert management's attention from other business matters. In addition, these actions could cause application delivery delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements. Royalty or license agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if they are available at all. Any or all of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF OUR OFFERINGS DEPENDS ON STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER COMPANIES. OUR EXISTING STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS MAY NOT ENDURE AND MAY NOT DELIVER THE INTENDED BENEFITS, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO FUTURE STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS. Since we do not possess all of the technical and marketing resources necessary to develop and market our offerings to their target markets, our business strategy substantially depends on our strategic relationships, including licensing software and technology that is integrated into our applications. While some of these relationships are governed by contracts, most are non-exclusive and all may be terminated on short notice by either party. If these relationships terminate or fail to deliver the intended benefits, our development and marketing efforts will be impaired and our revenues may decline. We may not be able to enter into new strategic relationships, which could put us at a disadvantage to those of our competitors which do successfully exploit strategic relationships. OUR PRIMARY COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS ARE IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS, WHICH MAKES THEM MORE VULNERABLE TO DAMAGE OR INTERRUPTION. THIS DAMAGE OR INTERRUPTION COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. Substantially all of our primary computer and telecommunications systems are located in four geographic areas, and these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, earthquake, water damage, sabotage, flood, power loss, technical or telecommunications failure or break-ins. Our insurance may not adequately compensate us for our lost business and will not compensate us for any liability we incur due to our inability to provide services to our customers. Although we have implemented network security measures, our systems are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These disruptions could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of data or the inability to service our customers. Any of these occurrences could impair our ability to serve our customers and harm our business. IF PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS ARE SUCCESSFULLY BROUGHT AGAINST US, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO LIMIT COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR APPLICATIONS. Our business exposes us to product liability risks. Our applications are highly complex and sophisticated and they may occasionally contain design defects or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct. In addition, implementation of our applications may involve customer-specific customization by us or third parties, and may involve integration with systems developed by third parties. These aspects of our business create additional opportunities for errors and defects in our applications and services. Problems in the initial release may be discovered only after the application has been implemented and used over time with different computer systems and in a variety of other applications and environments. Our applications have in the past contained errors that were discovered after they were sold. Our customers have also occasionally experienced difficulties integrating our applications with other hardware or software in their enterprise. 17 We are not currently aware of any material defects in our applications that might give rise to future lawsuits. However, errors or integration problems may be discovered in the future. Such defects, errors or difficulties could result in loss of sales, delays in or elimination of market acceptance, damage to our brand or to our reputation, returns, increased costs and diversion of development resources, redesigns and increased warranty and servicing costs. In addition, third-party products, upon which our applications are dependent, may contain defects which could reduce or undermine entirely the performance of our applications. Our customers typically use our applications to perform mission-critical functions. As a result, the defects and problems discussed above could result in significant financial or other damage to our customers. Although our sales agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims, we do not know if these limitations of liability are enforceable or would otherwise protect us from liability for damages to a customer resulting from a defect in one of our applications or the performance of our services. Our product liability insurance may not cover all claims brought against us. LAURUS MASTER FUND, LTD. (LAURUS) HAS THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH IF ACQUIRED BY LAURUS, MAY ENABLE LAURUS TO EXERCISE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF US. On July 12, 2004 and June 15, 2005, Laurus purchased convertible notes from us in the amounts of $7 million and $3.2 million, respectively which are secured by all of our assets. In addition, Laurus purchased our term note dated November 16, 2005 in the amount of $637,500, which was amended to $1,275,000, $2,025,000 and $2,625,000 on March 23, 2006, November 27, 2006 and March 30, 2007, respectively. The convertible notes may be converted into 50,000,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, warrants and options issued in connection with the sale of the convertible and term notes are exercisable for approximately 28,700,000 shares of our common stock. Consequently, Laurus beneficially owns approximately 48.3% of our outstanding common stock. If Laurus converts the convertible notes to common stock and exercises the warrants and options, it may have effective control over all matters affecting us, including: o The election of all of our directors; o The undertaking of business opportunities that may be suitable for us; o Any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations involving us; o The acquisition or disposition of assets or businesses by us; o Debt and equity financing, including future issuance of our common stock or other securities; o Amendments to our charter documents; o The payment of dividends on our common stock; and o Determinations with respect to our tax returns. LAURUS MASTER FUND, LTD.'S POTENTIAL INFLUENCE ON US COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ANOTHER COMPANY TO ACQUIRE US, WHICH COULD DEPRESS OUR STOCK PRICE. Laurus's potential effective voting control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or our stockholders. As a result, Laurus's potential effective control could reduce the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our stock, or could prevent any party from attempting to acquire us at any price. OUR STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN HIGHLY VOLATILE. The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. When we or our competitors announce new customer orders or services, change pricing policies, experience quarterly fluctuations in operating results, announce strategic relationships or acquisitions, change earnings estimates, experience government regulatory actions or suffer from generally adverse economic conditions, our stock price could be affected. Some of the volatility in our stock price may be unrelated to our performance. Recently, companies similar to ours have experienced extreme price fluctuations, often for reasons unrelated to their performance. For further information on our stock price trends, see "Price Range of Common Stock" below. 18 WE HAVE NEVER PAID A DIVIDEND ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We have not previously paid any cash or other dividend on our common stock. We anticipate that we will use our earnings and cash flow for repayment of indebtedness, to support our operations, and for future growth, and we do not have any plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Future equity financing(s) may further restrict our ability to pay dividends. THE TERMS OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK MAY REDUCE THE VALUE OF YOUR COMMON STOCK. We are authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may determine the terms of preferred stock without further action by our stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect your rights or reduce the value of your common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. These terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions. We are actively seeking capital, and some of the arrangements we are considering may involve the issuance of preferred stock. SHARES ISSUABLE UPON THE EXERCISE OF OPTIONS OR WARRANTS, CONVERSION OF DEBENTURES, DIVIDENDS ON CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, OR ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS IN CERTAIN AGREEMENTS COULD DILUTE YOUR STOCK HOLDINGS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE. We have issued options and warrants to acquire common stock to our employees and certain other persons at various prices, some of which are or may in the future have exercise prices at below the market price of our stock. We currently have outstanding options and warrants for 57,701,422 shares as of March 31, 2007. Of these options and warrants, as of March 31, 2007, approximately 31,000,000 have exercise prices above the recent market price of $0.09 per share (as of March 31, 2007), and approximately 27,000,000 have exercise prices at or below that recent market price. Our existing stock option plans currently have approximately 6,500,000 shares available for issuance as of March 31, 2007. Future options issued under the plan may have further dilutive effects. The issuance of additional shares pursuant to these options, warrants, convertible debentures or anti-dilution provisions will cause immediate and possibly substantial dilution to our stockholders. Further, subsequent sales of the shares in the public market could depress the market price of our stock by creating an excess in supply of shares for sale. Issuance of these shares and sale of these shares in the public market could also impair our ability to raise capital by selling equity securities. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REALIZE ALL OF THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITIONS OF PAGE DIGITAL OR RTI. On January 30, 2004, we acquired Page Digital and on June 1, 2004, we acquired Retail Technologies, Inc. (see "Recent Transactions" below). These acquisitions involve integrating two companies that previously operated independently into Island Pacific. The difficulties of combining these companies' operations include the following business risks. BUSINESS RISKS FACED BY PAGE DIGITAL COULD DISADVANTAGE OUR BUSINESS. Page Digital is a developer of multi-channel commerce software and faces several business risks that could disadvantage our business. These risks include many of the risks that we face, described above, as well as: o DEFECTS IN PRODUCTS COULD DIMINISH DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN LOSS OF REVENUES - From time to time errors or defects may be found in Page Digital's existing, new or enhanced products, resulting in delays in shipping, loss of revenues or injury to Page Digital's reputation. Page Digital's customers use its products for business critical applications. Any defects, errors or other performance problems could result in damage to Page Digital's customers' businesses. These customers could seek significant compensation from Page Digital for any losses. Further, errors or defects in Page Digital's products may be caused by defects in third-party software incorporated into Page Digital products. If so, Page Digital may not be able to fix these defects without the assistance of the software providers. 19 o FAILURE TO FORMALIZE AND MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS COULD REDUCE REVENUES AND HARM PAGE DIGITAL'S ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT PRODUCTS - A significant portion of Page Digital's sales are influenced by the recommendations of systems integrators, consulting firms and other third parties who assist with the implementation and maintenance of Page Digital's products. These third parties are under no obligation to recommend or support Page Digital's products. Failing to maintain strong relationships with these third parties could result in a shift by these third parties toward favoring competing products, which could negatively affect Page Digital's software license and service revenues. o PAGE DIGITAL'S PRODUCT MARKETS ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, SO PAGE DIGITAL'S SUCCESS DEPENDS HEAVILY ON ITS ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW APPLICATIONS AND RELATED SERVICES - The retail software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving standards and wide fluctuations in supply and demand. Page Digital must cost-effectively develop and introduce new applications and related services that keep pace with technological developments to compete. If Page Digital fails to gain market acceptance for its existing or new offerings or if Page Digital fails to introduce progressive new offerings in a timely or cost-effective manner, our financial performance may suffer. o FAILURE TO PROTECT PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AGAINST PAGE DIGITAL COULD RESULT IN PAGE DIGITAL LOSING VALUABLE ASSETS OR BECOMING SUBJECT TO COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING LITIGATION - Page Digital's success and ability to compete depend on its proprietary rights and intellectual property. Page Digital relies on trademark, trade secret and copyright laws to protect its proprietary rights and intellectual property. Page Digital also has one issued patent. Despite Page Digital's efforts to protect intellectual property, a third party could obtain access to Page Digital's software source code or other proprietary information without authorization, or could independently duplicate Page Digital's software. Page Digital may need to litigate to enforce intellectual property rights. If Page Digital is unable to protect its intellectual property it may lose a valuable asset. Further, third parties could claim Page Digital has infringed their intellectual property rights. Any claims, regardless of merit, could be costly and time-consuming to defend. o COMPETITION IN THE SOFTWARE MARKET IS INTENSE AND COULD REDUCE PAGE DIGITAL'S SALES OR PREVENT THEM FROM ACHIEVING PROFITABILITY - The market for Page Digital's products is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Competition is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of Page Digital's market share, any one of which could reduce future revenues or earnings. Further, most of Page Digital's competitors are large companies with greater resources, broader customer relationships, greater name recognition and an international presence. As a result, Page Digital's competitors may be able to better respond to new and emerging technologies and customer demands. BUSINESS RISKS FACED BY RTI COULD DISADVANTAGE OUR BUSINESS. RTI is a provider of retail management store solutions to small through mid-tier retailers via an international network of retailers and faces several business risks that could disadvantage our business. These risks include many of the risks that we face, described above, as well as: o RTI FACES INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE RETAIL POINT OF SALE INDUSTRY - RTI operates in an extremely competitive industry, which is subject to rapid technological and market changes. We anticipate that the competition will increase as more companies focus on providing technology solutions to small and mid-tier retailers. Many of our current and potential competitors, such as Microsoft, have more resources to devote to product development, marketing and distribution. While RTI believes that it has competitive strengths in its market, there can be no assurance that RTI will continue to compete successfully against larger more established competitors. o RTI IS DEPENDENT ON THEIR VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS (VARS) - RTI does not have a direct sales force and relies on VARs to distribute and sell its products. RTI currently has approximately 67 VARs - 27 in North America, 7 in South America, 11 in Asia, 19 in Europe and the Middle East, 1 in Africa, and 1 each in Australia and New Zealand. Combined, RTI's five largest VARs account for approximately 14% of its revenues, although no one is over 4%. RTI's VARs are independently owned businesses and there can be no assurance that one or more will not go out of business or cease to sell RTI products. Until a replacement VAR could be recruited, and trained, or until an existing VAR could expand into the vacated territory, such a loss could result in a disruption in RTI's revenue and profitability. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that an adequate replacement could be located. 20 o A PROLONGED SLOWDOWN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT RTI'S REVENUES - A slowdown in the global economy might lead to decreased capital spending, fewer new retail business start ups, and slower new store expansion at existing retail businesses. Such conditions, even on a regional basis, could severely impact one or more of RTI's VARs and result to a disruption in RTI's revenues and profitability. o RTI'S PRODUCT MARKETS ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, SO RTI'S SUCCESS DEPENDS HEAVILY ON ITS ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW APPLICATIONS AND RELATED SERVICES - We believe RTI's ability to succeed in its market is partially dependent on its ability to identify new product opportunities and rapidly, cost-effectively bring them to market. However, there is no guarantee that they will be able to gain market acceptance for any new products. In addition, there is no guarantee that one of RTI competitors will not be able to bring competing applications to market faster or market them more effectively. Failure to successfully develop new products, bring them to market and gain market acceptance could result in decreased market share and ultimately have a material adverse affect on RTI. o RTI DOES NOT HOLD ANY PATENTS OR COPYRIGHTS; ANY TERMINATION OF OR ADVERSE CHANGE TO RTI'S LICENSE RIGHTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS BUSINESS - RTI has a license to develop, modify, market, sell, and support its core technology from a third party. Any termination of, or disruption in this license could have a material adverse affect on RTI's business. Further, we believe that most of the technology used in the design and development of RTI's core products is widely available to others. Consequently, there can be no assurance that others will not develop, and market applications that are similar to RTI's, or utilize technologies that are equivalent to RTI's. Likewise, while RTI believes that its products do not infringe on any third party's intellectual property, there can be no assurance that they will not become involved in litigation involving intellectual property rights. If such litigation did occur, it could have a material adverse affect on RTI's business. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
