D. RISK FACTORS IN ADDITION TO OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW BEFORE DECIDING TO INVEST IN OUR ORDINARY SHARES OR ADSS. ANY OF THESE RISK FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS. IN THAT CASE, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES AND ADSS COULD DECLINE, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL RELEVANT RISK FACTORS AND, THEREFORE, THE FOLLOWING LIST SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES. WE HAVE NOT BEEN PROFITABLE FOR THE LAST FOUR FISCAL YEARS, AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL RETURN TO PROFITABILITY While we reported an operating profit and net income for the 2000 fiscal year, we incurred net losses of EUR 5,743,000, EUR 20,420,000, EUR 10,208,000 and EUR 41,386,000 for fiscal years 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We cannot assure you that our net losses will not continue or increase in the future or that we will return to being profitable. Please see "Item 3. Key Information" and "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects" for information regarding our financial condition. OUR REVENUES, PROFITABILITY AND GROWTH COULD DECLINE IF THE GROWTH OF THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS MARKET SLOWS We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the wireless communications market, which experienced difficult conditions in 2001, 2002 and the first half of 2003. Our revenues from wireless communications applications accounted for 78%, 75% and 71% in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Our revenues increased 25% from EUR 92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to EUR 116.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 20% from EUR 77.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to EUR 92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to new products introduced to volume production with more functionality and accordingly, higher selling prices. Worldwide sales of cellular handsets increased in the second half of 2003 and 2004 (particularly in Asia), but we can give no assurance that this trend will continue. In future periods, conditions in the wireless communications market may fluctuate, which could result in either growth or decline. Conditions in the wireless communications market may be influenced by numerous factors, including: o national and regional regulatory environments; o general economic conditions; o advances in competing telecommunication and information technologies; o manufacturing capacity; and o perceived health risks to cellular phone users. Any significant constraints on the growth of, or downturns in, the wireless communications market could have a negative effect on our future revenues and profit growth. WE MAY BECOME A PASSIVE FOREIGN INVESTMENT COMPANY We may become a passive foreign investment company. Whether we become a passive foreign investment company will depend, among other things, upon the amount of our passive income and the value of our passive assets, the growth in our business revenues and our market value in the future. Since goodwill represents a substantial part of our non-passive assets, changes in the market value of our shares, which have been significant and could continue to be significant, can cause us to become a passive foreign investment company. If we become a passive foreign investment company, US holders would be subject to additional US taxes under special US federal income tax rules. See "Item 10. Additional Information-US Federal Income Taxation-Passive Foreign Investment Company". IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ADAPT RAPIDLY TO CHANGING MARKETS AND TECHNOLOGY, WE MAY LOSE CUSTOMERS AND BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP NEW BUSINESS The market in which we compete is characterized by continuous development and technological improvement. As a result, our success depends on our ability to develop new designs and products on a cost-effective, timely basis. Our future success also depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to new market trends, to rapidly implement new designs that satisfy customers' desires, and to keep abreast of technological changes within the semiconductor industry generally. If we fail to successfully design and develop new products and product enhancements that respond to technological changes and customer requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may be unable to respond to competitive challenges. We could also lose customers and experience a lower demand for our products. THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL IN NATURE, AND THIS RESULTS IN PERIODIC OVERCAPACITY The semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and, at various times, has experienced significant economic downturns characterized by production over-capacity, reduced product demand and erosion of average sale prices. We and many of our competitors have historically expanded during periods of increased demand, resulting in overcapacity. See "Item 4. Business Overview-Industry Background." WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, WE COULD LOSE CUSTOMERS Many of our direct and indirect competitors are major international semiconductor companies with substantially greater technical, financial and marketing resources and name recognition. In addition, in the future we may face increased competition from smaller, niche semiconductor design companies. Further, some of our customers could decide to satisfy their applications specific integrated circuit ("ASIC") and application specific standard product ("ASSP") demands through in-house design and production. We compete with these competitors primarily on the basis of the following attributes: o price; o design cycle time; o reliability; o performance; o customer and logistical support; and o reputation. Our inability to compete effectively on any of these bases or others could affect the pricing of and demand for our products. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-Competition". THE LOSS OF ONE OF OUR PRINCIPAL FOUNDRY RELATIONSHIPS OR ASSEMBLY SERVICES OR A DELAY IN FOUNDRY OR ASSEMBLY PRODUCTION MAY RESULT IN A MATERIAL LOSS OF PRODUCTION AND REVENUES A material production delay, limitation or other detrimental effect on production at one of our principal foundries could result in a material loss of revenue until such production is restored or until the affected product lines are transferred to another foundry. A foundry's production can be delayed, limited or detrimentally affected by, among other things: o difficulties in the manufacturing process; o the complexity of individual designs; o failure of suppliers to meet delivery dates; o shortages in raw materials or silicon impurities; and o other factors or circumstances outside our control. We also outsource our wafer assembly services, including bonding and packaging, to selected assemblers in Europe and Asia. If we lose one or more of our assemblers or if any assembler fails to meet its delivery dates, fails to meet quality standards set by us, limits production volumes or increases prices due to capacity constraints, we could experience significant delays and loss of production, which could result in a material loss of revenues. For more information on outsourcing of production and assembly of our products, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-Our Product Cycle-Manufacture of Wafers". OBTAINING ACCESS TO MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AT SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING PLANTS MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT AND COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS AND A MATERIAL LOSS OF REVENUES We outsource our silicon wafer fabrication and, therefore, access to semiconductor manufacturing plants, or "fabs", is necessary to our business. Access to fabs, however, may become increasingly difficult in future years as the semiconductor industry continues to grow. If we are unable to obtain access to sufficient manufacturing capacity at fabs, we could experience significant delays or a loss of production, which could result in a material loss of revenues. Additionally, if there is a shortage of available manufacturing capacity at fabs, we may have to pay more for the manufacture of silicon wafers. WE CURRENTLY DEPEND ON A FEW CUSTOMERS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, AND THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE CUSTOMERS MAY RESULT IN A MATERIAL DECLINE IN OUR REVENUES We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of wireless communications manufacturers that require high performance, low cost semiconductor products. Sales to two customers individually accounted for 65% and 61% of total revenues in 2004 and 2002, respectively. Sales to one customer individually accounted for 65% of total revenues in 2003. Our revenues declined for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, primarily as a result of significantly reduced revenue from one major customer. Although revenues increased in 2004 and 2003, respectively, the further loss of revenue from one or more major customers would result in a material decrease in our revenues in future periods. In addition, because we depend on a relatively small, focused customer base, we are exposed to downward pricing pressures from those customers. PERCEIVED HEALTH RISKS RELATING TO CELLULAR HANDSETS COULD LEAD TO DECREASED DEMAND FOR ASICS Some members of the medical community have expressed concern that the electromagnetic signals from cellular handsets may cause brain tumors, memory loss or DNA and genetic damage. The perceived or actual health risks and related publicity or litigation could reduce the demand for cellular handsets and ASICs and, thus, reduce our sales and revenues. OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND REPUTATION MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR ASICS, OR THE ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS OF WHICH THEY ARE A PART, CONTAIN DEFECTS THAT CAUSE DAMAGE OR INJURY Our ASICs form part of larger complex products such as cellular phones and airbag sensors. Defects in our ASICs, or in the electronic systems of which they are part, may directly or indirectly result in damage to third parties' property, physical injury or even death. If such defects occur, they may result in: o product liability claims; o expensive and time-consuming modifications; o damaged customer relationships; o damage to our reputation; and o loss of market share. Although we carry insurance, our insurance coverage may not cover potential claims to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all potential liability. In addition, we may not have sufficient cash reserves to cover such liabilities. If we do not have sufficient insurance or cash reserves, we may be forced to sell assets or divert cash that may have otherwise been used for capital expenditures or operating costs. OUR PRODUCTS ARE DIFFICULT TO MANUFACTURE AND MANUFACTURING DEFECTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS The manufacture of our products is a precise and complex process. The production cycle for new products is characterized by the need to achieve increasingly high yields from batches of ASICs. If we are unable to achieve increasingly high yields, or if one of our products is defective, this could result in a delay in the time it takes for our products to reach the market in quantity, a loss of customers or damage to our business reputation, which could materially affect our results of operations. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IF WE LOSE ANY OF OUR KEY EXECUTIVES Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key senior executives, particularly of our management members. We rely heavily on senior management's special knowledge and its ability to maintain relationships with our key customers. If we lose any of our key senior executives, we may not be able to retain our current customers or develop business with new customers. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IF WE CANNOT HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED ENGINEERS AND SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL Our future success depends on our ability to continue enhancing and introducing new generations of technology. We are therefore particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified design, process and testing engineers with the requisite educational background and industry experience. Competition in the market for qualified engineers, particularly those with significant industry experience, is intense. Our ability to successfully grow will also depend on our ability to attract and retain sales and marketing personnel. The loss of the services of any of our senior engineers or our inability to attract and retain sales and marketing personnel could hurt our product development efforts or business relationships. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND KNOW-HOW FROM BEING COPIED OR USED BY OTHERS, OUR COMPETITORS MAY GAIN ACCESS TO ITS CONTENT AND TECHNOLOGY We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures. We also rely on copyright, trade secret and patent laws to protect our intellectual property and know-how. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, it may be possible for someone to copy aspects of our designs and products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights. Questions of infringement in the semiconductor field involve highly technical and subjective analysis. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any litigation, whether or not determined in our favor, would probably be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations. Adverse determinations in litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses from third parties. Moreover, there may not be effective trade mark, copyright and trade secret protection in every country in which our technology is or may be used in the future. This would increase the possibility of infringement of our intellectual property. THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND BY THE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS We sell our products primarily in Europe, Asia and the United States. Our operations are subject to risks inherent in international business activities, including: o general economic conditions in each country; o costs of complying with a variety of regulatory environments; o currency conversion risks and the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates; o taxation by multiple government entities; o tariffs and other trade barriers; and o staffing and managing foreign operations. We conduct our business primarily in Euro, which is financial statement reporting currency, and US Dollars. We may be unable to match US dollar inflows and outflows adequately, which increases our exposure to changing exchange rates. Please see "Foreign Currencies" under "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects" for further information on the impact of exchange rates. US-RESIDENT SHAREHOLDERS MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS THAN THEY WOULD AS SHAREHOLDERS OF A US-BASED CORPORATION Dialog Semiconductor Plc is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. The rights of our shareholders and the responsibilities of the members of the board of directors of a corporation under English law are different from those under US law. Furthermore, a majority of the members of our board of directors and the majority of our assets are located outside the United States. Therefore, US-resident shareholders may find it more difficult to protect their interests and enforce a judgment of a US court as compared to shareholders of a US-based corporation. In addition, it may be difficult to bring an action seeking a remedy under US securities laws in a non-US court. OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED IF JUDGMENTS UNDERLYING ANY OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES WERE TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE A number of our accounting policies involve judgments about various factors, including our financial and operating condition, the wireless communications industry and general economic conditions. There is a reasonable likelihood that our future operating results could be materially affected if the conditions or assumptions on which our judgments are based were to significantly change. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Critical Accounting Policies and Related Uncertainties".
