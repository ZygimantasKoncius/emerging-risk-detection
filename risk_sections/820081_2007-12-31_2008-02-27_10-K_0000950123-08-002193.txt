ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. If any of the following risks occur, the Company's business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additionally, risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that it currently deems immaterial also may impair its business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future. WE MAY PURSUE TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY CAUSE US TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT CHARGES TO EARNINGS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. We regularly review potential transactions related to technologies, products, product rights and businesses complementary to our business. These transactions could include mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances or licensing agreements. In the future, we may choose to enter into these transactions at any time. As a result of acquiring businesses or entering into other significant transactions, we have previously experienced, and may continue to experience, significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses that may include transaction costs, closure costs or costs related to the write-off of acquired in-process research and development. These costs may also include substantial fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial printing costs, severance and other closure costs associated with the elimination of duplicate or discontinued products, employees, operations and facilities. IF WE MAKE ACQUISITIONS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY INTEGRATING THE BUSINESSES. We continually explore and conduct discussions with many third parties regarding possible acquisitions. Our ability to continue to achieve our goals may depend upon our ability to effectively integrate such businesses, to achieve cost efficiencies and to manage these businesses as part of our company. However, we may experience difficulty integrating the merged companies. As a result of uncertainty following an acquisition and during the integration process, we could experience disruption in our business or employee base. If we are not able to successfully blend our products and technologies with the acquired business to create the advantages the acquisition was intended to create, it may effect our results of operations, our ability to develop and introduce new products and the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, there may be overlap between our products, services or customers, and the combined company may create conflicts in relationships or other commitments detrimental to the integrated businesses. IF WE FAIL TO IMPROVE THE OPERATIONS OF FUTURE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE OUR GROWTH STRATEGY. Some of the businesses we may acquire could have significantly lower operating margins than we do prior to the time we acquire them. In the past, we have occasionally experienced temporary delays in improving the operating margins of these acquired businesses. In the future, if we are unable to improve the operating margins of acquired businesses or operate them profitably, we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy. COMPANIES MAY DISCONTINUE OR DECREASE THEIR USAGE OF OUR SERVICES. We have observed increasing pressure on the part of our customers to reduce spending, including the use of our services, as a result of negative economic trends generally and in the pharmaceutical industry. These customers could discontinue or decrease their usage of our services, including as a result of an economic slowdown in the overall United States or foreign economies. - -------- (dollars in thousands, except share data) 7 COMPETITION OR A REDUCTION IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE SALES. The markets for our products are competitive and price sensitive. Other suppliers have significant financial, operational, sales and marketing resources, and experience in research and development. These and other companies may have developed or could in the future develop new technologies that would compete with our products or render our products obsolete. In addition, demand for our products may weaken due to a reduction in research and development budgets, loss of distributors or other factors. The markets for certain of our products are also subject to specific competitive risks and can be highly price competitive. Our competitors have competed in the past by lowering prices on certain products. Our competitors may lower prices on these or other products in the future and we may, in certain cases, respond by lowering our prices. Conversely, failure to anticipate and respond to price competition may hurt our market share. We believe that customers in our markets display loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product. Therefore, it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors. To the extent we are unable to be the first to develop and supply new products, our competitive position may suffer. OUR FAILURE TO OBTAIN NEW CONTRACTS OR RENEW EXISTING CONTRACTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Many of our contracts are short-term in duration. As a result, we must continually replace our contracts with new contracts to sustain our revenue. In addition, many of our long-term contracts may be cancelled or delayed by clients for any reason upon notice. The Company currently has a long-term sales contract that accounts for more than 10% of sales that is scheduled to expire at the end of 2013. There is no guarantee that this contract will be renewed. OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY UNEXPECTEDLY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS. The Company's revenue and operating results have fluctuated, and could continue to fluctuate, on a quarterly basis. The operating results for a particular quarter may be lower than expected as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of contracts; the delay or cancellation of a contract; the mix of services provided; seasonal slowdowns in different parts of the world; the timing of start-up expenses for new services and facilities; and changes in government regulations. Because a high percentage of the Company's costs are relatively fixed in the short term (such as the cost of maintaining facilities and compensating employees), any one of these factors could have a significant impact on the Company's quarterly results. In some quarters, the Company's revenue and operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to any of the factors described above. In such event, the trading price of the Company's common stock would likely decline, even if the decline in revenue did not have any long-term adverse implications for the Company's business. FAILURE TO OBTAIN PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS FROM THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE AND DELIVER OUR PRODUCTS. We rely on third-party manufacturers to supply many of our raw materials, product components, and in some cases, entire products. In addition, we have a single source for supplies of some raw materials and components to our products. Manufacturing problems may occur with these and other outside sources. If such problems occur, we cannot ensure that we will be able to manufacture our products profitably or on time. ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE DRUG DEVELOPMENT PROCESS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. The manufacturing of pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities, including the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries. The Company's business depends in part on strict government regulation of the drug development process. Legislation may be introduced and enacted from time to time to modify regulations administered by the FDA and governing the drug approval process. Any - -------- (dollars in thousands, except share data) 8 significant reduction in the scope of regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. VIOLATIONS OF cGMP AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. All facilities and manufacturing techniques used for manufacturing of products for clinical use or for commercial sale in the United States must be operated in conformity with cGMP regulations as required by the FDA. The Company's facilities are subject to scheduled periodic regulatory and customer inspections to ensure compliance with cGMP and other requirements applicable to such products. A finding that the Company had materially violated these requirements could result in regulatory sanctions, the loss of a customer contract, the disqualification of data for client submissions to regulatory authorities and a mandated closing of the Company's facilities. Any such violations would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. LITIGATION MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. Complex or extended litigation could cause the Company to incur large expenditures and distract our management. For example, lawsuits by employees, stockholders, counterparties to acquisition and divestiture contracts, collaborators, distributors, customers, or end-users of our products or services could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. Disputes from time to time with such companies or individuals are not uncommon, and we cannot be assured that we will always be able to resolve such disputes out of court or on terms favorable to the Company. Refer to Note 17 for a discussion of the Company's environmental and legal matters. LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD HURT OUR BUSINESS. The Company depends on a number of key executives. The loss of services of any of the Company's key executives could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. The Company also depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical employees. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to retain its existing scientific and technical employees, or to attract and retain additional qualified employees. The Company's inability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical employees would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. POTENTIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, ERRORS AND OMISSIONS CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH SERVICES WE PERFORM AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS BETWEEN US AND OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. The Company manufactures products intended for use by the public. These activities could expose the Company to risk of liability for personal injury or death to persons using such products, although the Company does not presently market or sell the products to end users. The Company seeks to reduce its potential liability through measures such as contractual indemnification provisions with clients (the scope of which may vary from client-to-client, and the performances of which are not secured), exclusion of services requiring diagnostic or other medical services, and insurance maintained by clients. The Company could be materially and adversely affected if it were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of the indemnification agreements, if the indemnity, although applicable, is not performed in accordance with its terms or if the Company's liability exceeds the amount of applicable insurance or indemnity. In addition, the Company could be held liable for errors and omissions in connection with the services it performs. The Company currently maintains product liability and errors and omissions insurance with respect to these risks. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company's insurance coverage will be adequate or that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to the Company. - -------- (dollars in thousands, except share data) 9 The Company also indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at the Company's request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has a "Director and Officer" insurance policy that covers a portion of any potential exposure. The Company could be materially and adversely effected if it were required to pay damages or incur legal costs in connection with a claim above its insurance limits. ASSESSMENTS BY VARIOUS TAX AUTHORITIES MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN OUR ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. While the Company believes that it has adequately provided for any such assessments, future settlements may be materially different than we have provided. In recent years, as described more fully in Note 8, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against all net domestic and certain foreign deferred tax assets. Until such time as the Company's domestic and certain foreign profitability is restored and considered by management to be sustainable for the foreseeable future, the Company will not record the income tax benefit or expense for domestic pre-tax losses and income respectively, and as such will likely experience significant volatility in its effective tax rate. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DEBT. The Company has a $200,000 revolving credit facility of which $101,600 was outstanding at December 31, 2007. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the credit facility, we will be in default. Even if we are able to meet our debt service obligations, the amount of debt we have could adversely affect us in a number of ways, including: - limiting our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, or other purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business; - placing us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors who have lower levels of debt; - making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and - requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash to pay principal and interest on our debt, instead of investing those funds in the business. INTERNATIONAL UNREST OR FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS. Our international revenues, which include revenues from our non-U.S. subsidiaries and export sales from the U.S., represented 79% and 77% of our product revenues in 2007 and 2006, respectively. There are a number of risks arising from our international business, including: - foreign currencies we receive for sales outside the U.S. could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the U.S. dollar and reduce the amount of revenue that we recognize; - the possibility that unfriendly nations or groups could boycott our products; - general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate; - potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures; - more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; - unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; - -------- (dollars in thousands, except share data) 10 - the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations; - longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries; and - import and export licensing requirements. A significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency. We recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period incurred. As a result, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction gains and losses. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures, and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. We engage in limited foreign exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure, but our strategies are short-term in nature and may not adequately protect our operating results from the full effects of exchange rate fluctuations. THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK COULD BE VOLATILE. The market price of our common stock in the future may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including: - quarterly fluctuations in our operating income and earnings per share results; - technological innovations or new product introductions by us or our competitors; - economic conditions; - disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights; - changes in earnings estimates and market growth rate projections by market research analysts; - sales of common stock by existing holders; - loss of key personnel; and - securities class actions or other litigation. The market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet any guidance that we may, from time to time, publicly announce related to our expected sales growth, profitability and other financial and operational metrics, and our ability to meet analysts' expectations. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. INCIDENTS RELATED TO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Portions of our operations require the controlled use of hazardous materials. Although we are diligent in designing and implementing safety procedures to comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state, and local regulations, the risk of accidental contamination of property or injury to individuals from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an incident, we could be liable for any damages that result, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, any incident could partially or completely shut down our research and manufacturing facilities and operations. We generate waste that must be transported to approved storage, treatment and disposal facilities. The transportation and disposal of such waste are required to meet applicable state and federal statutes and regulations. The storage, treatment and disposal of such waste potentially exposes us to environmental liability if, in the future, such transportation and disposal are deemed to have violated such statues or regulations or if the storage, treatment and disposal facilities are inadequate and are proved to have damaged the environment. - -------- (dollars in thousands, except share data) 11 The Company is also party to several environmental remediation investigations and cleanups and, along with other companies, has been named a "potential responsible party" for certain waste disposal sites. The Company has also retained the liabilities with respect to certain pre-closing environmental matters associated with the sale of the Rutherford Chemicals business. Refer to Note 17 for a discussion of the Company's environmental matters. THE POSSIBILITY WE WILL BE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGIES COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies. However, we cannot be assured that patents will be granted on any of our patent applications. We also cannot be assured that the scope of any of our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection. We only have patents issued in selected countries. Therefore, third parties can make, use, and sell products covered by our patents in any country in which we do not have patent protection. In addition, our issued patents or patents we license could be successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented so that our patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier. We provide our customers the right to use our products under label licenses that are for research purposes only. These licenses could be contested, and we cannot be assured that we would either be aware of an unauthorized use or be able to enforce the restrictions in a cost- effective manner. If a third party claimed an intellectual property right to technology we use, we may need to discontinue an important product or product line, alter our products and processes, defend our right to use such technology in court or pay license fees. Although we may, under these circumstances, attempt to obtain a license to such intellectual property, we may not be able to do so on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, if our products are found to infringe on a third party's intellectual property, we may be required to pay damages for past infringement, and lose the ability to sell certain products or receive licensing revenues. COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGING REGULATION OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, are creating uncertainty for companies. These new or changed laws and standards are subject to multiple interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specification. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies which could result in higher costs necessitated by revisions to disclosures and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result of the efforts to comply with the evolving laws and regulations increased general and administrative expenses have been experienced and are likely to continue.
