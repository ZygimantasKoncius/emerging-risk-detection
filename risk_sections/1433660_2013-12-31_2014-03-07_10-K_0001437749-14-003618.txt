ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating our company and our common stock. If any of the risks described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be materially adversely affected. Our financial results are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors that could result in our failing to achieve anticipated financial results. Our quarterly and annual financial results have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, the capital goods industries in which we compete can have significant variations in the number, contractual terms and size of orders. The timing of our receipt of orders and our shipment of the products or provision of services can significantly impact the sales and income of a period. These and any one or more of the factors listed below, among other things, could cause us not to achieve our revenue or profitability expectations and the resulting failure to meet market expectations could cause a drop in our stock price: • changes in demand for our products and services, including changes in growth rates in the food processing and air transportation industries; • downturns in our customers’ businesses resulting from deteriorating domestic and international economies where our customers do substantial business; • changes in commodity prices resulting in increased manufacturing costs, such as petroleum-based products, metals or other raw materials we use in significant quantities; • changes in pricing policies resulting from competitive pressures, such as aggressive price discounting by our competitors and other market factors; • our ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new or enhanced versions of our products and services; • unexpected needs for capital expenditures or other unanticipated expenses; • changes in the mix of revenue attributable to domestic and international sales; • changes in the mix of products and services that we sell; • seasonal fluctuations in buying patterns; and • future acquisitions and divestitures of technologies, products and businesses. Unanticipated delays or acceleration in our sales cycles make accurate estimation of our revenue difficult and could result in significant fluctuation in quarterly operating results. The length of our sales cycle varies depending on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control, including the size and complexity of a potential transaction, the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities and our current and potential customers’ internal budgeting and approval process. As a result of a generally long sales cycle, we may expend significant effort over a long period of time in an attempt to obtain an order, but ultimately not obtain the order, or the order ultimately received may be smaller than anticipated. Our revenue from different customers varies from quarter to quarter, and a customer with a large order in one quarter may generate significantly lower revenue in subsequent quarters. Due to resulting fluctuations, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful, and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance. 16 Deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business. Our business may be adversely affected by changes in current or future national or global economic conditions, including interest rates, availability of capital, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our required raw materials, thereby negatively affecting our financial results. National and global economic conditions could, among other things: • make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain increased financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future; • render our lenders or other financial instrument counterparties unable to honor their commitments or otherwise default under a financing agreement; • impair the financial condition of some of our customers, thereby hindering our customers’ ability to obtain financing to purchase our products and/or increasing customer bad debts; • cause customers to forgo or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing equipment and machinery, and delay or reduce preventative maintenance, thereby reducing our revenue and/or profits; • negatively impact our customers’ ability to raise pricing to counteract increased fuel, labor, and other costs, making it less likely that they will expend resources on JBT AeroTech equipment as they have in the past; • impair the financial condition of some of our suppliers thereby potentially increasing both the likelihood of having to renegotiate supply terms and the risk of non-performance by suppliers; • negatively impact global demand for air transportation services as well as protein food products and processed food products, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows in our JBT AeroTech and JBT FoodTech segments, respectively; • negatively affect the rates of expansion, consolidation, renovation and equipment replacement within the air transportation industry and within the food processing industry, which may affect the performance of our JBT AeroTech and JBT FoodTech segments, respectively; and • impair the financial viability of our insurers. Disruptions in the political, regulatory, economic and social conditions of the foreign countries in which we conduct business could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We operate manufacturing facilities in nine countries other than the United States, and our international sales accounted for a significant portion of our 2013 revenue. Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate or seek to expand our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. These factors include: • nationalization and expropriation; • potentially burdensome taxation; • increased growth in our international business operations and revenue relative to our domestic operations may result in increasing tax liabilities resulting from repatriation of income generated outside of the United States; • continuing economic downturns, inflationary and recessionary markets, including capital and equity markets; • civil unrest, political instability, terrorist attacks and wars; • seizure of assets; • trade restrictions, trade protection measures or price controls; • foreign ownership restrictions; • import or export licensing requirements; • restrictions on operations, trade practices, trade partners and investment decisions resulting from domestic and foreign laws and regulations; • changes in governmental laws and regulations; • inability to repatriate income or capital; and • reductions in the availability of qualified personnel. 17 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, changes in exchange rates will result in increases or decreases in our costs and earnings and may also affect our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in U.S. dollars. Although we may seek to minimize our currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where we deem it appropriate, we cannot be assured that our efforts will be successful. To the extent we sell our systems and services in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our systems and services becoming too expensive for foreign customers. Our inability to obtain raw materials, component parts, and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products. We purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers for use in manufacturing our products. We also purchase certain finished goods from suppliers. Changes in our relationships with suppliers or increases in our costs for raw materials, component parts or finished goods we purchase could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins could decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to customers. New regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as “conflict minerals”, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies that use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These new requirements necessitated due diligence efforts in fiscal 2013, with initial disclosure requirements beginning in May 2014. There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including those incurred to conduct diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement. The increase in energy or raw material prices may reduce the profitability of our customers, which ultimately could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Energy prices remain at historically high levels. These increases had a negative trickledown effect on many areas involved in running a business, straining profitability through increased operating costs. Our customers require large amounts of energy to run their businesses, particularly in the air transportation industry. Energy prices can affect the profitability of passenger and cargo air carriers through increased jet and ground support equipment fuel prices. Energy prices also affect food processors through increased energy and utility costs to run the plant, chemical and petroleum based raw materials used in production and fuel costs to run logistics and service fleet vehicles. Food processors are also dependent upon the cost and supply of raw materials such as feed grains, livestock, produce and dairy products. Recent rises in the cost and limitations in availability of these commodities can negatively affect the profitability of their operations. A reduction in profitability due to increased energy or raw material prices within our customer base may reduce their future investments in food processing equipment or airport equipment. This reduction in investment may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in food consumption patterns due to diet trends or economic conditions may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Dietary trends can create demand for protein food products but negatively impact high-carbohydrate foods, or create demand for easy to prepare, transportable meals but negatively impact traditional canned products. Because various food types and packaging can quickly go in and out of style as a function of health, dietary or convenience trends, food processors can be challenged in forecasting the needed capacity and related equipment and services for their food plants. During periods of economic uncertainty, consumer demand for protein products or processed food products may also be negatively impacted by increases in food prices. Shifting consumer demand for protein products or processed foods may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 18 An outbreak of animal borne diseases (H5N1, BSE or other virus strains affecting poultry or livestock), citrus tree diseases or food borne illnesses or other food safety or quality concerns may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. An outbreak or pandemic stemming from H5N1 (avian flu) or BSE (mad cow disease) or any other animal related disease strains could reduce the availability of poultry or beef that is processed for the restaurant, food service, wholesale or retail consumer. Any limitation on raw material could discourage producers from making additional capital investments in processing equipment, aftermarket products, parts and services. Such a decrease in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The success of our citrus business is directly related to the viability and health of citrus crops. The citrus industries in Florida, Brazil and other countries are facing increased pressure on their harvests and citrus bearing acreage due to citrus canker and greening diseases. These citrus tree diseases are often incurable once a tree has been infested and the end result can be the destruction of the tree. Reduced amounts of available fruit for the processed or fresh markets could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Should an E. coli or other food borne illness cause a recall of meat or produce, the companies supplying those fresh, further processed or canned forms of these products could be severely financially affected. Any negative impact on the financial viability of our customer base of fresh or processed food providers could seriously affect and reduce our immediate and recurring revenue base. Freezes, hurricanes, droughts or other natural disasters may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Should a natural disaster negatively affect the production of growers or farms, the food processing industry may not have the fresh foods necessary to meet consumer demand. The crops of entire groves or fields can be severely impacted by a drought, freeze or hurricane. Should a drought or freeze continue for an extended duration or high category hurricane directly impact a tree crop area, the trees themselves could be permanently damaged. If orchards had to be replanted, the trees may not produce viable product for several years. Since our revenue generation is dependent on a farmer’s ability to provide high quality crops to some of our customers, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. Our failure to comply with the laws and regulations governing our U.S. government contracts or the loss of production funding of any of our U.S. government contracts could harm our business. The federal government is the largest contractor in the United States. Our JBT AeroTech business enters into contracts with the U.S. government, including contracts relating to the sale and logistics support of our Halvorsen Loader, which is a military air cargo loader, to the U.S. Department of Defense. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the U.S. government. The laws governing U.S. government contracts differ in several respects from the laws governing private contracts. They are heavily regulated to curb misappropriation of funds and ensure uniform policies and practices across agencies. Their ongoing funding is tied to National Defense Budgets and Procurement Programs that are annually negotiated and approved or disapproved by the U.S. Department of Defense, Executive Branch and the Congress. For example, if there were any shifts in spending priorities or if funding for the military cargo loader program were reduced or cancelled as a result of the so called sequester or otherwise, the resulting loss of revenue may have a material adverse impact on our JBT AeroTech business. Many U.S. government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Moreover, U.S. defense contracts, in particular, are unilaterally terminable at the option of the U.S. government with compensation for work completed and costs incurred. Contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to special laws and regulations, the noncompliance with which may result in various sanctions. If, for any reason, we were now or at any time in the future found to be non-compliant with any laws or regulations governing U.S. government contracts, our earnings could be negatively impacted. In addition, any delays of deliverables due to our non-performance would also have a negative impact on these contracts. 19 Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any future terrorist attacks against U.S. targets, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the United States or its allies, or military or trade disruptions affecting our customers or the economy as a whole may materially adversely affect our operations or those of our customers. As a result, there could be delays or losses in transportation and deliveries to our customers, decreased sales of our products and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from our customers. Strategic targets such as those relating to transportation and food processing may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the United States. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Due to the type of contracts we enter into, the cumulative loss of several major contracts may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We often enter into large, project-oriented contracts or long-term equipment leases and service agreements. These agreements may be terminated or breached, or our customers may fail to renew these agreements. If we were to lose several key agreements over a relatively short period of time and if we were to fail to develop alternative business opportunities, we could experience a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may lose money on fixed-price contracts. As is customary for several of the business areas in which we operate, we agree, in some cases, to provide products and services under fixed-price contracts. Under these contracts, we are typically responsible for cost overruns. Our actual costs and any gross profit realized on these fixed-price contracts may vary from the estimated amounts on which these contracts were originally based. There is inherent risk in the estimation process, including significant unforeseen technical and logistical challenges or longer than expected lead times. A fixed-price contract may prohibit our ability to mitigate the impact of unanticipated increases in raw material prices (including the price of steel) through increased pricing. Depending on the size of a project, variations from estimated contract performance could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Customer sourcing initiatives may negatively affect new equipment and aftermarket businesses. Integration of the supply chain to provide a sustainable competitive advantage has become an objective for many multi-national companies. With continued price pressure from consumers, wholesalers and retailers, manufacturers are focusing their efforts on ways to reduce costs, improve sourcing processes and enhance profitability. If customers implement sourcing initiatives focused solely on immediate cost savings and not on total cost of ownership, our new equipment and aftermarket sales could be negatively affected. The solutions we sell are very complex, and we need to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new solutions in a global, competitive, demanding and changing environment. Significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were to lose our significant technology advantage, our market share and growth could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to deliver products, features and functionality as projected, we may be unable to meet our commitments to customers, which could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation and business. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by competing technology. Some of our competitors are large multinational companies that may have greater financial resources than us, and they may be able to devote greater resources to research and development of new systems, services and technologies than we are able to do. Moreover, some of our competitors operate in narrow business areas, allowing them to concentrate their research and development efforts directly on products and services for those areas. 20 When we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology, the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability, quality or operability problems. Despite rigorous testing prior to their release and superior quality processes, newly developed or enhanced products and solutions may have some start up issues which may be found after the products are introduced and shipped. The correction and detection of issues may cause delays, lost revenue and incremental costs. Product introductions and certain enhancements of existing products by us in future periods may also reduce demand for our existing products or could delay purchases by customers awaiting arrival of our new products. As new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from older products. If we are unable to develop, preserve and protect our intellectual property assets, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected. We strive to protect and enhance our proprietary intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as through technological safeguards and operating policies. To the extent we are not successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. We may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology without our authorization or from independently developing technology that is similar to ours, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. With respect to our pending patent applications, we may not be successful in securing patents for these claims, and our competitors may already have applied for patents that, once issued, will prevail over our patent rights or otherwise limit our ability to sell our products. Claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have seen a trend towards aggressive enforcement of intellectual property rights as the functionality of products in our industry increasingly overlaps and the volume of issued patents continues to grow. As a result, there is a risk that we could be subject to infringement claims which, regardless of their validity, could: • Be expensive, time consuming and divert management attention away from normal business operations; • Require us to pay monetary damages or enter into non-standard royalty and licensing agreements; • Require us to modify our product sales and development plans; or • Require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers. Regardless of whether these claims have any merit, they can be burdensome to defend or settle and can harm our business and reputation. Our information systems, computer equipment and information databases are critical to our business operations, and any damage or disruptions could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases from damage by, among other things, earthquake, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusions and other catastrophic events. A part of our operations is based in an area of California that has experienced power outages and earthquakes, while another part of our operations is based in an area of Florida that has experienced power outages and hurricanes. Despite our best efforts at planning for such contingencies, catastrophic events of this nature may still result in system failures and other interruptions in our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, it is periodically necessary to replace, upgrade or modify our internal information systems. If we are unable to do this in a timely and cost-effective manner, especially in light of demands on our information technology resources, our ability to capture and process financial transactions and therefore our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely impacted. Loss of our key management and other personnel could impact our business. We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of any of these officers or key personnel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, competition for skilled and non-skilled employees among companies that rely heavily on engineering, technology and manufacturing is intense, and the loss of skilled or non-skilled employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional skilled and non-skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research activities successfully, develop new products and services and meet our customers’ requirements. 21 The industries in which we operate expose us to potential liabilities arising out of the installation or use of our systems that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our businesses supply equipment and systems for use in food processing as well as equipment, systems and services used in airports all over the world, which creates potential exposure for us to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, product liability, commercial claims, property damage, pollution and other environmental damages. Although we have obtained business and related risk insurance, we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover all potential liabilities. Further, we cannot assure you that insurance will generally be available in the future or, if available, that premiums to obtain such insurance will be commercially justifiable. If we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Environmental protection initiatives may negatively impact the profitability of our business. Global initiatives to protect and steward the environment have moved to center stage. From global warming and climate change to urban sprawl and resource depletion, corporations and consumers are becoming more aware and concerned about the impact of human activity on the environment. Comprehensive global and national greenhouse gas reduction programs have been proposed and are being discussed within legislatures, boardrooms and households. The ultimate costs, implementation and success of such broad reaching programs will be dependent on the precise emissions targets, the timing for the reductions and the means of implementation. Pressures to reduce the footprint of carbon emissions impact the air transportation and manufacturing sectors. Airports, airlines and air cargo providers are continually looking for new ways to become more energy efficient and reduce pollutants. Manufacturing plants are seeking means to reduce their heat-trapping emissions and minimize their energy and water usage. All of the initiatives come at a cost both to our customers’ operations as well as to our operating costs and therefore may materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our operations and industries are subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, which can change. We therefore face uncertainties with regard to lawsuits, regulations and other related matters. In the normal course of business, we are subject to proceedings, lawsuits, claims and other matters, including those that relate to the environment, health and safety, employee benefits, export compliance, intellectual property, product liability, tax matters and regulatory compliance. For example, we are subject to changes in foreign laws and regulations that may encourage or require us to hire local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular non-U.S. jurisdiction. In addition, environmental laws and regulations affect the systems and services we design, market and sell, as well as the facilities where we manufacture our systems. We are required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with environmental laws and regulations and anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. There is an increased focus by the SEC and Department of Justice on enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”). Given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect or prevent improper or unlawful conduct by our international partners and employees, despite our ethics, governance and compliance standards, which could put us at risk regarding possible violations of laws, including the FCPA. Unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts we record, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. Our existing financing agreements include restrictive and financial covenants. Certain of our loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under other loan agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 22 Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could affect our results of operations, equity, and pension contributions in future periods. Our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions we use to estimate pension income or expense are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plans assets. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to accumulated other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Estimates – Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report. Although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related, key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to pension plans as required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our corporate governance documents, our rights plan and Delaware law may delay or discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it difficult and expensive for a third-party to pursue a tender offer, change-in-control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our management and Board of Directors. These provisions include, among others: • A Board that is divided into three classes with staggered terms; • Limitations on the right of stockholders to remove directors; • The right of our Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; • Inability of our stockholders to act by written consent; and • Rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors at stockholders meetings. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in this type of transaction may not have an opportunity to do so. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change-in-control or a change in our management or Board and, as a result, may adversely affect the marketability and market price of our common stock. In addition, we have adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us. Under the plan, if any person or group acquires, or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15% or more of our common stock, without approval of our Board under specified circumstances, our other stockholders will have the right to purchase shares of our common stock, or shares of the acquiring company, at a substantial discount to the public market price. Therefore, the rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board, except pursuant to any offer conditioned on a substantial number of rights being acquired. Although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. 23 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
