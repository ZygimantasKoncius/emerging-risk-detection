risk factors, measuring genetic risk is in deCODE's view a critical component for the realization of personalized medicine. By providing a more complete understanding of individual risk, such tests can empower better prevention in those conditions in which known lifestyle and environmental risk can be modified, as well as targeted screening and early intervention in diseases such as cancer. The value of deCODE's drug discovery and development programs is derived from its integrated capabilities in structure-based drug design and medicinal chemistry. Through its structural biology and chemistry units based in the United States, deCODE can develop new and detailed understanding of the structure and binding sites of drug targets. This makes it possible to discover compounds that may have superior safety and tolerability profiles than existing drugs. deCODE has fully integrated capabilities ranging from targeted in vitro and model organism biology through cGMP manufacturing for clinical trials. Going Concern: The financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. deCODE has recorded substantial operating and net losses over the past three years. Its cash flows used in operations have been $54,779,000, $63,889,000 and $85,169,000 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, the Company has significant amounts of long-term debt which requires interest payments of approximately $8,050,000 per annum. At December 31, 2008, deCODE had liquid funds available for operating activities (cash and cash equivalents) of $3,701,000 as compared to $64,175,000 (cash and cash equivalents together with current investments) at December 31, 2007. In January 2009 deCODE entered into an agreement with an Icelandic financial institution (NBI hf) pursuant to which NBI has purchased all auction rate securities ("ARS") owned by deCODE for an aggregate price of approximately $11.0 million (see Note 22). deCODE's planned operations require 67 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) immediate additional liquidity substantially in excess of the amounts noted above, raising substantial doubt about deCODE's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's Plans: To address deCODE's immediate need for funds, management and the Board of Directors are exploring the possibilities of (i) selling some or all of deCODE's U.S, subsidiaries and/or its diagnostics and deCODEme businesses based in Iceland, (ii) granting licenses to specific diagnostic products, (iii) entering into a collaboration for gene sequencing, (iv) selling some or all of deCODE's clinical and pre-clinical drug discovery programs, (v) restructuring deCODE's outstanding convertible notes, and (vi) obtaining new equity financing. Closing on opportunities in (ii) and (vi) could provide cash flow to meet immediate needs. Achieving (v) could result in either a cash settlement of deCODE's convertible note obligation for substantially less than the carrying amount or in a conversion of the convertible notes into equity of deCODE. Receipt of additional equity financing to support operations in the longer term depends in large part on the outcomes of actions in (ii), (iii) and (v). Management and the board are having ongoing dialogues and negotiations with third parties in each of these areas. If deCODE's Board of Directors concludes that any of these options can be better implemented in a bankruptcy proceeding, deCODE will commence a proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Whether in a bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, the consummation of any of these approaches are dependent on successful negotiations with third parties and in many cases the availability of financing to such third parties. There can be no assurance that any potential transactions will be consummated or will result in sufficient funding to sustain operations. If deCODE is unable to raise additional capital through one or more of these options, it may be forced to liquidate its remaining assets and discontinue as a business. 2. Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation These financial statements are reported in United States dollars, deCODE's functional currency, and prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Tabular amounts are stated in thousands, except per share amounts. As discussed more fully in Note 1, deCODE does not have adequate cash flows from operations or, currently, access to sufficient available capital to meet its requirements for its 2009 operations. These factors raise significant uncertainty about deCODE's ability to continue as a going concern. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability or classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts or classification of liabilities should deCODE be unable to continue as a going concern. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of deCODE genetics, Inc. and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that 68 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis deCODE evaluates its estimates, which include, among others, those related to collaborative arrangements, property and equipment, income taxes, litigation and other contingencies, materials and supplies valuation, derivatives, goodwill and intangible assets, investments and bad debts. deCODE bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form its basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Uncertainties deCODE is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, development by deCODE or its competitors of new technological innovations, ability to market products or services, dependence on key personnel, dependence on key suppliers and many of deCODE's materials and supplies, protection of proprietary technology, ability to obtain additional financing, ability to negotiate collaborative arrangements, and compliance with governmental and other regulations. Concentration of Risk At December 31, 2008, deCODE has no significant off-balance sheet concentrations of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. Financial instruments that potentially subject deCODE to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments made primarily in auction rate securities ("ARS"), money market funds, government and non-government debt securities and receivables. These instruments are subject to risk of default, changes in credit rating and changes in market value. Investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. deCODE's cash and cash equivalents are deposited with financial institutions having a high credit rating (A-/A3 or better in the United States and the United Kingdom and Baa1 in Iceland). In Iceland the financial institutions are owned by the Government of Iceland and the credit rating of the government applies to the financial institutions at the end of 2008 as they are not separately rated. At December 31, 2008, deCODE had $1,124,000 of cash and cash equivalents held in Icelandic financial institutions. Deposits with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, 20% and 13%, respectively, of consolidated receivables were due from U.S. Government agencies. Fair Value of Short-Term Financial Instruments The fair value of short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, certain other current assets, trade accounts payable, certain accrued liabilities, and other current liabilities approximates their carrying amount in the financial statements due mainly to the short maturity of such instruments. Based on borrowing rates currently available to deCODE for capital lease obligations with similar terms, the carrying value of such of its debt obligations approximates fair value. 69 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Cash and Cash Equivalents Highly liquid investments with a maturity of ninety days or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Investments deCODE invests its excess cash balances in marketable securities. deCODE classifies all of its investments as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale investments are reported at fair value as of each balance sheet date and any unrealized gains and losses are reported in stockholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses are reported in Other non-operating income and (expense), net. If any adjustment to fair value reflecting a decline in the value of the investment is determined to be "other-than-temporary", the investment is marked to market through a charge to the consolidated statements of operations and reported in Other non-operating income and (expense), net. This includes losses due to changes in credit quality or interest rates judged to be other-than-temporary, including changes resulting from the disruption in the capital markets during 2008 and 2007. Fair value is generally determined with reference to quotations in active markets when available and, if not available, a valuation is performed. Valuation of available-for-sale securities for purposes of determining the amount of gains and losses is based on the specific identification method. Premiums and discounts associated with investments in bonds are amortized using the effective interest rate method. Classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is dependent upon management's intended holding period, the securities maturity date and liquidity considerations based on market conditions. If management intends to hold the securities for longer than one year or believes, based on circumstances, that the security may not be available for use in current operations, as of the balance sheet date, they are classified as non-current (see Note 7). Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies, included in deCODE's other current assets, are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. deCODE evaluates materials and supplies levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records write-downs of value for obsolescence as required. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, materials and supplies were valued at $2,206,000 and $3,258,000, respectively. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, deCODE used materials and supplies for which it had made provisions for in prior years as slow-moving, excess and obsolete, benefiting otherwise reported research and development expenses by $115,000, $148,000 and $837,000, respectively. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets of generally three to four years for laboratory equipment, five years for furniture and fixtures, and three to five years for other equipment. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, while major betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the statement of operations. 70 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Capital Leases Assets held under capital lease agreements are initially recorded at the lower of the fair market value of the related asset or the present value of the future minimum rental payments using interest rates appropriate at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment subject to capital lease agreements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset unless the lease transfers ownership or contains a bargain purchase option, in which case the leased asset is amortized over the estimated useful life of such asset. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill deCODE periodically reviews long-lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held for use is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. In estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. If any such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its fair value. deCODE reviews goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of the goodwill impairment tests, deCODE identifies its reporting units, identifies the assets and liabilities of the reporting units and performs impairment tests on the goodwill associated with them. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. To identify potential impairments deCODE compares fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. For this purpose, deCODE estimates fair value of a reporting unit using analyses of comparable companies and recent comparable transactions. Finance Costs Related to Long-Term Debt Costs associated with obtaining long-term debt are deferred and amortized as interest expense over the term of the debt. Remaining unamortized deferred financing costs included in long-term assets were $4,832,000 and $6,454,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Revenue Recognition deCODE records revenue provided that there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, the price is fixed and determinable, services were rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured. deCODE has entered into research, development and commercialization alliances and collaborations with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The key components of the commercial terms of such alliance arrangements typically include one or more of the following: research funding; up-front, exclusivity, technology access, and technology development fees; milestone payments; license or commercialization fees; and royalties or profit sharing from the commercialization of products. deCODE's revenues from research and development collaboration agreements are recorded and recognized in accordance with the applicable performance requirements and terms of the respective contracts, generally either (i) as contract research costs are incurred, usually ratably over the period of effort, (ii) according to the level of efforts expended based on the ratio of contract research costs 71 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) incurred to expected total costs, or (iii) upon the achievement of substantive milestones. deCODE's accounting recognition policies with respect to each significant element of deCODE's revenue is summarized as follows: Genomic services, research funding and other service fees. Genomic services revenue is generally recognized upon completion. Research funding is recognized as earned, typically ratably over the period of effort. Funding payments are not refundable in the event that the related efforts are not successful. Other service revenues from negotiated rate contracts are recognized based upon the terms of the underlying contract generally either (i) on a per diem basis as services are rendered; (ii) on the basis of efforts expended, generally upon the ratio of costs incurred to total expected costs of providing the service; or (iii) upon completion of the service rendered. Any losses on contracts are provided for when they are determinable. Included in revenue are billings to customers for the cost of materials purchased by deCODE. Milestone payments. Under the substantive milestone method deCODE records revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and deCODE recognizes revenue when acknowledgement of achievement of applicable performance requirements is received from the collaborator. Milestone payments without the above characteristics are recognized on a retrospective basis over the contractual term of the underlying agreement. In arrangements with multiple elements, if the milestone is substantive in nature and there is uncertainty in the achievement of the milestone and there is no further obligation on the part of deCODE, deCODE records revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and deCODE recognizes revenue when acknowledgement of achievement of applicable performance requirements is received from the collaborator ("Milestone Payment Method"). If the milestone is earned and there is further obligation under the contract for performance by deCODE, then deCODE will record revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and deCODE retroactively recognizes revenue through the current period based on the total contractual term and amortizes the balance over the remaining contractual term. Up-front, exclusivity, technology access, and technology development fees. deCODE recognizes revenue from non-refundable fees not specifically tied to a separate earnings process ratably over the expected customer relationship period or estimated period of performance. Changes in estimates could impact revenue in the period the estimate is changed. If deCODE's estimate of the period of performance shortens or lengthens, the amount of revenue we recognized from such non-refundable fees not specifically tied to a separate earnings process could increase or decrease in the period the change in estimate becomes known; future related revenues would be adjusted accordingly. Grant Revenue. Research grants and contracts that provide for payments to deCODE for work performed are recognized as revenue when the related expense is incurred and deCODE has obtained necessary governmental approval to use the grant funds for these expenses. Revenues under these contracts will be recognized as deCODE incurs costs related to the contracts. Deferred Revenue. In general, prerequisites for billings are established by contractual terms including predetermined payment schedules, the achievement of contract milestones, or submission of appropriate billing detail. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed in accordance with contract 72 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) terms but not yet recognized according to deCODE's accounting policy. Unbilled costs and fees arise when revenue has been recognized but customers have not been billed. Cost of Revenue deCODE's cost of revenue is comprised of costs of services provided to customers and collaborators, including the entirety of costs incurred in connection with programs that have been partnered and on which deCODE receives research funding. At times, deCODE may dedicate additional resources and incur costs in addition to costs covered by research funding received in such collaborative programs. Major components of deCODE's cost of revenue include personnel costs, namely salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; materials and supplies; services contracted for research activities; other third party fees and costs; depreciation of property and equipment; amortization of patents and other intangible assets; and items of overhead, including allocations of various administrative and facilities related costs. Research and Development Expenses All costs associated with internal research and development and research and development services, including pre-clinical and clinical trial studies, which deCODE has externally contracted are expensed as incurred. Patent Costs Patent application costs are charged to legal expense as incurred and classified in selling, general and administrative expense. Stock-Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, deCODE adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R"), which requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors over the performance period which is typically the vesting term. deCODE adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, deCODE's Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS 123R. deCODE elected to use the short-cut method for determining the historical pool of windfall tax benefits in accordance with FASB Staff Position SFAS 123R-3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards and the tax law ordering approach for purposes of determining whether an excess tax benefit has been realized. Foreign Currency Translation deCODE's functional currency is the U.S. dollar. One of its smaller subsidiaries in Iceland uses the local currency, the Icelandic krona, as the functional currency. For this entity, the assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Gains and losses from translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reported according to the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date and are included in the consolidated statements of operations 73 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) classified as Other non-operating income and (expense), net. Net transaction and translation gains (losses) recorded were ($280,000), $690,000 and $114,000 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Income Taxes deCODE accounts for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of deCODE's assets and liabilities and for tax loss carryforwards at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is applied against any deferred tax asset if, based on the weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. deCODE accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition, interest and penalties, and disclosure. deCODE recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Computation of Net Loss per Share Basic net loss per share is computed using net loss available to common stockholders and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period is the number of shares determined by relating the portion of time within a reporting period that common shares have been outstanding to the total time in that period. Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of potential common shares. Diluted net loss per share does not differ from basic net loss per share in all periods presented as potential common shares are antidilutive for all such periods and are, therefore, excluded from the calculation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2008, deCODE implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurement, (SFAS 157), for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. In accordance with the provisions of FSP FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, deCODE deferred the implementation of SFAS 157 as it relates to its non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until January 1, 2009. deCODE is evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements. On December 12, 2007, EITF 07-01, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements Related to the Development and Commercialization of Intellectual Property, (EITF 07-01), was issued. EITF- 07-01 prescribes the accounting for collaborations. It requires certain transactions between collaborators to be recorded in the income statement on either a gross or net basis within expenses when certain characteristics exist in the collaboration relationship. EITF 07-01 is effective for all of deCODE's 74 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) collaborations existing on January 1, 2009 and for all subsequent collaborations. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on deCODE's financial statements or results of operations. On December 4, 2007, SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, (SFAS 141(R)), was issued. This Standard will require an acquiring company to measure all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent considerations and all contractual contingencies, at fair value as of the acquisition date. In addition, an acquiring company is required to capitalize IPR&D and either amortize it over the life of the product, or write it off if the project is abandoned or impaired. The Standard is effective for transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2009. deCODE has not determined the effect that the adoption of SFAS 141(R) will have on its consolidated financial statements, but the effect will generally be limited to future acquisitions in 2009, except for certain tax treatment of previous acquisitions. SFAS 141(R) amended FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109), and FIN 48. Previously, SFAS 109 and FIN 48, respectively, generally required post-acquisitions adjustments to business combination related deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions to be recorded as an increase or decrease to goodwill. SFAS 141(R) does not permit this accounting and generally will require any such changes to be recorded in current period income tax expense. Thus, after SFAS 141(R) is adopted, all changes to valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions established in acquisition accounting (whether the combination was accounted for under SFAS 141 or SFAS 141(R)) must be recognized in current period income tax expense. On December 4, 2007, SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51, (SFAS 160), was issued. This Standard changes the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling or minority interests (now called noncontrolling interest) in consolidated financial statements. This Standard is effective January 1, 2009. When implemented, prior periods will be recast for the changes required by SFAS 160. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on deCODE's financial statements and results of operations. On March 19, 2008, SFAS No. 161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (SFAS 161), was issued. This Standard enhances the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. This Standard is effective January 1, 2009. Since SFAS No. 161 requires only additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging activities, adoption of SFAS No. 161 will not affect deCODE's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 75 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 3. Revenue Significant elements of deCODE's revenue are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Genomic services $ 23,613 $ 5,753 $ 2,471 Research funding and other service fees 15,390 16,930 16,248 Government research contracts and grant funding 16,880 14,538 16,922 Milestone payments and other 2,212 3,182 4,869 Total revenue $ 58,095 $ 40,403 $ 40,510 The following table represents revenue generated by geographic area: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) United States $ 20,960 $ 19,753 $ 16,816 Iceland 37,135 20,650 23,694 $ 58,095 $ 40,403 $ 40,510 During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, deCODE performed services totaling $163,000 and $246,000, respectively, for employers of members of deCODE's Board of Directors. During the year ended December 31, 2008 deCODE purchased services totaling $258,000 from employers of members of deCODE's Board of Directors. Significant collaborative agreements, contracts and grants are as follows: F. Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche) Therapeutics. In November 2004, we signed a three-year agreement with Roche to co-develop inhibitors of PDE4 for the prevention and treatment of vascular disease, including stroke. This agreement continued work advanced under a 2002 agreement, and focused on optimizing lead compounds identified under the previous agreement and beginning clinical development. During the term of the agreement we received $6.0 million of research funding. We will share drug discovery and clinical trials costs under this agreement, and we may receive milestone payments and royalties based on drug sales. Diagnostics. In June 2001, we signed a five-year alliance with Roche's diagnostics division and through June 2006 we collaborated to develop and market DNA-based diagnostics for major diseases. During the term of the alliance, which has now expired, we received $44,250,000 in research funding, up-front fees and milestone payments under the agreement and we may receive additional milestone payments upon the achievement of research and development milestones by Roche and royalties on the sales of diagnostic products developed by Roche. Revenues from these alliances with Roche amounted to $0, $2,000,000 and $6,722,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Costs incurred with these collaborative 76 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) programs with Roche amounted to $0, $0 and $6,437,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, Roche represented 0%, 5% and 17%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. Merck & Co, Inc. (Merck) Obesity. In September 2002, deCODE entered into a three year alliance with Merck aimed at developing new treatments for obesity. Under the alliance, deCODE was to combine research efforts with Merck in the genetics of obesity to identify, validate and prioritize a series of drug targets to take into development. During the three-year research program, which has now expired, deCODE had received research funding, technology access fees and milestone payments in the aggregate amount of $27.3 million. Subject to Merck's developing products based on collaboration discoveries, deCODE may also receive development milestones and royalties. deCODE has discovered three genes linked to obesity under this alliance, and Merck has generated a lead series of compounds against one of the targets deCODE validated through deCODE's genetics research. Revenues from this alliance with Merck amounted $0, $1,000,000 and $1,000,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Costs incurred in connection with this alliance with Merck amounted to $0 for each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Information-Rich Clinical Trials. In February 2004, deCODE entered into an agreement with Merck which provides that deCODE will conduct information-rich clinical trials on a range of Merck's developmental compounds that Merck selects for inclusion in the program. The term of the alliance is seven years, subject to termination by Merck after five years. deCODE will receive royalties on sales of drugs and diagnostics developed as part of the alliance, will receive milestone payments as compounds or pharmacogenomic tests reach the market, will receive research funding for the clinical development of compounds and pharmacogenomic analysis, and received a one-time technology access fee of $10,000,000. A contingency clause on the technology access fee provides that if deCODE rejects the first two non-exclusive development compounds that Merck presents to the collaboration, then Merck has the right to request a refund of $2,500,000 of the technology access fee. The remaining amount of the technology access fee is non-refundable. To date, Merck has not selected any compounds for development under the agreement. There were no revenue or costs of revenue associated with this alliance for years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 or 2006. Grant Funding deCODE has received various research grants from divisions of the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Commission of the European Communities (EC) and private foundations. Research grants for multiple years are based on approved budgets with budgeted amounts subject to approval on an annual basis. NIH grants generally provide for 100% reimbursement of allowable expenditures while the grant under the EC generally provides for fifty percent reimbursement 77 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) of allowable research and development related expenditures. deCODE's significant research grants include: National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). In September 2004, deCODE was awarded a five-year $23,900,000 contract by the NIAID, a division of NIH. Under the contract, deCODE is applying its population approach and resources to discover genetic factors associated with susceptibility to certain infectious diseases and with responsiveness to vaccines targeting such diseases. Revenues from this contract with NIAID amounted to $5,581,000, $3,807,000 and $5,566,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, divisions of the NIH represented 22%, 22% and 33%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the EC represented 7%, 14% and 8%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. 4. Cost of Revenue deCODE's cost of revenue consists of the costs of services provided to customers and collaborators and the costs of programs under research contracts and grants, including: (i) the entirety of the costs incurred in connection with programs that have been partnered and on which deCODE receives research funding; (ii) costs associated with other service fee revenues; and (iii) the total amount of those costs incurred in connection with discovery and development work performed under research contracts and grants. Significant elements of deCODE's revenue and cost of revenue are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 Revenue Cost of Revenue Net (In thousands) Genomic services, research funding and other service $ 41,215 $ 31,121 $ 10,094 Government research contracts and grant funding 16,880 21,396 (4,516 ) Total $ 58,095 $ 52,517 $ 5,578 Year Ended December 31, 2007 Revenue Cost of Revenue Net (In thousands) Genomic services, research funding and other service $ 25,865 $ 27,582 $ (1,717 ) Government research contracts and grant funding 14,538 19,436 (4,898 ) Total $ 40,403 $ 47,018 $ (6,615 ) 78 deCODE genetics, Inc.

Research and Development deCODE's research and development expenses consist of the costs of its own proprietary programs comprised as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Salaries and other personnel costs $ 12,859 $ 18,889 $ 20,440 Materials and supplies 5,583 12,371 7,495 Contractor services and other third party costs 5,038 12,961 19,109 Overhead expenses 3,630 5,510 5,107 Depreciation and amortization 2,482 2,264 3,287 Stock-based compensation 1,134 1,830 1,670 $ 30,726 $ 53,825 $ 57,108 In November 2003, deCODE acquired an exclusive worldwide license from Bayer HealthCare AG (Bayer) to develop and commercialize a small molecule compound (now known as DG031) that is active against a key target, located within an inflammatory pathway, made by a gene isolated at deCODE that predisposes to myocardial infarction, or heart attack. deCODE is obligated to make development milestone payments to Bayer as the compound advances towards market approval and will make royalty payments to Bayer based upon sales of the compound as a marketed drug. In May 2006, deCODE entered into a strategic alliance with Illumina, Inc. ("Illumina") to develop and commercialize molecular diagnostic products. Under the terms of the agreement, deCODE and Illumina will share development costs equally and split operating profits from the sale of diagnostic tests. 79 deCODE genetics, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) There were no unrealized gains and losses at December 31, 2008 and there were $3,000 and $914,000, respectively, at December 31, 2007. December 31, 2008 (In thousands) Contractual maturity of investments: Maturing after 10 years $ 10,311 No maturity date (perpetual) 2,410 $ 12,721 At December 31, 2008, deCODE held investments in Auction Rate Securities ("ARS") with original purchase principal values totaling $33,500,000, which are classified as non-current investments on the balance sheet. The investments in ARS held by deCODE are private placement securities with long-term nominal maturities for which the interest rates are reset through a Dutch auction process at pre-determined calendar intervals, generally each month. This mechanism generally allows existing investors to rollover their holdings and continue to own their respective securities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value. deCODE generally invested in these securities for short periods of time as part of its cash management program. However, the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented deCODE from liquidating holdings of its remaining ARS in recent auctions because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders resulting in multiple failed auctions. deCODE's investments in ARS represent interests in debt obligations, namely life insurance wrapped issues, of companies offering credit derivatives, and of entities on which monoline insurers retain capital put rights. Consistent with deCODE's investment policy guidelines, all of the ARS investments were rated as investment grade (at least A or better) at the time of purchase. The estimated market value of deCODE's non current investments in ARS at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $12,721,000 and $24,833,000, respectively, which reflects a $20,779,000 and $8,667,000 adjustment, respectively, to the principal value of $33,500,000. Although the ARS continue to pay interest according to their stated terms, based on valuation models and an analysis of other-than-temporary impairment factors, deCODE has recorded an impairment charge of $12,112,000 and $7,752,000 in Other non-operating income and (expense), net in the Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, reflecting the portion of ARS holdings that deCODE has concluded have an other-than-temporary decline in value. At December 31, 2007 deCODE had recognized an unrealized loss of $914,000 for those ARS for which the loss was previously believed to be temporary but determined to be other-than-temporary in 2008. In January 2009 deCODE entered into an agreement to sell the ARS, which was accounted for as a secured borrowing, see Note 22, Subsequent Events, for further details. 81 deCODE genetics, Inc.

Property and equipment also includes amounts for certain fixed assets financed under capital lease or finance obligations. The net book value of all of deCODE's property and equipment subject to capital lease and finance obligations was $16,177,000 and $19,953,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. deCODE's capital lease obligations are collateralized by the assets to which the obligations relate. Long-lived assets located in the United States and Iceland were $22,298,000 and $16,883,000, respectively, at December 31, 2008 and $23,452,000 and $20,227,000, respectively, at December 31, 2007. 9. Acquisition of UVS On January 17, 2006, deCODE acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Urdur Verandi Skuld ehf. ("UVS"), a privately-held cancer research firm, from Iceland Genomics Corporation, Inc. ("IGC"), both companies having their principal offices in Reykjavik, Iceland. To acquire UVS, deCODE paid $6,137,000 including 635,006 shares of deCODE common stock valued at $6,082,000 (based upon the average closing price of deCODE common stock two days before and after the acquisition date) and approximately $55,000 for acquisition related costs. As part of the transaction, deCODE acquired research rights for blood and tissue samples and clinical data for various types of cancers which deCODE has added to its samples for research and development purposes. deCODE has included the results of operations of the acquired entity in deCODE's consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition. Because the activity from the beginning of the period to the acquisition date was not material, no pro-forma information is presented. 82 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) The purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities as follows (amounts in thousands): Cash $ 1,270 Net liabilities acquired (719 ) Goodwill 1,191 Identifiable intangible assets 4,395 $ 6,137 The purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired amounted to $1,191,000, which was allocated to goodwill. Under Icelandic tax law goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of the exclusive rights to perform research on blood and tissue samples and related clinical data which were valued at $4,395,000 and will be amortized over a period of 15 years, the estimated useful life of the assets. 10.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Intangible Assets Aggregate amortization expense was $363,000, $568,000 and $1,340,000, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These amounts were included in research and development expenses for all periods presented. As of December 31, 2008 estimated future amortization expense is as follows: 2009 $ 338 2010 331 2011 331 2012 301 2013 293 Thereafter 2,051 Total $ 3,645 Goodwill deCODE's goodwill resulted from the acquisitions of MediChem in 2002 and UVS in 2006. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of September 30 and whenever changes in the circumstances indicate goodwill could be impaired. deCODE completed its annual goodwill impairment tests as of September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006 and no impairments resulted. During the fourth quarter of 2008, deCODE experienced further declines in the market value of its common stock and a further increased stockholder's deficit. These factors, along with global economic conditions, were determined to be a triggering event under SFAS 142 and accordingly an interim impairment test was performed as of December 31, 2008. As a result of this interim test, deCODE determined that it passed step one of the goodwill impairment test prescribed by SFAS 142. Because the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value there was no need to perform the second step of the impairment test and there was no impairment recognized as of December 31, 2008. 11.

The 2004 Notes are convertible into shares of deCODE common stock, at the option of the holder, at a price of $14.00 per share (fair market value of $10.60 on date of issuance), which is equivalent to an initial conversion rate of approximately 71.4286 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes. deCODE may redeem the 2004 Notes beginning April 20, 2009. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15. From this offering, deCODE received net proceeds of $143,805,000. deCODE recorded deferred offering costs of $6,195,000 which are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2004 Notes (through April 15, 2011). During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, interest expense of $887,000, $897,000 and $885,000 was recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the deferred offering cost amortization. Deferred financing costs related to the 2004 Notes is included in other long-term assets and totaled $2,020,000 and $2,907,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007. During each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, interest expense, related to the 3.5% annual interest, of $5,250,000 was recorded to other non-operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In November 2006 deCODE completed the sale of $80,000,000 principal amount of 3.5% Senior Convertible Notes due 2011 (the "2006 Notes") at a price of 70% of par pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The 2006 Notes have substantially similar terms to the 2004 Notes. The 2006 Notes are convertible into shares of deCODE common stock, at the option of the holder, at a price of $14.00 per share, which is equivalent to an initial conversion rate of approximately 71.4286 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes. deCODE may redeem the 2006 Notes beginning April 20, 2009. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15. From the 2006 Notes 85 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) offering, deCODE received gross proceeds of $56,000,000. The 30% ($24,000,000) discount on the 2006 Notes was recorded as a reduction to the debt recorded and deCODE will accrete this discount, over the life of the 2006 Notes (through April 15, 2011), to interest expense up to the full principal amount of $80,000,000. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, deCODE recognized interest expense related to the accretion of the discount of $5,029,000, $4,662,000 and $264,000, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, with a remaining discount to be accreted of $14,045,000 at December 31, 2008. deCODE recorded deferred offering costs of $3,053,000 which are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2006 Notes. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, interest expense related to deferred cost amortization of $647,000, $588,000 and $34,000, respectively, was recorded to other non-operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations with a remaining balance of $1,806,000 and $2,453,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, interest expense, related to the 3.5% annual interest, of $2,800,000, $2,800,000 and $583,000, respectively, was recorded to other non-operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The existence of the substantial discount on the 2006 Notes causes one of the features, a put option by the holder upon a change of control of deCODE, to be accounted for separately as an embedded derivative. deCODE has assessed the probability of a change in control at December 31, 2008 and 2007 to be remote and accordingly, the value assigned to the derivative is immaterial. The fair value of the 3.5% convertible notes at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $25,744,000 and $153,768,000, respectively. The fair value of the convertible notes was based on the quoted market prices at December 31, 2008 and 2007. Mortgage Loan deCODE had a mortgage loan with a financial institution for its Woodridge, IL facility with a balance of $5,611,000 at December 31, 2006. The mortgage carried an interest rate of three-month LIBOR + 2.25% (7.62% at December 31, 2006), payable in monthly installments of $26,000 plus interest for two years with a final payment of $4,990,000 originally due in December 2008. During 2007, in conjunction with the sale and leaseback of the Woodridge facility (see Note 14) this loan was repaid. Equipment Notes The equipment notes consist of various loans for equipment, range in principal amount from $288,000 to $601,000 and are collateralized by the related equipment. The notes are generally payable over a term of 4 years, mature at various dates through May 2010, and have interest rates ranging from 10.27% to 10.95%. The fair values of equipment notes at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $334,000 and $565,000, respectively, as estimated based on quoted market rates for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities. Short Term Borrowings In July 2008, 2007 and 2006, deCODE entered into one-year agreements to finance its Directors and Officers insurance premium in the amounts of $441,000, $561,000 and $600,000, respectively. The amounts are payable monthly with interest at 3.42%, 5.99% and 6.25% for the 2008, 2007 and 2006 agreements, respectively. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, $242,000, $310,000 and $331,000 was 86 deCODE genetics, Inc.

Fair Value Measurement On September 6, 2006, Statement of Financial Standard No. 157 Fair Value Measurement, ("SFAS 157"), was issued. This Standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This standard is effective January 1, 2008 for deCODE. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Position, ("FSP") No. 157-2, Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement 157, ("FSP No. 157-2"), which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financials statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. deCODE adopted SFAS 157 as of January 1, 2008, with the exception of the application of the statement to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. The adoption of FAS 157 did not have a material impact on deCODE's consolidated financial statements. deCODE is evaluating the impact on the non-financial assets and liabilities. Valuation Hierarchy. SFAS 157 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2008 Using: Total Carrying Value at December 31, 2008 Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (In thousands) Auction rate securities (investments non-current) $ 12,721   $ 12,721 87 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) The following table presents deCODE's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) at December 31, 2008: Auction Rate Securities Year Ended December 31, 2008 Balance at beginning of period $ 24,833 Transfers to Level 3  Total gains (losses): Included in earnings (13,026 ) Included in other comprehensive income 914 Purchase and settlements (net)  Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 12,721 Valuation Techniques. deCODE's investments in auction rate securities at December 31, 2008 did not have quoted market prices and are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The valuation models used to value the ARS include those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values, including assessments of counterparty credit quality, default risk underlying the security, discount rates and overall capital market liquidity. The valuation of deCODE's investments in ARS is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that may impact the valuation include changes in credit ratings of the securities or their guarantors, underlying collateral value, discounts rates, counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity. Effective January 1, 2008, deCODE adopted, on a prospective basis, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective of the guidance is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. deCODE has not elected the fair value option for any financial instruments and therefore the adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material impact on deCODE's consolidated financial statements. 14. Sale-Leaseback Financings Woodridge In June 2007, deCODE completed a sale and leaseback of its property (land and building) in Woodridge, Illinois. Pursuant to the agreement, deCODE sold the Woodridge property for $25,000,000 in cash and leased the property back under a 17 year lease at an initial rent of $163,000 per month, subject to annual rent increases of 2.5%. Under the lease, deCODE has two 5-year renewal options with rent at the then prevailing market rate. The lease is an absolute net lease and deCODE will continue to pay all expenses relating to the property, including taxes, utilities, insurance and maintenance. deCODE's obligations under the lease are collateralized by a letter of credit in an initial amount of $5,000,000, that may be reduced upon certain conditions. The letter of credit is collateralized by cash equivalents held in a restricted account ($5,500,000) at December 31, 2008. 88 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) The sale and leaseback of the Woodridge property is being accounted for as a financing, as such, the property remains on the balance sheet and continues to be depreciated through the lease term. Proceeds on the sale have been recorded on the balance sheet as a finance obligation and a portion of the rental payments under the lease will be applied, using the effective interest method, to reduce the finance obligation over the term of the lease, with the remainder of the rental payments being recorded as interest expense. Transaction costs amounting to $1,183,000 have been deferred and included in other long term assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the lease, using the effective interest method. Concurrent with the sale and leaseback of Woodridge, deCODE paid the existing mortgage loan ($5,430,000) which had been collateralized by the Woodridge property (see Note 12). Equipment In September 2007, deCODE entered into a financing for the sale and leaseback of equipment. The sale price of the equipment was $2,110,000 and the resulting gain of $305,000 has been deferred and is being recognized over the 24-month term of the leaseback. During 2006, deCODE entered into a financing for the sale and leaseback of laboratory equipment from Illumina for $4,071,000. The net sale price of the equipment was $4,325,000 and the resulting gain of $254,000 has been deferred and is being recognized in earnings over the 37 month term of the leaseback. Also, during 2006, deCODE sold certain laboratory equipment for $713,000 net cash proceeds and leased the equipment back. The resulting gain of $82,000 has been deferred and is being recognized in earnings over the 37 month term of the leaseback. 15. Sale of Encode On July 1, 2008, deCODE sold its subsidiary Encode ehf ("Encode") located in Iceland to a related party (an employee) for a nominal amount (100,000 ISK or $1,000 at December 31, 2008), recognizing a loss on the sale of $102,000 during the year ended December 31, 2008. Management believes the sale price approximated the fair value of Encode. The sale of Encode included the remainder of existing contracts at the date of the sale, immaterial assets and all employees associated with Encode. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, Encode had revenues of $464,000, $680,000 and $448,000, respectively, and operating expenses of $1,562,000, $2,924,000 and $3,256,000, respectively. 16. Commitments and Contingencies Leases and Finance Obligation deCODE leases certain property, equipment and other assets under non-cancelable leases that expire at varying dates through 2024. In June 2007, deCODE sold and leased back its facility in Woodridge, Illinois. This sale and leaseback was accounted for as a financing due to continuing involvement in the form of a collateralized letter of credit. 89 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) At December 31, 2008, future minimum lease payments under all non-cancelable leases are as follows: Operating Leases Capital Leases Finance Obligation (in thousands) 2009 $ 3,872 $ 2,244 $ 2,034 2010 3,739  2,085 2011 3,716  2,137 2012 3,716  2,191 2013 3,526  2,246 Thereafter 22,114  27,045 Total minimum payments $ 40,683 2,244 37,738 Less amount representing interest 42 13,593 Present value of future minimum payments 2,202 24,145 Less: current portion 2,202 648 Long-term portion $  $ 23,497 Total rent expense for operating leases was $3,307,000, $3,850,000 and $3,452,000 in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 the amount reflects the amortization of the deferred gain on sale-leaseback of properties of $1,938,000 per year. Other Commitments Under the terms of certain technology licensing agreements, deCODE is obligated to make payments upon the achievement of established milestones leading to the discovery of defined products. These payments could total $5,000,000, with the timing of payments not determinable at the current time. deCODE's obligations under the Woodridge sale-leaseback are collateralized by a letter of credit in an initial amount of $5,000,000, that may be reduced upon certain conditions. The letter of credit is collateralized by cash equivalents held in a restricted account ($5,500,000) at December 31, 2008). In the event of a change in control, deCODE's Change in Control Benefits Plan (adopted November 2007) requires deCODE to make a lump sum payment to the CEO and reporting officers based on their most recent salary and bonus history. Also, the Plan requires other benefits to be paid, to include life, disability, accident and health insurance for these employees for a period of 24 to 36 months depending on employment. deCODE believes that the probability of these circumstances transpiring is remote, as such no charge has been recognized in its Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2008, the potential minimum lump sum payment (salary and bonus amounts only) under these change in control provisions would have totaled approximately $6,081,000. Guarantees When as part of an acquisition deCODE acquires all of the stock or all of the assets and liabilities of a company, it assumes the liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date 90 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) of acquisition. The maximum potential amount of future payments it could be required to make for such obligations is undeterminable at this time. deCODE has no liabilities recorded for these future payments as of December 31, 2008. Indemnification deCODE enters into indemnification provisions under (i) its agreements with other companies in its ordinary course of business, typically with business partners, contractors, clinical sites and customers and (ii) its agreements with investors. Under these provisions deCODE generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of deCODE's activities or, in some cases, as a result of the indemnified party's activities under the agreement. These indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. In addition, in some cases, deCODE has agreed to reimburse employees for certain expenses and to provide salary continuation during short term disability. The maximum potential amount of future payments deCODE could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. deCODE has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, deCODE has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2008. 17. Litigation Other than claims and legal proceedings that arise form time to time in the ordinary course of business which are not material, deCODE has no pending legal proceedings except as follows: On or about April 20, 2002, an amended class action complaint, captioned In re deCODE genetics, Inc. Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation (01 Civ. 11219(SAS)), alleging violations of federal securities laws in connection with deCODE's initial public offering was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "District Court") on behalf of certain purchasers of deCODE common stock. The complaint names deCODE, two individuals who were executive officers of deCODE at the time of its initial public offering (the "Individual Defendants"), and the two lead underwriters (the "Underwriter Defendants") for our initial public offering in July 2000 (the "IPO") as defendants. deCODE is aware that similar allegations have been made in hundreds of other lawsuits filed (many by some of the same plaintiff law firms) against numerous underwriter defendants and issuer companies (and certain of their current and former officers) in connection with various public offerings conducted in recent years. All of the lawsuits that have been filed in the Southern District of New York have been consolidated for pretrial purposes before United States District Judge Shira Scheindlin. Pursuant to the underwriting agreement executed in connection with our IPO, deCODE has demanded indemnification from the Underwriter Defendants. The Underwriter Defendants have asserted that our request for indemnification is premature. Pursuant to an agreement the Individual Defendants have been dismissed from the case without prejudice. On July 31, 2003, our Board of Directors (other than our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who recused himself because he was an Individual Defendant) approved a proposed partial settlement with the plaintiffs in this matter, subject to a number of conditions, including the participation of a substantial number of other issuer defendants in the proposed settlement, the consent of deCODE's insurers to the settlement, and the completion of acceptable final settlement documentation. A settlement fairness hearing was held on April 24, 2006. On June 25, 2007, the United States District 91 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Court for the Southern District of New York entered an order formally denying the motion for final approval of the settlement agreement because the settlement class could not be certified. On August 14, 2007, the plaintiffs filed their second consolidated amended class action complaints against the "focus cases" and on September 27, 2007, again moved for class certification. The focus cases are a small group of cases that were selected as test cases due to the large number of nearly identical actions which were consolidated in the Initial Public Offering litigation. The court has indicated that the focus cases are intended to provide strong guidance for the other cases. The case involving deCODE is not a focus case. On November 12, 2007, certain of the defendants in the focus case moved to dismiss the second consolidated amended class action complaints. On March 26, 2008, the District Court denied the motions to dismiss except as to Section 11 claims raised by those plaintiffs who sold their securities for a price in excess of the initial offering price and those who purchased outside the previously certified class period. Briefing on the class certification motion was completed in May 2008. That motion was withdrawn without prejudice on October 10, 2008. On February 25, 2009, liaison counsel for the plaintiffs informed the district court that a settlement has been agreed to in principle, subject to formal approval by the parties, and preliminary and final approval by the court. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, deCODE cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of this matter. While deCODE's expenses in this matter to date have been paid primarily by its insurers, if deCODE were required to pay significant monetary damages as a result of an adverse determination in this matter (or any other lawsuits alleging similar claims filed against deCODE and deCODE's directors and officers in the future), deCODE's business could be significantly harmed. Even if such litigation concludes in deCODE's favor, deCODE may be required to expend significant funds to defend against the allegations. deCODE is unable to estimate the range of possible loss from this litigation and no amounts have been provided for it in deCODE's financial statements. 18. Stockholders' Deficit Common Stock In May 2007, deCODE increased its number of authorized common shares to 150,000,000, $0.001 par value common stock. Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote at all meetings of stockholders for each share held by them. The common stock has no preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe for additional shares, no conversion right and no right of redemption. Subject to the rights and preferences of the holders of any preferred stock, the holders of the common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as, when and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. Notes receivable provided in connection with the purchase of common stock are collateralized only by the shares to which they relate, are payable after a fixed period of generally four years and bear a fixed interest rate of generally six percent per annum. Several of the notes that have become due have been extended a further six years without additional interest. The loan becomes payable upon termination of employment and/or when the shares are sold. In December 2005, deCODE filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for the issuance and sale from time to time of debt and equity securities either individually or in units, in one or more offerings, with a total value of up to $100 million. In July 2006 deCODE completed the sale of 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $5.00 per share, for aggregate net proceeds, after costs of the transaction, of $27,724,000. 92 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Preferred Stock At December 31, 2008, deCODE had 6,716,666 shares of undesignated preferred stock authorized and no shares issued or outstanding. In respect of the undesignated shares of preferred stock, deCODE's Board of Directors is authorized, except as otherwise limited by Delaware law, without further action by the stockholders to: issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series; fix or alter the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions), redemption price or prices, and liquidation preferences of any wholly unissued series of preferred stock; designate the number of shares constituting, and the designation of, any series of preferred stock; and increase or decrease the number of shares of a series subsequent to the issue of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding. Warrants Upon the closing of deCODE's public offering in July 2000, warrants to purchase 1,075,833 shares of Series A preferred stock and warrants and options to purchase 416,667 shares of Series C preferred stock automatically converted into warrants and options to purchase the same number of shares of common stock. In May 2002, deCODE issued warrants to purchase 933,800 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $15.00 per share in conjunction with the issuance of debt. These warrants expired unexercised in the year ended December 31, 2007. In February 2004, deCODE issued a warrant to purchase 1,724,257 shares of common stock at $29.00 per share over five years to Merck in connection with a Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement. The warrant is exercisable at Merck's option as to 344,851 shares for a period of 30 days commencing on the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Warrant Agreement. Any portion of this warrant that is not exercised during an applicable exercise period shall expire and be of no further force or effect. As of December 31, 2008, warrants to purchase 344,851 shares of common stock remained outstanding (none exercisable at December 31, 2008). Warrant activity is summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Outstanding at beginning of year 856,371 2,385,022 2,729,873 Issued    Exercised (55,555 ) (250,000 )  Cancelled (344,851 ) (1,278,651 ) (344,851 ) Outstanding at end of year 455,965 856,371 2,385,022 93 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) A summary of the exercisable deCODE warrants as of December 31, 2008, is as follows: Common Shares Issuable for Exercise Price Per Share Warrant Expiration Date 55,556 3.00 May 20, 2009 55,556 4.00 February 10, 2010 111,112 Equity Incentive Plans In May 2006, deCODE adopted the deCODE genetics, Inc. 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"). The 2006 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 4,000,000 shares of common stock to employees, consultants and non-employee directors in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights (SARs). In May 2008, deCODE amended its 2006 Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards to 10,000,000 shares. deCODE also maintains the deCODE genetics, Inc. 1996 and 2002 Equity Incentive Plans (together with the 2006 Plan, the "Plans") that provide for the grant for awards to employees, members of the Board of Directors, consultants and other advisors who are not employees. The 1996 Equity Incentive Plan expired in July 2006. A total of 10,000,000 shares were originally reserved for grants of options and restricted stock under the terms of the 1996 and 2002 Equity Incentive Plans. The equity incentive Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee determines the type and term of each award, the award exercise or purchase price, if applicable, the number of shares underlying each award granted and the rate at which each award becomes vested or exercisable. Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees of deCODE at an exercise price per share of not less than the fair market value per share of common stock on the day before the grant and with a term not to exceed ten years from date of grant. Nonqualified stock options may be granted to any officer, employee, director, consultant or advisor at a per share exercise price in such amount as the Compensation Committee may determine. Generally each employee option grant vests twenty-five percent on the first anniversary date of an employee's commencement of employment and 1/48th of the original grant each month thereafter for the following three years. Upon exercise of options, shares are issued from the pool of registered shares under the Plans. The Compensation Committee may also grant restricted stock and other stock-based awards on such terms and conditions as it may determine, which may include deCODE's right to repurchase the unvested underlying stock upon termination of the holder's employment. Options granted to date generally vest over a period of four years, generally have a maximum term of 10 years, and may contain early-exercise provisions allowing for company-provided financing of the exercise price. In November 2007, deCODE adopted a Change in Control Benefits Plan that provides for, among other things, upon a change in control, all outstanding stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights, and any similar awards under any equity compensation plan of deCODE, shall vest, become immediately exercisable or payable and have all restrictions lifted. As of December 31, 2008, 6,154,945 shares were available for grant under the Plans. 94 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) A summary of stock option activity is presented in the following table: Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (In years) (In thousands) Outstanding at December 31, 2007 7,773,559 $ 6.19 Granted 1,148,000 2.73 Exercised (2,500 ) 2.11 Cancelled (465,704 ) 5.52 Outstanding at December 31, 2008 8,453,355 $ 5.76 6.66 $  Vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2008 8,177,638 $ 5.83 6.57 $  Exercisable at December 31, 2008 5,720,364 $ 6.78 5.83 $  The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on deCODE's closing stock price of $0.19 as of December 31, 2008 (the last trading day for the year ended December 31, 2008), which would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date. The total number of in-the-money options exercisable as of December 31, 2008 was 0. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the Plans determined as of the date of option exercise was $3,000, $128,000 and $528,000 during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $2.55, $3.46 and $4.34, per share, respectively. Cash received from option exercises for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and 2006 was $5,000, $147,000 and $870,000, respectively. The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2008: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Exercise Price Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price (In years) $0.69 to $3.38 1,654,946 $ 2.82 8.58 734,554 $ 2.87 $3.45 to $3.45 2,282,671 3.45 8.11 1,002,700 3.45 $3.46 to $8.06 1,840,554 6.13 6.14 1,408,484 6.58 $8.13 to $8.96 1,811,133 8.78 4.36 1,811,133 8.78 $9.21 to $24.56 864,051 10.39 5.04 763,493 10.53 $0.69 to $24.56 8,453,355 $ 5.76 6.66 5,720,364 $ 6.78 Stock-based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006 deCODE adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based 95 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) payment awards made to deCODE's employees and directors. Stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on the value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in deCODE's Consolidated Statement of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 included compensation expense for stock-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123, and compensation expense for the stock-based payment awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 123R, deCODE elected to attribute the value of stock-based compensation to expense using the straight-line method, which was previously used for its pro forma information required under SFAS 123. deCODE recorded stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, which were allocated based on the functional cost center of each employee as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands, except per share amounts) Operating Expenses: Cost of revenue $ 561 $ 799 $ 612 Research and development 1,134 1,830 1,670 Selling, general and administrative 1,962 3,920 2,232 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 3,657 $ 6,549 $ 4,514 Per basic and diluted share $ 0.06 $ 0.11 $ 0.08 As stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the compensation expense recognized for all share-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. deCODE estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to stock-based compensation expense may be required in future periods. As of December 31, 2008, there was $5,753,000 of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to non-vested stock awards. This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.2 years. The employee stock-based compensation recognized under SFAS 123R was determined using the Black Scholes option valuation model. Option valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions and these assumptions can vary over time. The weighted average assumptions used are as follows. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Expected dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % Expected volatility 63.7 % 64.3 % 65.9 % Expected option life (in years) 5.4 5.5 5.1 Risk-free interest rate 2.8 % 4.4 % 4.7 % 96 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) deCODE estimates the expected term of the options based on historical patterns by employees with respect to exercise and post vesting employment termination behaviors. Expected volatility is based on deCODE's historical volatility and is calculated using a weighted average of the volatility over a period equal to the expected term of the award and the most recent one year volatility. deCODE bases the risk-free interest rate used on the implied yield currently available on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent term. As deCODE does not pay dividends, the dividend rate variable in the Black-Sholes model is zero. Restricted Stock deCODE's Equity Incentive Plans allow for the issuance of restricted stock awards that may not be sold or otherwise transferred until certain restrictions have lapsed. The stock-based compensation expense for these awards is determined based on the market price of deCODE's stock at the date of the grant applied to the total numbers of shares that are anticipated to fully vest and then amortized over the period the restrictions lapse. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, deCODE granted 79,457, 16,184 and 7,588 shares, respectively to its Audit Committee members. These grants remain subject to the right of deCODE to repurchase the shares in certain circumstances through a period of one-year from grant date. In 2005, deCODE granted 50,000 shares to an executive officer which fully vested in July 2008. The following table represents restricted stock activity: Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested restricted shares outstanding, December 31, 2007 54,046 $ 8.96 Restricted shares issued 79,457 0.81 Restricted shares vested (110,251 ) 4.79 Restricted shares forfeited (6,779 ) 1.18 Unvested restricted shares outstanding, December 31, 2008 16,473 $ 0.73 The weighted average remaining contractual term for restricted stock awards was 0.25 years at December 31, 2008. 19. Defined Contribution Benefits deCODE contributes to relevant pension organizations for personnel in Iceland in accordance with Icelandic law and employment practices. Certain other discretionary contributions may be made. Contributions are based on employee salaries paid and deCODE has no further liability in connection with these plans. Total contributions were $1,771,000, $2,686,000 and $2,231,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. deCODE maintains 401(k) pension plans available to eligible full-time employees in the United States. deCODE made contributions of $218,000, $317,000 and $319,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to these plans. 97 deCODE genetics, Inc.

Income Taxes Deferred income taxes include the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts for assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. deCODE's deferred tax assets (liabilities) are comprised of the following: December 31, 2008 2007 (In thousands) Loss carryforwards $ 71,980 $ 95,845 Capitalized research and development costs 16,727 23,667 Deferred revenue 40 1,167 Fixed asset depreciation (779 ) 261 Intangible assets/patents (51 ) (78 ) Other deferred tax assets 9,745 3,466 Total deferred tax asset, net 97,662 124,328 Valuation allowance (97,662 ) (124,328 ) $  $  The table below reconciles the expected U.S. federal income tax rate to the recorded income tax rate: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Income taxes (benefit) at federal statutory rates (34.0 )% (34.0 )% (34.0 )% State income taxes, net of federal benefit (2.4 ) (1.0 ) (0.9 ) Non-deductible equity compensation 1.2 2.4 0.5 Foreign rate differential 10.3 12.4 13.4 Foreign currency adjustment 35.8 (7.7 ) (0.8 ) Tax rate reduction on prior valuation allowances 18.7   Other 3.2 (0.1 ) (0.3 ) Net change in valuation allowance (32.8 ) 28.0 22.1 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Pre-tax U.S. losses were $37,138,000, $21,400,000 and $13,653,000 and pre-tax Icelandic losses were $43,809,000, $74,125,000 and $71,820,000 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, deCODE had U.S. federal net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards of approximately $55,094,000 that may be available to offset future U.S. federal income tax liabilities and expire at various dates through 2027. As of December 31, 2008, deCODE's Icelandic subsidiaries had NOL carryforwards of approximately $302,868,000 and expire at various dates through 2018. Management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets and has established a full valuation allowance for such assets, which are comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards and capitalized research and experimentation costs. 98 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Approximately $655,000 of the net operating loss carryforwards relate to the exercise of non-qualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options, the tax benefit from which, if realized, will be credited to additional paid in capital. Ownership changes, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, may have limited the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. Subsequent ownership changes could further affect the limitation in future years. Adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48 Effective January 1, 2007, deCODE adopted FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Since the IRS has the ability to adjust the amount of a net operating loss utilized on a tax return, all tax years are open until the deCODE begins utilizing its net operating losses. In Iceland, the statute of limitations is six years and as such the Icelandic taxing authorities can reassess the tax back to 2003. In addition, open tax years related to states remain subject to examination but are not considered material. deCODE does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. The statute of limitations for federal, state, and Iceland tax purposes are generally three, four, and six years respectively; however, deCODE continues to carryover tax attributes prior to these periods for federal and state purposes, which would still be open for examination by the respective tax authorities. All years since deCODE's inception are open to tax examinations. 21. Other non-operating income and (expense), net During 2008 and 2007, deCODE recognized an other-than-temporary-loss on investments in auction rate securities ("ARS") (see Note 7). Although the ARS continue to pay interest according to their stated terms, based on valuation models and an analysis of other-than-temporary impairment factors, deCODE recorded an impairment charge of $13,026,000 ($914,000 of which had previously been recognized as temporary and had been accounted for as an unrealized loss at December 31, 2007) and $7,752,000, respectively. In June 2007, deCODE entered into a legal settlement to end ongoing litigation regarding certain proprietary and confidential information. Financial terms of the legal settlement stipulated that deCODE would be paid $9,000,000, which was received by deCODE during the year ended December 31, 2007. deCODE recognized $9,000,000 of the settlement amount during the year ended December 31, 2007, net of related expenses of $785,000. 22. Subsequent Event In January 2009, deCODE entered into an agreement with NBI hf., an Icelandic financial institution, pursuant to which NBI has purchased all auction rate securities ("ARS") owned by deCODE for an aggregate price of ISK 1,375,000,000, which represented approximately $11,000,000 at the then current currency exchange rates. NBI has the put option to require deCODE to repurchase the ARS upon the earlier of (a) the sale of all or a majority of the stock of deCODE genetics ehf, 99 deCODE genetics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) deCODE's Icelandic subsidiary, ("IE") or a specified part of the operations of IE or (b) December 16, 2009. deCODE has the call option to require NBI to sell the ARS to it at any time until January 1, 2010. The repurchase price on exercise of the put or call option (the "Repurchase Price") will be equal to the Purchase Price plus interest from January 16, 2009 at a rate of five percent (5%) above the Reykjavik Interbank Offered Rate in effect on the date payment is made less the aggregate amount of interest and principal received by NBI on the ARS. In addition, if the aggregate amount of interest and principal received by NBI with respect to the ARS is higher than the Repurchase Price, upon deCODE's repurchase of the ARS pursuant to the exercise of the put or call option, NBI will be required to deliver to deCODE, in addition to the ARS, an amount equal to (A) the aggregate amount of principal and interest that it received less (B) the sum of (i) the Repurchase Price and (ii) ISK 375,000,000 (approximately $3,350,000 at current exchange rates). Due to the put and call options, the transaction will be accounted for as a secured borrowing and as such, the ARS will remain on deCODE's Consolidated Balance Sheet and continue to be marked unless the put option as described above is not exercised prior to December 16, 2009. 23.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of deCODE's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of such fiscal year deCODE's disclosure controls and procedures are adequate and effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports deCODE files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the desired objectives of the control system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and the application of judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions. (b) Changes in Internal Controls. We are continuously seeking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our internal controls. This results in periodic refinements to internal control processes throughout the Company. However, there was no significant change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the last fiscal quarter of the year ended December 31, 2008 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on its assessment management believes that, as of December 31, 2008, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 101 The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, which audited the financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. This report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, is included below under the heading "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm." 102 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of deCODE Genetics, Inc. Reykjavik, Iceland We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of deCODE Genetics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 of the Company and our report dated March 31, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph concerning substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Boston, Massachusetts March 31, 2009 103 Item 9B.
