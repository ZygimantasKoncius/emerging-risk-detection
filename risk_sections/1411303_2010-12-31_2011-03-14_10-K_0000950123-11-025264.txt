ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risks set forth below, in addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may also be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us. The United States Economy Was In A Significant Recession. A Prolonged Economic Downturn, Especially One Affecting Our Geographic Market Area, Will Continue to Materially Affect our Business and Financial Results. The United States economy entered a recession in the fourth quarter of 2007. Throughout the course of 2008 and 2009, economic conditions continued to worsen, due initially to the fallout from the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market. While we did not originate or invest in sub-prime mortgages, our lending business is tied, in large part, to the housing market. Declines in home prices, increases in foreclosures and higher unemployment have adversely affected the credit performance of real estate-related loans, resulting in the write-down of asset values. The continuing housing slump also has resulted in reduced demand for the construction of new housing, further declines in home prices, and increased delinquencies on our construction, residential and commercial mortgage loans. Further, the ongoing concern about the stability of the financial markets in general has caused many lenders to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers. These conditions may also cause a further reduction in loan demand, and increases in our non-performing assets, net charge-offs and provisions for loan losses. Median home sales prices in Atlantic County declined from 2009 to 2010 by 5.3% while in Cape May County the median home sales price increased by 13.1%, however the number of sales in both counties decreased for the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of 2010. Unemployment in Atlantic and Cape May County was 12.5% and 13.2% respectively as of December 2010. Additionally residential building permits, which have been declining since 2008, have leveled off in both counties from 2009 to 2010. Continuing Weakness in the Financial Services Industry And the Credit Markets May Subject Us to Additional Regulation. As a result of the financial crisis, the potential exists for the promulgation of new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, which are expected to result in the issuance of many formal enforcement orders. Negative developments in the financial services industry and the credit markets, and the impact of new legislation in response to these developments, may negatively affect our operations by restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate or sell loans and pursue business opportunities. Compliance with such regulation also will likely increase our costs. 42 Table of Contents Our Emphasis on Commercial Real Estate Loans and Commercial Business Loans May Continue to Expose us to Increased Lending Risks. At December 31, 2010, $428.7 million, or 54.6% of our loan portfolio, consisted of commercial real estate loans, including commercial construction loans. Commercial real estate loans constitute a greater percentage of our loan portfolio than any other loan category, including residential mortgage loans, which totaled $258.0 million, or 32.9% of our total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2010. In addition, at December 31, 2010, $48.2 million, or 6.1% of our loan portfolio, consisted of commercial business loans. Commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans generally expose a lender to a greater risk of loss than one-to-four family residential loans. Repayment of commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally depends, in large part, on sufficient income from the property or the borrowers business to cover operating expenses and debt service. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Changes in economic conditions that are beyond the control of the borrower and lender could affect the value of the security for the loan, the future cash flow of the affected property, or the marketability of a construction project with respect to loans originated for the acquisition and development of property. See BusinessLending Activities. Our Continuing Concentration of Loans in Our Primary Market Area May Increase Our Risk. Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the counties in which we conduct business, and in the Jersey shore community in general. Unlike large banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in Cape May and Atlantic Counties, New Jersey. The local economic conditions in our market area have a significant impact on our loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Should the economic downturn limit discretionary spending, many of the seasonal and vacation oriented businesses may suffer. In addition, the gaming industry is a significant economic force in our market and has already suffered a serious decline in revenues due to the economy and increased regional competition. This situation may worsen in the future. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control, would affect the local economic conditions and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, because we have a significant amount of commercial real estate loans, decreases in tenant occupancy also may have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings. The Atlantic City casino industry has experienced declines in many areas of their business, such as: a. casino revenue in total was down 9.6% in 2010 from 2009; b. all 11 casinos had revenue declines during the period 2009 to 2010; c. 2010 was the worst year for casino revenue during the past 10 years; d. employment levels at the casinos has declined consistently since 2007; e. visitors to Atlantic City have declined consistently from 2007 to 2009 (2010 data not yet available); and f. 2009 net income per casino indicates that 7 of 11 casinos reported losses for the year. In addition to the national, regional and local economies negatively effecting Atlantic City casinos, they have also been negatively affected by competition from casinos in Pennsylvania and Delaware. Pennsylvania currently has 10 operating casinos with the potential of an additional four casinos. These casinos have both slot machines and gaming tables. The impact of Delaware casinos on the Atlantic City casino market is not as significant as Delaware currently only has three casinos which are limited to slot machines. 43 Table of Contents The State of New Jersey is making efforts to contribute to the revitalization of Atlantic City in the following ways: a. Established a New Jersey State-run Tourism District within Atlantic City. b. Tax reimbursement incentives for the Revel Casino (assuming financing is obtained by the Revel) up to $261 million of which $125 million will be used to fund various upgrades to the Boardwalk and other parts of the city that surround the Revel Casino. These tax incentives are being provided by New Jerseys Economic Development Authority under the Economic Re-development and Growth Grant Program which is designated to stimulate jobs and investment. It is anticipated the construction of the Revel Casio will create 2,000 construction jobs and upon completion, which is estimated to be June 2012, 5,500 full time positions will be created. c. Consideration of permitting small (minimum 200 rooms and gaming floor area of 24,000 square feet) casino hotels in Atlantic City, and interest in this market has been expressed by certain companies. d. Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA) will oversee operations of the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Authority. e. A discount shopping outlet in Atlantic City is expanding and the CRDA is assisting with this project by lending the developer $9 million towards this project. Future Changes in Interest Rates Could Reduce Our Profits Our ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between: the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The potential exists for the Federal Reserve Bank to raise the target Fed Funds rate in 2011. An increase in interest rates will present us with the challenge of managing interest rate risk with a cumulative three year liability sensitive balance sheet. As detailed in Net Interest Income Analysis, a rising interest rate environment indicates that net interest income would decrease over a one-year horizon. This analysis assumes instantaneous and sustained rate shock intervals of 100 and 200 basis points on a static balance sheet. Management will focus on several strategies to negate such effects, such as extending long-term liabilities, increasing core deposit balances, reducing the amount of long term fixed rate loans in the portfolio, and shortening the average life of investments within the investment portfolio. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A reduction in interest rates normally results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities, as borrowers refinance their loans in order to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Alternatively, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. 44 Table of Contents Changes in interest rates also affect the current market value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2010, the fair value of our available for sale investment securities totaled $157.4 million and the amortized cost of such securities was $165.9 million. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale in future periods would have an adverse effect on stockholders equity. We evaluate interest rate sensitivity by estimating the change in Cape Banks net portfolio value over a range of interest rate scenarios. Net portfolio value is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2010, in the event of an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 1.5% decrease in net portfolio value and a $1.0 million decrease in net interest income. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsManagement of Market Risk. An Inadequate Allowance for Loan Losses Would Negatively Affect Our Results of Operations. We are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans will not be sufficient to avoid losses. Credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Volatility and deterioration in the broader economy may also increase our risk of credit losses. The determination of an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses is an inherently uncertain process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond our control, and charge-offs may exceed current estimates. We evaluate the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate based upon such factors as, including, but not limited to: the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans; previous loan loss experience; specific loans that have loss potential; delinquency trends; the estimated fair market value of the collateral; current economic conditions; the views of our regulators; and geographic and industry loan concentrations. If any of our evaluations are incorrect and borrower defaults result in losses exceeding our allowance for loan losses, our results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected. We cannot be certain that our allowance will be adequate to cover probable loan losses inherent in our portfolio. Future Legislative or Regulatory Actions Responding to Perceived Financial and Market Problems Could Impair Our Rights Against Borrowers There have been proposals made by members of Congress and others that would reduce the amount distressed borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit a lenders ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral. If proposals such as these, or other proposals limiting our rights as a creditor, are implemented, we could experience increased credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor. Should such legislation be implemented Cape Bank could be directly impacted for those loans held directly within the portfolio. Such legislation could also have a major impact on loans underlying and collateralizing mortgage-backed securities and thus indirectly affect Cape by decreasing the value of securities held in the investment portfolio. 45 Table of Contents We Are Subject to Extensive Regulatory Oversight We and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision. Regulators have intensified their focus on bank lending criteria and controls, and on the USA PATRIOT Acts anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance requirements. There is also increased scrutiny of our compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. In order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in the anti-money laundering area, we have been required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems. We cannot be certain that the policies, procedures and systems we have in place meet every aspect of current regulation. Therefore, there is no assurance that in every instance we are in full compliance with these requirements. Our failure to comply with these and other regulatory requirements can lead to, among other remedies, administrative enforcement actions, and legal proceedings. In addition, recently enacted, proposed and future legislation and regulations have had, will continue to have or may have significant impact on the financial services industry. Regulatory or legislative changes could make regulatory compliance more difficult or expensive for us, and could cause us to change or limit some of our products and services, or the way we operate our business. The Need to Account for Assets at Market Prices May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations. We report certain assets, including investments and securities, at fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value. Because we carry these assets on our books at their fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk. Given the continued disruption in the capital markets, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments in future periods with respect to securities in our portfolio. The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment (OTTI) Could Reduce Our Earnings. We evaluate our investment securities for OTTI as required by FASB ASC Topic No. 320, Investments  Debt and Equity Securities. When a decline in fair value below cost is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the impairment must be recognized as a charge to earnings to the extent it is related to credit losses. In determining whether or not OTTI exists, management considers several factors, including the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, adverse changes to projected cash flows, credit rating downgrades, and our intentions with regard to selling the securities or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities prior to the anticipated recovery in fair value. The greatest risk of OTTI exists in our investment securities portfolio and in particular with the CDO and non-agency CMO securities that we own. As of December 31, 2010, if these securities were deemed to be OTTI and the entire amount was related to credit losses, the pro forma reduction to our net income would be approximately $0.69 per share. Lack of Consumer Confidence in Financial Institutions May Decrease Our Level of Deposits. Our level of deposits may be affected by lack of consumer confidence in financial institutions, which have caused fewer depositors to be willing to maintain deposits that are not FDIC insured accounts. This may cause depositors to withdraw deposits and place them in other institutions or to invest uninsured funds in investments perceived as being more secure, such as securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. These consumer preferences may force us to pay higher interest rates to retain deposits and may constrain liquidity as we seek to meet funding needs caused by reduced deposit levels. A Breach of Information Security Could Negatively Affect Our Earnings. Increasingly, we depend upon data processing, communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks, and over the internet. We cannot be certain all our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack, despite safeguards we have instituted. In addition, we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Disruptions to our vendors systems may arise from events that are wholly or partially beyond our vendors control (including, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages). If information security is breached, despite the controls we have instituted, information can be lost or misappropriated, resulting in financial loss or costs to us or damages to others. These costs or losses could materially exceed the amount of insurance coverage, if any, which would adversely affect our earnings. 46 Table of Contents Changes in the Value of Goodwill and Intangible Assets Could Reduce Our Earnings. We are required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually. Testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets involves the identification of reporting units and the estimation of fair values. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. As of December 31, 2010, if our goodwill and intangible assets were fully impaired and we were required to charge-off all of our goodwill, the pro forma reduction to our net income would be approximately $1.86 per share. Our Expenses May Increase as a Result of Possible Increases in FDIC Insurance Premiums. The FDIC imposes an assessment against financial institutions for deposit insurance. Due to the number of failed financial institutions and the fact that the insurance fund is below statutory requirements, additional assessments may be required. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. If Our Investment in The Federal Home Loan Bank Of New York is Classified as Other-Than-Temporarily Impaired or as Permanently Impaired, Our Earnings and Stockholders Equity Could Decrease. We own common stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. We hold this stock to qualify for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the Federal Home Loan Bank of New Yorks advance program. The aggregate cost and fair value of our Federal Home Loan Bank common stock as of December 31, 2010 was $8.7 million based on its par value. There is no market for our Federal Home Loan Bank common stock. Published reports indicate that certain member banks of the Federal Home Loan Bank System may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could result in materially lower regulatory capital levels. In an extreme situation, it is possible that the capitalization of a Federal Home Loan Bank, including the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero. Consequently, we believe that there is a risk that our investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of New York common stock could be impaired at some time in the future, and if this occurs, it would cause our earnings and stockholders equity to decrease by the after-tax amount of the impairment charge. If the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stops Paying Dividends, This Will Negatively Affect Our Earnings. We received dividends of $416,000 on our Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock in 2010. However, no assurances can be given that these dividends will continue to be paid in the future. The failure of the Federal Home Loan Bank to pay dividends in the future will cause our earnings to decrease. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
