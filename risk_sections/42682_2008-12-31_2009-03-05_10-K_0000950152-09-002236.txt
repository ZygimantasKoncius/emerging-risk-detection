ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Market influences and cost pressures The overall pump industry is cyclical in nature, and business activity is somewhat related to conditions in the durable goods and capital equipment markets. The Company cannot predict the timing or extent of future economic or market swings. Additionally, raw material and energy purchases are major drivers of costs in the manufacture of pumps, and these costs are highly unpredictable. While efforts are made to recoup higher production costs through increased prices, the future acceptability of such price increases by customers is not guaranteed due to the highly competitive market place. Family ownership of common equity A substantial percentage of the CompanyÂ’s Common Shares is held by various members of the Gorman and Rupp families and their affiliates. These family holdings do not typically trade; therefore, the Common Shares, in part because of these circumstances, generally have a history of relatively thin trading experiences on the NYSE Alternext (formerly American Stock Exchange). ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS The Company has not received any written comments from the Commission staff regarding its periodic or current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 within 180 days before the end of its fiscal year to which this Form10-K relates.
