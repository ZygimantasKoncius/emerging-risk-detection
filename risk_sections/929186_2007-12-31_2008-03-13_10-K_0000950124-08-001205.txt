Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Business  Any downgrade in the A.M. Best rating of FMIC would prevent us from successfully engaging in direct insurance writing or obtaining adequate reinsurance on competitive terms, which would lead to a decrease in revenue and net income. EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2007, we had 195 full-time employees and 7 part-time employees. Our employees have no union affiliations and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. INSURANCE REGULATION Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes of various jurisdictions, including Illinois, the domiciliary state of FMIC, and Minnesota, the domiciliary state of ANIC. In addition, we are subject to regulation by the state insurance regulators of other states and foreign jurisdictions in which we or our operating subsidiaries do business. State insurance regulations generally are designed to protect the interests of policyholders, consumers or claimants rather than stockholders, noteholders or other investors. The nature and extent of state regulation varies by jurisdiction, and state insurance regulators generally have broad administrative power relating to, among other matters, setting capital and surplus requirements, licensing of insurers and agents, establishing standards for reserve adequacy, prescribing statutory accounting methods and the form and content of 12 Table of Contents statutory financial reports, regulating certain transactions with affiliates and prescribing the types and amounts of investments. In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate insurance companies. Although the federal government is not the primary direct regulator of the insurance business, federal initiatives often affect the insurance industry and possible increased regulation of insurance by the federal government continues to be discussed by lawmakers. In addition to state imposed insurance laws and regulations, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the statutory accounting practices and reporting formats established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC. The NAIC also promulgates model insurance laws and regulations relating to the financial and operational regulation of insurance companies. These model laws and regulations generally are not directly applicable to an insurance company unless and until they are adopted by applicable state legislatures or departments of insurance. All states have adopted the NAICs financial reporting form, which is typically referred to as the NAIC annual statement, and all states generally follow the codified statutory accounting practices promulgated by the NAIC. In this regard, the NAIC has a substantial degree of practical influence and is able to accomplish certain quasi legislative initiatives through amendments to the NAIC annual statement and applicable accounting practices and procedures. Insurance companies also are affected by a variety of state and federal legislative and regulatory measures and judicial decisions that define and qualify the risks and benefits for which insurance is sought and provided. These include redefining risk exposure in such areas as product liability, environmental damage and workers compensation. In addition, individual state insurance departments may prevent premium rates for some classes of insureds from adequately reflecting the level of risk assumed by the insurer for those classes. Such developments may result in adverse effects on the profitability of various lines of insurance. In some cases, these adverse effects on profitability can be minimized, when possible, through the repricing of coverages to the extent permitted by applicable regulations, or the limitation or cessation of the affected business, which may be restricted by state law. Required Licensing FMIC operates on a non-admitted or surplus lines basis and is authorized in 51 states and jurisdictions. While FMIC does not have to apply for and maintain a license in those states, it is subject to meeting and maintaining eligibility standards or approval under each particular states surplus lines laws in order to be an eligible surplus line carrier. FMIC maintains surplus line approvals or eligibility in all states in which it operates and therefore FMIC is not subject to the rate and form filing requirements applicable to licensed or admitted insurers. Surplus lines insurance must be written through agents and brokers who are licensed as surplus lines brokers. The broker or their retail insurance agents generally are required to certify that a certain number of licensed admitted insurers had been offered and declined to write a particular risk prior to placing that risk with us. ANIC is licensed and can operate on an admitted basis in its home state of Minnesota and in 14 other states. Insurers operating on an admitted basis must file premium rate schedules and policy forms for review and, in some states, approval by the insurance regulators in each state in which they do business on an admitted basis. Admitted carriers also are subject to other market conduct regulation and examinations in the states in which they are licensed. Insurance regulators have broad discretion in judging whether an admitted insurers rates are adequate, not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory. Insurance Holding Company Regulation Our insurance subsidiaries operate as part of an insurance holding company system and are subject to holding company regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are licensed. These regulations require that each insurance company that is part of a holding company system register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning contracts, transactions, and relationships between those insurance companies and companies within the holding company system. Transactions between insurance subsidiaries and their parents and affiliates generally must be disclosed to the state regulators, and prior approval or nondisapproval of the applicable 13 Table of Contents state insurance regulator generally is required for any material or other specified transactions. The insurance laws similarly provide that all transactions and agreements between an insurance company and members of a holding company system must be fair and reasonable. FMIC and ANIC are parties to various agreements, including underwriting agreements, a management service agreement, and a tax sharing agreement with members of the holding company system and are parties to reinsurance agreements with each other, all of which are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company acts. In addition, a change of control of an insurer or of any controlling person requires the prior approval of the domestic state insurance regulator. Generally, any person who acquires 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the insurer or its parent company is presumed to have acquired control of the insurer. A person seeking to acquire control, directly or indirectly, of an insurance company or of any person controlling an insurance company generally must file with the domestic insurance regulatory authority a statement relating to the acquisition of control containing certain information about the acquiring party and the transaction required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy of such statement to the insurer and obtain the prior approval of such regulatory agency for the acquisition. Quarterly and Annual Financial Reporting Our insurance subsidiaries are required to file quarterly and annual financial reports with state insurance regulators utilizing statutory accounting practices (SAP) rather than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In keeping with the intent to assure policyholder protection, SAP emphasize solvency considerations. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Periodic Financial and Market Conduct Examinations The insurance departments of our insurance subsidiaries states of domicile may conduct on-site visits and examinations of the affairs of our insurance subsidiaries, including their financial condition and their relationships and transactions with affiliates, typically every three to five years, and may conduct special or target examinations to address particular concerns or issues at any time. Insurance regulators of other states in which we do business also may conduct examinations. The results of these examinations can give rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive or other corrective action. Insurance regulatory authorities have broad administrative powers to regulate trade practices and to restrict or rescind licenses or other authorizations to transact business and to levy fines and monetary penalties against insurers, insurance agents and brokers found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations. During the past five years, the insurance subsidiaries have had periodic financial reviews and have not been the subject of market conduct or other investigations or been required to pay any material fines or penalties. Risk-based Capital Risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements laws are designed to assess the minimum amount of capital that an insurance company needs to support its overall business operations and to ensure that it has an acceptably low expectation of becoming financially impaired. Regulators use RBC to set capital requirements considering the size and degree of risk taken by the insurer and taking into account various risk factors including asset risk, credit risk, underwriting risk and interest rate risk. As the ratio of an insurers total adjusted capital and surplus decreases relative to its risk-based capital, the RBC laws provide for increasing levels of regulatory intervention culminating with mandatory control of the operations of the insurer by the domiciliary insurance department at the so-called mandatory control level. At December 31, 2007, our insurance subsidiaries maintained RBC levels in excess of amounts that would require any corrective actions on our part. IRIS Ratios The NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, is part of a collection of analytical tools designed to provide state insurance regulators with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS is intended to assist state insurance regulators in targeting resources to those insurers in greatest need of regulatory attention. IRIS consists of two 14 Table of Contents phases: statistical and analytical. In the statistical phase, the NAIC database generates key financial ratio results based on financial information obtained from insurers annual statutory statements. The analytical phase is a review of the annual statements, financial ratios and other automated solvency tools. The primary goal of the analytical phase is to identify companies that appear to require immediate regulatory attention. A ratio result falling outside the usual range of IRIS ratios is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. An insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are in themselves immaterial. As of December 31, 2007, FMIC did not have any IRIS ratios outside the usual range. As of December 31, 2007, ANIC had IRIS ratios outside the usual range in one of the IRIS tests relating to policyholders surplus. An insurance company may become the subject of increased scrutiny when four or more of its IRIS ratios fall outside the range deemed usual by the NAIC. The nature of increased regulatory scrutiny resulting from IRIS ratios that are outside the usual range is subject to the judgment of the applicable state insurance department, but generally will result in accelerated review of annual and quarterly filings. Depending on the nature and severity of the underlying cause of the IRIS ratios being outside the usual range, increased regulatory scrutiny could range from increased but informal regulatory oversight to placing a company under regulatory control. As of December 31, 2007, ANIC had one IRIS ratio outside of the usual range, as set forth in the following table: Ratio Usual Range Actual Results Gross change in policyholders surplus −10% to 50% 90 % ANIC has experienced growth in surplus primarily resulting from a $10.0 million capital contribution made to ANIC in September 2007 and from operating results during 2007 of $3.6 million. Restrictions on Paying Dividends We are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Consequently, our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and meet our debt payment obligations is dependent on dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries. State insurance laws restrict the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to declare stockholder dividends. State insurance regulators require insurance companies to maintain specified levels of statutory capital and surplus. Generally, dividends may be paid only out of earned surplus, and the amount of an insurers surplus following payment of any dividends must be reasonable in relation to the insurers outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs. Further, prior approval from the insurance departments of our insurance subsidiaries states of domicile generally is required in order for our insurance subsidiaries to declare and pay extraordinary dividends to us. For FMIC, Illinois defines an extraordinary dividend as any dividend or distribution that, together with other distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of 10% of FMICs surplus as of the preceding December 31, or FMICs net income for the 12 month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles. FMIC must give the Illinois insurance regulator written notice of every dividend or distribution, whether or not extraordinary, within the time periods specified under applicable law. With respect to ANIC, Minnesota imposes a similar restriction on extraordinary dividends and requires a similar notice of all dividends after declaration and before paid. For ANIC, Minnesota defines an extraordinary dividend as any dividend or distribution that, together with other distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurers surplus as of the preceding December 31, or ANICs net income, not including realized capital gains, for the 12 month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles. Based on the policyholders surplus and the net income of our insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007, FMIC and ANIC may pay dividends in 2008, if declared, of up to $19.0 million without regulatory approval. In 2007 and 2006, our insurance subsidiaries would have been permitted to pay up to $15.7 million and $9.7 million, respectively, in ordinary dividends without the prior regulatory approval. State insurance regulatory authorities that have jurisdiction over the payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries may in the future adopt statutory provisions more restrictive than those currently in effect. No dividends were paid by either FMIC or ANIC during the year ended December 31, 2007. 15 Table of Contents Investment Regulation Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws which require diversification of their investment portfolios and impose limits on the amount of their investments in certain categories. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as non-admitted assets in the states in which they are licensed to sell insurance policies for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, would require them to sell those investments. At December 31, 2007, we had no investments that would be treated as non-admitted assets. Guaranty Funds Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business on an admitted basis in a state can be assessed for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The maximum guaranty fund assessments in any one year typically is between 1.0% to 2.0% of a companys net direct written premium written in the state for the preceding calendar year on the types of insurance covered by the fund. In most states, guaranty fund assessments can be recouped at least in part through future premium increases or offsets to state premium tax liability. In most states, FMIC is not subject to state guaranty fund assessments because of its status as a surplus lines insurer. Licensing of Agents, Brokers and Adjusters CoverX is licensed as a resident producer and surplus lines broker in the State of Michigan and as a non-resident producer/agency and/or surplus lines broker in other states. CoverX and our insurance subsidiaries have obligations to ensure that they pay commissions to only properly licensed insurance producers/brokers. In certain states in which we operate, insurance claims adjusters also are required to be licensed and in some states must fulfill annual continuing education requirements. Privacy Regulations In 1999, the United States Congress enacted the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, which, among other things, protects consumers from the unauthorized dissemination of certain personal information by financial institutions. Subsequently, all states have implemented similar or additional regulations to address privacy issues that are applicable to the insurance industry. These regulations limit disclosure by insurance companies and insurance producers of nonpublic personal information about individuals who obtain insurance or other financial products or services for personal, family, or household purposes. The Gramm Leach Bliley Act and the regulations generally apply to disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties, subject to specified exceptions, but not to disclosures to affiliates. The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes similar limitations on the disclosure and use of certain types of consumer information among affiliates. State privacy laws also require ANIC to maintain appropriate procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of its applicable customers and to disclose to them its privacy practices. In 2002, to further facilitate the implementation of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, the NAIC adopted the Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information Model Regulation. A majority of states have adopted similar provisions regarding the safeguarding of nonpublic personal information. ANIC has adopted a privacy policy for safeguarding nonpublic personal information, and ANIC follows procedures pertaining to applicable customers to comply with the Gramm Leach Bliley Acts related privacy requirements. We may also be subject to future privacy laws and regulations, which could impose additional costs and impact our results of operations or financial condition. Trade Practices The manner in which insurance companies and insurance agents and brokers conduct the business of insurance is regulated by state statutes in an effort to prohibit practices that constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Prohibited practices include, but are not limited to, disseminating false information or advertising, unfair discrimination, rebating and false statements. 16 Table of Contents Unfair Claims Practices Generally, insurance companies, adjusting companies and individual claims adjusters are prohibited by state statutes from engaging in unfair claims practices on a willful basis or with such frequency to indicate a general business practice. Unfair claims practices include, but are not limited to, misrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions; failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies; and attempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a reasonable person would have believed such person was entitled. Investigation of Broker Compensation Practices The recent investigations and legal actions brought by the New York State Attorney General and other attorneys general and state insurance departments relating to broker compensation practices, as well as other measures (such as proposed legislation) that have been taken to address some of the practices at issue in those investigations and actions, may result in potentially far-reaching changes in industry broker compensation practices. These investigations are continuing, and market practices are still evolving in response to these developments. We cannot predict what practices the market will ultimately adopt or how these changes will affect our competitive standing with brokers and agents or our commission rates. Restrictions on Cancellation, Non-renewal or Withdrawal Many states have laws and regulations that limit the ability of an insurance company licensed by that state to exit a market. Some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business in the state, except pursuant to a plan approved by the state insurance regulator. Regulators may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption. Some state statutes explicitly, or by interpretation, apply these restrictions to insurers operating on a surplus line basis. Terrorism Exclusion Regulatory Activity The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, extended and amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, or TRIA, provides insurers with federally funded reinsurance for acts of terrorism. TRIA also requires insurers to make coverage for acts of terrorism available in certain commercial property/casualty insurance policies and to comply with various other provisions of TRIA. For applicable policies in force on or after November 26, 2002, we are required to provide coverage for losses arising from acts of terrorism as defined by TRIA on terms and in amounts which may not differ materially from other policy coverages. To be covered under TRIA, aggregate industry losses from a terrorist act must exceed $100.0 million in 2007, the act must be perpetrated within the U.S. or in certain instances outside of the U.S. on behalf of a foreign person or interest and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury must certify that the act is covered under the program. We generally offer coverage only for those acts covered under TRIA. As of December 31, 2007, we estimate that less than 2% of our policyholders in our E&S lines markets had purchased TRIA coverage. While the provisions of TRIA and the purchase of terrorism coverage described above mitigate our exposure in the event of a large scale terrorist attack, our effective deductible is significant. Generally, we exclude acts of terrorism outside of the TRIA coverage, such as domestic terrorist acts. Regardless of TRIA, some state insurance regulators do not permit terrorism exclusions for various coverages or causes of loss. OFAC The Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Asset Control, or OFAC, maintains various economic sanctions regulations against certain foreign countries and groups and prohibits U.S. Persons from engaging in certain transactions with certain persons or entities in or associated with those countries or groups. One key element of these sanctions regulations is a list maintained by the OFAC of Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, or the SDN List. The SDN List identifies persons and entities that the government believes are associated with terrorists, rogue nations and /or drug traffickers. 17 Table of Contents OFACs regulations, among other things, prohibit insurers and others from doing business with persons or entities on the SDN List. If the insurer finds and confirms a match, the insurer must take steps to block or reject the transaction, notify the affected person and file a report with OFAC. The focus on insurers responsibilities with respect to the sanctions regulations compliance has increased significantly since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Federal Regulation of Insurance While the business of insurance traditionally has been subject to regulation by the states, there continue to be discussions among lawmakers and members of the insurance industry over the possible expanded role of the federal government in regulating the insurance industry. There have been recent calls by insurer and broker trade associations for optional federal chartering of insurance companies, similar to the federal chartering of banks in the United States. In October 2006, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act, which would greatly reduce the overlap in state regulation of surplus lines transactions and reinsurer financial oversight. The measure was not brought up for consideration in the Senate; however, similar legislation has been introduced in both the House and the Senate in 2007. We cannot predict whether or not these or similar federal regulatory schemes will be enacted or, if enacted, what effect they may have on our insurance subsidiaries. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to Our Business Any downgrade in the A.M. Best rating of FMIC would prevent us from successfully engaging in direct insurance writing or obtaining adequate reinsurance on competitive terms, which would lead to a decrease in revenue and net income. Third party rating agencies periodically assess and rate the claims-paying ability of insurers based on criteria established by the rating agencies. FMIC maintains an A− rating (the fourth highest of fifteen ratings) with a stable outlook from A.M. Best Company, Inc., or A.M. Best, a rating agency and publisher for the insurance industry. This rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities but is viewed by insurance consumers and intermediaries as a key indicator of the financial strength and quality of an insurer. FMIC currently has the lowest rating necessary to compete in our targeted markets as a direct insurance writer because an A− rating or higher is required by many insurance brokers, agents and policyholders when obtaining insurance and by many insurance companies that reinsure portions of our policies. Our A.M. Best rating is based on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include our business profile and the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries, which is adversely affected by underwriting losses and dividends paid by them to us. Other factors include balance sheet strength (including capital adequacy and loss and loss adjustment expense reserve adequacy) and operating performance. Any downgrade of our ratings could cause our current and future brokers and agents, retail brokers and insureds to choose other, more highly rated, competitors and increase the cost or reduce the availability of reinsurance to us. Without at least an A− A.M. Best rating for FMIC, we could not competitively engage in direct insurance writing, but instead would be heavily dependent on fronting carriers to underwrite premiums. These fronting arrangements would require us to pay significant fees, which could then cause our earnings to decline. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into fronting arrangements on acceptable terms, which would impair our ability to operate our business. Effective January 1, 2007, FMIC and ANIC entered into an intercompany pooling reinsurance agreement wherein all premiums, losses and expenses of FMIC and ANIC are combined and apportioned between FMIC and ANIC in accordance with fixed percentages. On May 4, 2007, A.M. Best assigned the financial strength rating A− to the First Mercury Group pool and its members, FMIC and ANIC, affirming FMICs A− rating and upgrading ANICs rating to A−. 18 Table of Contents Our actual incurred losses may be greater than our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations. We are liable for losses and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies issued directly by us and under those for which we assume reinsurance obligations. As a result, if we fail to accurately assess the risk associated with the business that we insure, our loss reserves may be inadequate to cover our actual losses. In many cases, several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss. In addition, our policies generally do not provide limits on defense costs, which could increase our liability exposure under our policies. We establish loss and loss adjustment expense reserves with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each period. Our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were $272.4 million, $191.0 million, and $113.9 million at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, all of which are gross of ceded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. These reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are our estimates based upon various factors, including:  actuarial projections of what we, at a given time, expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims reflecting facts and circumstances then known;  estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency;  assessment of asserted theories of liability; and  analysis of other factors, such as variables in claims handling procedures, economic factors and judicial and legislative trends and actions. Most or all of these factors are not directly or precisely quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and are subject to a significant degree of variability over time. For example, insurers have been held liable for large awards of punitive damages, which generally are not reserved for. In many cases, estimates are made more difficult by significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer and additional lags between the time of reporting and final settlement of claims. Accordingly, the ultimate liability may be more or less than the current estimate. While we set our reserves based on our assessment of the insurance risk assumed, as we have expanded into new specialty classes of business, we do not have extensive proprietary loss data for other specialty classes to use to develop reserves. Instead, we must rely on industry loss information, which may not reflect our actual claims results. As a result, our continued expansion into new specialty classes may make it more difficult to ensure that our actual losses are within our loss reserves. If any of our reserves should prove to be inadequate, we will be required to increase reserves, resulting in a reduction in our net income and stockholders equity in the period in which the deficiency is identified. In addition, future loss experience substantially in excess of established reserves could also have a material adverse effect on future earnings and liquidity as well as our financial strength rating. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, we are only permitted to establish loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for losses that have occurred on or before the financial statement date. Case reserves and incurred but not reported, or IBNR, reserves contemplate these obligations. No contingency reserve allowances are established to account for future loss occurrences. Losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the losses are incurred and could be substantial. We bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers, and if any reinsurer fails to pay us, or fails to pay us on a timely basis, we could experience losses. Reinsurance is a practice whereby one insurer, called the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurer, called the ceding insurer, for all or part of the potential liability arising from one or more insurance policies issued by the ceding insurer. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent of the risk transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, this arrangement does not relieve us of our primary liability to our policyholders. Moreover, our primary liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses under the insurance policies that we underwrite has increased as our business shifted from relying on fronting arrangements to our direct writing of insurance. At 19 Table of Contents December 31, 2007, we had $157.6 million of reinsurance recoverables. We expect our recoverables from reinsurers will increase as we increase the insurance that we directly write instead of using a fronting relationship. Under fronting arrangements, policies produced by our CoverX subsidiary were directly written by third party insurers, and a portion of the risk under these policies was assumed by us or other reinsurers for a portion of the related premium. With the elimination of most of our fronting relationships in May 2005, we became the direct writer of substantially all of the policies produced by us, and as a result, our premiums ceded to reinsurers has increased from 2005 to 2007. Most of our reinsurance recoverables are from three reinsurers, two of which are subsidiaries of ACE Limited and Swiss Re. The third reinsurer is American Constantine Insurance Company. At December 31, 2007, the balances from ACE Limited, Swiss Re, and American Constantine Insurance Company were $80.3 million, $52.9 million and $6.2 million, respectively. Although we believe that we have high internal standards for reinsurers with whom we place reinsurance, we cannot assure you that our reinsurers will pay reinsurance claims on a timely basis or at all. If reinsurers are unwilling or unable to pay us amounts due under reinsurance contracts, we will incur unexpected losses and our cash flow will be adversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We may not be able to obtain adequate reinsurance coverage or reinsurance on acceptable terms. We use significant amounts of reinsurance to manage our exposure to market and insurance risks and to enable us to write policies in excess of the level that our capital supports. The availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, both in terms of price and available capacity, which can affect our business volume and profitability. Without adequate levels of appropriately priced reinsurance, the level of premiums we can underwrite could be materially reduced. The reinsurance market has changed dramatically over the past few years as a result of a number of factors, including inadequate pricing, poor underwriting and the significant losses incurred as a consequence of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. As a result, reinsurers have exited some lines of business, reduced available capacity and implemented provisions in their contracts designed to reduce their exposure to loss. In addition, the historical results of reinsurance programs and the availability of capital also affect the availability of reinsurance. Our reinsurance facilities generally are subject to annual renewal and are principally from four reinsurers. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or that we will be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. The failure of any of the loss limitations or exclusions we employ or changes in other claim or coverage issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations. Various provisions of our policies, such as loss limitations, exclusions from coverage or choice of forum, which have been negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. At the present time, we employ a variety of endorsements to our policies in an attempt to limit exposure to known risks. As industry practices and legal, social and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the size or number of claims. Recent examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include increases in the number and size of claims relating to construction defects, which often present complex coverage and damage valuation questions. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business. In addition, we craft our insurance policy language to limit our exposure to expanding theories of legal liability such as those which have given rise to claims for lead paint, asbestos, mold and construction defects. Many of the policies we issue also include conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims to us and our right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition, as well as limitations restricting the period during which a policyholder may bring a breach of contract or other claim against our company, which in many cases is shorter than the statutory limitations for such claims in the states in which we write business. It is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or that legislation could be enacted which modifies or bars the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would adversely affect our loss experience, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. 20 Table of Contents As a result, we may not know the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts for many years after a contract is issued. The lack of long-term operating history and proprietary data on claims results for relatively new specialty classes may cause our future results to be less predictable. Since 2000, we have expanded our focus on new classes of the specialty insurance market, which we refer to as other specialty classes, in addition to our long-standing business for security classes. Other specialty classes represented 24.2% of our premiums produced in 2000 and 75.8% of our premiums produced in 2007. As a result of this expansion, we have a more limited operating and financial history available for other specialty classes when compared to our data for security classes. This may adversely impact our ability to adequately price the insurance we write to reflect the risk assumed and to exclude risks that generate large or frequent claims and to establish appropriate loss reserves. For example, in 2005, we increased our reserves applicable to other specialty classes by approximately $6.2 million, principally as a result of using updated industry loss development factors in the calculations of ultimate expected losses and reserves on those classes that we believed were more closely aligned with our classifications and coverage limits and actual emerging experience. Because we rely more heavily on industry data in calculating reserves for other specialty classes than we do for security classes, we may need to further adjust our reserve estimates for other specialty classes in the future, which could materially adversely affect our operating results. Our growth may be dependent upon our successful acquisition and retention of additional underwriting expertise. Our operating results and future growth depend, in part, on the acquisition and successful retention of underwriting expertise. We rely on a small number of underwriters in the other specialty classes for which we write policies. For example, we significantly expanded our business into other specialty classes in 2000 by hiring three senior underwriters and we introduced legal professional liability coverage by contracting with one underwriter who operates in Boston. In addition, we intend to continue to expand into other specialty classes through the acquisition of key underwriting personnel. While we intend to continue to search for suitable candidates to augment and supplement our underwriting expertise in existing and additional classes of specialty insurance, we may not be successful in identifying, hiring and retaining candidates. If we are successful in identifying candidates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire and retain them or, if they are hired and retained, that they will be successful in enhancing our business or generating an underwriting profit. We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms. Our future capital requirements, especially those of our insurance subsidiaries, depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses and loss adjustment expenses. We may need to raise additional funds to the extent that our cash flows are insufficient to fund future operating requirements, support growth and maintain our A.M. Best rating. Many factors will affect our capital needs, including our growth and profitability, our claims experience, and the availability of reinsurance, as well as possible acquisition opportunities, market disruptions and other unforeseeable developments. If we have to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available or may be available only on terms, amounts or time periods that are not favorable to us. Equity financings could be dilutive to our existing stockholders and debt financings could subject us to covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business freely. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our business could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key employees. We are substantially dependent on a small number of key employees at our operating companies, in particular Richard H. Smith, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and our key underwriting employees. We believe that the experience and reputation in the insurance industry of Mr. Smith and our key underwriting employees are important factors in our ability to attract new business. Our success has been, and will continue to be, dependent on 21 Table of Contents our ability to retain the services of our existing key employees and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. As we continue to grow, we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel, but we may be unsuccessful in doing so. The loss of the services of Mr. Smith or any other key employee, or the inability to identify, hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could adversely affect the quality and profitability of our operations. Our insurance business is concentrated in relatively few specialty classes. Premiums produced for security classes represented 24.2% of our total direct and assumed written premiums in 2007. As a result, any changes in the security insurance market, such as changes in business, economic or regulatory conditions or changes in federal or state law or legal precedents, could adversely impact our ability to write insurance for this market. For example, any legal outcome or other incident could have the effect of increasing insurance claims in the security insurance market which could adversely impact our operating results. The loss of one or more of our top wholesale brokers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations. For security classes, we generate business from traditional E&S lines insurance wholesalers and specialists that focus on security guards and detectives, alarm installation and service businesses and safety equipment installation and service businesses. These wholesalers and specialists are not under any contractual obligation to provide us business. Our top five wholesale brokers represented 36.1% of the premiums produced from security classes in 2007. For other specialty classes, we generate business from traditional E&S lines insurance wholesalers who have a presence in the other specialty classes we underwrite. Our top five wholesale brokers represented 29.6% of the premiums produced from other specialty classes in 2007. In certain other specialty classes, we rely on a small number of agents to generate the insurance that we underwrite. For example, substantially all of our legal professional liability coverage is generated by one agent. The loss of one or more of our top wholesale brokers for security classes or other specialty classes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive environment, which makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain business. The insurance industry in general and the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and we believe that they will remain so for the foreseeable future. We face competition from several companies, which include insurance companies, reinsurance companies, underwriting agencies, contract underwriters and captive insurance companies. As a result of this intense competition, prevailing conditions relating to price, coverage and capacity can change very rapidly. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do and may be perceived as providing greater security to policyholders. There are low barriers to entry in the E&S lines insurance market, which is the primary market in which we operate, and competition in this market is fragmented and not dominated by one or more competitors. Competition in the E&S lines insurance industry is based on many factors, including price, policy terms and conditions, ratings by insurance agencies, overall financial strength of the insurer, services offered, reputation, agent and broker compensation and experience. We may face increased competition in the future in the insurance markets in which we operate, and any such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on us. Several E&S lines insurers and industry groups and associations currently offer alternative forms of risk protection in addition to traditional insurance products. These alternative products, including large deductible programs and various forms of self-insurance that use captive insurance companies and risk retention groups, have been instituted to allow for better control of risk management and costs. We cannot predict how continued growth in alternative forms of risk protection will affect our future operations. 22 Table of Contents Results in the insurance industry, and specifically the E&S lines insurance market, are subject to fluctuations and uncertainty which may adversely affect our ability to write policies. Historically, the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance industry has fluctuated in cyclical periods of price competition and excess underwriting capacity (known as a soft market) followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity (known as a hard market). Although an individual insurance companys financial performance is dependent on its own specific business characteristics, the profitability of most property and casualty insurance companies tends to follow this cyclical market pattern. Further, this cyclical market pattern can be more pronounced in the E&S lines market than in the standard insurance market due to greater flexibility in the E&S lines market to adjust rates to match market conditions. When the standard insurance market hardens, the E&S lines market hardens even more than the standard insurance market. During these hard market conditions, the standard insurance market writes less insurance and more customers must resort to the E&S lines market for insurance. As a result, the E&S lines market can grow more rapidly than the standard insurance market. Similarly, when conditions begin to soften, many customers that were previously driven into the E&S lines market may return to the standard insurance market, exacerbating the effects of rate decreases in the E&S lines market. Beginning in 2000 and accelerating in 2001, the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a hard market reflecting increasing rates, more restrictive coverage terms and more conservative risk selection. We believe that this trend continued through 2003. We believe that these trends slowed beginning in 2004 that the current insurance market has become more competitive in terms of pricing and policy terms and conditions. We are currently experiencing some downward pricing pressure. Because this cyclicality is due in large part to the actions of our competitors and general economic factors, we cannot predict the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle. These cyclical patterns have caused our revenues and net income to fluctuate and are expected to do so in the future. We are subject to extensive regulation, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation, primarily by insurance regulators in Illinois and Minnesota, the states in which our two insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled and, to a lesser degree, the other jurisdictions in which we operate. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders, as opposed to the interests of the insurance companies or their shareholders. These insurance regulations generally are administered by a department of insurance in each state and relate to, among other things, licensing, authorizations to write E&S lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, rate and form approvals, investment and underwriting limitations, affiliate transactions (which includes the review of services, tax sharing and other agreements with affiliates that can be a source of cash flow to us, other than dividends which are specifically regulated by law), dividend limitations, changes in control, solvency and a variety of other financial and non-financial aspects of our business. Significant changes in these laws and regulations could further limit our discretion to operate our business as we deem appropriate or make it more expensive to conduct our business. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory requirements may adversely affect our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. In addition, regulatory authorities have broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses or approvals for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In instances where there is uncertainty as to the applicability of regulations, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe generally to be followed by the insurance industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us. These actions could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Further, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry and changes in laws or regulations themselves or their interpretations by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. 23 Table of Contents If we have insufficient risk-based capital, our ability to conduct our business could be adversely affected. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, has adopted a system to test the adequacy of statutory capital, known as risk-based capital. This system establishes the minimum amount of risk-based capital necessary for a company to support its overall business operations. It identifies property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized by looking at certain inherent risks of each insurers assets and liabilities and its mix of net written premiums. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, including supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation. Failure to maintain our risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain regulatory authority to conduct our business. If our IRIS ratios are outside the usual range, our business could be adversely affected. Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, ratios are part of a collection of analytical tools designed to provide state insurance regulators with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. As of December 31, 2007, FMIC did not have any IRIS ratios outside the usual range and ANIC had IRIS ratios outside the usual range in only one of the IRIS tests. An insurance company may become subject to increased scrutiny when four or more of its IRIS ratios fall outside the range deemed usual by the NAIC. The nature of increased regulatory scrutiny resulting from IRIS ratios that are outside the usual range is subject to the judgment of the applicable state insurance department, but generally will result in accelerated review of annual and quarterly filings. Depending on the nature and severity of the underlying cause of the IRIS ratios being outside the usual range, increased regulatory scrutiny could range from increased but informal regulatory oversight to placing a company under regulatory control. FMIC has, in the past, had more than four ratios outside the usual range. If, in the future, FMIC has four or more ratios outside the usual range, we could become subject to greater scrutiny and oversight by regulatory authorities. See Insurance and Other Regulatory Matters. If we are unable to realize our investment objectives, our financial condition may be adversely affected. Our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio. The primary goals of our investment portfolio are to:  accumulate and preserve capital;  assure proper levels of liquidity;  optimize total after tax return subject to acceptable risk levels;  provide an acceptable and stable level of current income; and  approximate duration match between our investments and our liabilities. The ability to achieve our investment objectives is affected by general economic conditions that are beyond our control. General economic conditions can adversely affect the markets for interest rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in such markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and, consequently, the value of fixed income securities. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. General economic conditions, stock market conditions and many other factors can also adversely affect the equities markets and, consequently, the value of the equity securities we own. We may not be able to realize our investment objectives, which could reduce our net income significantly. Our directors and executive officers own a large percentage of our common stock, which allows them to effectively control matters requiring stockholder approval. Our directors and executive officers beneficially own 19.5% of our outstanding common stock (including options exercisable within 60 days) as of December 31, 2007, including 11.3% owned by Jerome Shaw, our founder and former Chief Executive Officer. Accordingly, these directors and executive officers will have substantial influence, if they act as a group, over the election of directors and the outcome of other corporate actions requiring 24 Table of Contents stockholder approval and could seek to arrange a sale of our company at a time or under conditions that are not favorable to our other stockholders. These stockholders may also delay or prevent a change of control, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders, if they act as a group. This significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. We rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems, and the failure of these systems could adversely affect our business. Our business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems. We rely on these systems to process new and renewal business, provide customer service, make claims payments, facilitate collections and cancellations and to share data across our organization. These systems also enable us to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for underwriting and rate development. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third party software license on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations or materially impact our ability to evaluate and write new business. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business and provide customer service or compromise our ability to pay claims in a timely manner. Our third party governmental entities risk-sharing pooling administration business is concentrated among a limited number of pools and the termination of any single contract for this business could significantly reduce the profitability of this business. We own and manage a third party governmental entities risk-sharing pooling administration business through ARPCO. Each pool is composed of public entity members (such as cities, townships, counties, etc.) that have joined together by means of an intergovernmental contract to pool their insurance risk and provide related insurance services to its members. The pooling is authorized by state statute or as noted in the enabling legislation. Pooling provides a risk sharing alternative to the traditional purchase of commercial insurance. The governmental risk-sharing pools that we provide services for are located in the Midwest. ARPCO currently has multi-year contracts with five risk-sharing pools and the termination or non-renewal of any single contract for this business would significantly reduce the profitability of this business. Risks Related to our Common Stock The price of our shares of common stock may be volatile. The trading price of shares of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. The price of the shares of our common stock that will prevail in the market may be higher or lower than prices paid by investors, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause investors to lose part or all of their investment in shares of our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations include, but are not limited to, the following:  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of insurers securities;  actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts;  general economic conditions and trends;  losses in our insured portfolio;  sales of large blocks of shares of our common stock; or  departures of key personnel. 25 Table of Contents Our results of operations and revenues may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance industry, which may cause the price of our shares to decline. The results of operations of companies in the insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. Our profitability can be affected significantly by:  the differences between actual and expected losses that we cannot reasonably anticipate using historical loss data and other identifiable factors at the time we price our products;  volatile and unpredictable developments, including man-made, weather-related and other natural catastrophes or terrorist attacks, or court grants of large awards for particular damages;  changes in the amount of loss reserves resulting from new types of claims and new or changing judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liabilities; and  fluctuations in equity markets, interest rates, credit risk and foreign currency exposure, inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment, which affect returns on invested assets and may impact the ultimate payout of losses. In addition, the demand for the types of insurance we will offer can vary significantly, rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as that activity decreases, causing our revenues to fluctuate. These fluctuations in results of operations and revenues may cause the price of our securities to be volatile. If a substantial number of our shares of common stock become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our shares of common stock could decline. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our shares of common stock in the public market, the market price of our shares of common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell our shares of common stock could also depress our market price. The market price of our shares of common stock may drop significantly. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities. We do not currently intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock to our stockholders and any determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. We currently intend to retain any profits to provide capacity to write insurance and to accumulate reserves and surplus for the payment of claims. Our board of directors does not intend to declare cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends to our stockholders in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Consequently, it is uncertain when, if ever, we will declare dividends to our stockholders. If we do not pay dividends, investors will only obtain a return on their investment if the value of our shares of common stock appreciates. We conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Our status as a holding company and a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries affects our ability to pay dividends and make other payments. Our principal source of funds is dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries. Therefore, our ability to pay dividends depends largely on our subsidiaries earnings and operating capital requirements and is subject to the regulatory, contractual, rating agency and other constraints of our subsidiaries, including the effect of any such dividends or distributions on the A.M. Best rating or other ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. Our two insurance subsidiaries are limited by regulation in their ability to pay dividends. For example, during 2008, FMIC and ANIC may pay in the aggregate dividends to FMFC of up to $19.0 million without regulatory approval. In addition, the terms of our borrowing arrangements may limit our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders. 26 Table of Contents Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could prevent or delay transactions that stockholders may favor and entrench current management. We are incorporated in Delaware. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware corporate law, contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable, including a provision that authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such voting rights, dividend rates, liquidation, redemption, conversion and other rights as our board of directors may fix and without further stockholder action. The issuance of preferred stock with voting rights could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. This could frustrate a change in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in entrenchment of current management. Takeover attempts generally include offering stockholders a premium for their stock. Therefore, preventing a takeover attempt may cause you to lose an opportunity to sell your shares at a premium. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline. Delaware law also prohibits a corporation from engaging in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, the board of directors approves the transaction. This provision may prevent changes in our management or corporate structure. Also, under applicable Delaware law, our board of directors is permitted to and may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future. Our bylaws provide for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered three year terms. The classification of our board of directors could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. We are required to evaluate our internal control under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and could have an adverse effect on our stock price. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Such report contains, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. Each year we must prepare or update the process documentation and perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. During this process, if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the future (or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.
