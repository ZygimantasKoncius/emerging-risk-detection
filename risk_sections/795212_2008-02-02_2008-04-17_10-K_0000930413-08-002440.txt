Item 1A. RISK FACTORS The following is a discussion of certain factors, which could affect the financial results of the Company. The Companys results of operations are affected by the availability of new products. The Companys business is affected by the release of hit music, video and video game titles, which can create fluctuations in sales. It is not possible to determine the timing of these fluctuations or the future availability of hit titles. The Company is dependent upon the major music and movie producers to continue to produce hit products. To the extent that new hit releases are not available, or not available at prices attractive to consumers, or, if manufacturers fail to introduce or delay the introduction of new products, the Companys results of operations may be adversely affected. The Companys results of operations may suffer if the Company does not accurately predict consumer acceptance of new product or distribution technologies. The entertainment industry is characterized by changing technology, evolving format standards, frequent new and enhanced product introductions and rapid product obsolescence. These characteristics require that the Company respond quickly to technological changes and understand the impact of these changes on customers preferences. If the Company is unable to participate in new product or distribution technologies, its results of operations may suffer. Increased competition from existing retailers and alternative distribution channels may adversely affect the Companys results of operations. The Company competes with a wide variety of entertainment retailers, including deep-discount retailers, mass merchandisers, consumer electronics outlets, internet retailers, record clubs and independent operators, some of which have greater financial and other resources than the Company. The Company also expects continued growth in competing home entertainment options. Some of these, including the ability to download music, video and video games onto PCs or other devices, or the ability to play video games over the Internet through consoles, could reduce retail sales of CDs, DVDs and video games. If technological advances were to result in significant changes in existing distribution channels for pre-recorded music, video and video games, the Companys results of operations could be adversely affected. A decline in general economic condition, including declines in current levels of consumer spending could adversely affect results of operations. The Companys results of operations are affected by the level of consumer spending, which reflects the general state of local economies in which the Company operates. Changes in consumer preference or discretionary consumer spending could harm our business. The Companys operating results fluctuate from period to period. As is the case with many retailers, a significant portion of the Companys sales are generated in the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. Less than satisfactory sales for such period could have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. Growth Strategy  the failure to grow the Companys business may limit its earnings. Historically, the Companys growth has come from the opening of new stores and the acquisition of stores. The Company opens new stores if it finds desirable locations and is able to negotiate suitable lease terms. A lack of new store growth may impact the Companys ability to increase sales and earnings. A change in one or more of the Companys vendors policies or the Companys relationship with those vendors could adversely affect the Companys results of operations. The majority of the Companys purchases come from ten major suppliers. As is standard in its industry, the Company does not maintain long-term contracts with its suppliers but instead makes purchases on an order-by-order basis. If the Company fails to maintain customary trade terms or enjoy positive vendor relations, it could have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. If the Companys vendors fail to provide marketing and merchandising support at historical levels, the Companys results of operations could be adversely affected. The manufacturers of entertainment products have typically provided retailers with significant marketing and merchandising support for their products. As part of this support, the Company receives cooperative advertising and other allowances from these vendors. These allowances enable the Company to actively promote and merchandise the products it sells at its stores and on its websites. If the Companys vendors fail to provide this support at historical levels, the Companys results of operations could be negatively impacted. Loss of Key Personnel could adversely affect the Companys results of operations. The Company believes that its future prospects depend to a significant extent on the services of its executive officers, as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified key personnel. The loss of the services of certain of the Companys executive officers and other key management personnel could adversely affect the Companys results of operations. 7 Control by and Dependence on Key Personnel - Robert J. Higgins has a significant influence on the outcome of any vote of the Companys Shareholders and if the Company were to lose his services, it may not be able to replace his skills and experience. Robert J. Higgins serves as Chairman of the Board of the Company and its Chief Executive Officer and owns approximately 40.1% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, as of February 2, 2008. Future decreases in liquidity may adversely affect the Companys results of operations. Management is not currently aware of any trends, uncertainties or other significant events that would cause liquidity to decrease or increase in a material way. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that the Company will be able to maintain its ability to borrow under its revolving credit facility. The Company does not expect any material changes in the mix (between equity and debt) or the relative cost of capital resources. Anti-takeover provisions  New York anti-takeover law provisions and the classified Board Amendment may discourage unsolicited takeovers. In August 2000, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a Classified Board Amendment which together with anti-takeover provisions eschewed by New York State Law may discourage open market purchases or a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for the stock of the Company. This may be adverse to the interests of certain shareholders. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED SEC COMMENTS The Company has not received within 180 days or more before February 2, 2008, written comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding its periodic or current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that remain unresolved. 8
