Audit committee pre-approval is required for all non-audit services to be performed by our independent auditors. For additional information on our Audit Committee, see “Item 16A: Audit Committee Financial Expert,” and “Item 16C: Principal Accountant Fees and Services.” Compensation Committee Henrik Kjellberg (who serves as chairman), Thomas Gurnee and Johan Svanstrom are currently the members of our compensation committee. Mr. Kjellberg and Mr. Svanstrom were appointed by Expedia under an Investors Agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific and certain other shareholders dated July 23, 2004 (the “Investors Agreement”).

In addition, the compensation committee approves bonus and stock compensation arrangements for all of our employees. Under the Investors Agreement, Expedia has the right to appoint two directors to the compensation committee, and the compensation committee does not have the authority to approve the issuance of equity compensation unless two directors nominated by Expedia are on the compensation committee. Executive Committee In August 2011, our Board of Directors established an Executive Committee which is currently comprised of Guangfu Cui, Thomas Gurnee and Henrik Kjellberg. Acting on behalf of the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee has all power and authority of the Board of Directors, except for (i) powers reserved for the Audit Committee or Compensation Committee under applicable law or contract or (ii) matters requiring consent of TCH Sapphire under the Investor Rights Agreement entered into among TCH Sapphire, Expedia Asia Pacific and eLong in May 2011.

Duties of Directors Under Cayman Islands law, each of our directors has a duty of loyalty to act honestly, in good faith and with a view to the best interests of our company and for a proper purpose. Our directors also have a duty to exercise the skills that they actually possess and such care and diligence that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. Our directors must ensure compliance with our company’s memorandum of association and articles of association. A shareholder may have the right to seek damages on behalf of our company if a duty owed by our directors to our company is breached. Limitation on Liability and Other Indemnification Matters Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our articles of association provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors for losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred in their capacities as such, but the indemnity does not extend to any matter in respect of any willful neglect or intentional malfeasance which may be attached to such person. 57 Compensation of Senior Management and Directors We paid aggregate cash compensation of US$0.3 million to our non-employee directors in 2012.

Share Ownership Please refer to “Item 7: Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions” and to “Equity Compensation Plans and Grants” below. Equity Compensation Plans and Grants We have adopted three equity compensation plans: the eLong, Inc. Stock Option Plan, adopted in April 2001 (the “2001 Plan”), the eLong, Inc. Stock and Annual Incentive Plan, adopted in July 2004 (the “2004 Plan”), and the eLong, Inc. 2009 Share and Annual Incentive Plan (the “2009 Plan”). Each equity compensation plan is discussed below. Under the 2001 Plan, we have granted options to purchase our ordinary shares, of which 14,336 options granted to our current employees are outstanding, and have not been exercised, as of March 31, 2013. These options were granted on January 1, 2004 and are fully vested and exercisable. We currently do not intend to issue any additional equity grants under the 2001 Plan. 58 Under the 2004 Plan, we have reserved an aggregate of 4,000,000 of our ordinary shares for issuance, and have granted stock options and performance units to our employees, directors and consultants. As of March 31, 2013, 336,728 stock options and 105,709 performance units were outstanding under the 2004 Plan. Stock options granted under the 2004 Plan generally expire ten years after the grant date. We currently do not intend to issue any additional equity grants under the 2004 Plan. Under the 2009 Plan, as amended, we have reserved an aggregate of 12,000,000 of our ordinary shares for issuance. As of March 31, 2013, 2,839,670 stock options and 1,814,811 performance units issued to our current employees and directors were outstanding and had not been exercised under the 2009 Plan. The 2009 Plan was adopted by our Board of Directors on May 13, 2009, was amended to allow grants to our Directors and approved by our shareholders on December 30, 2009, was amended by our Board of Directors on March 17, 2011 to increase the total number of authorized shares from 3,000,000 to 6,000,000, and was amended by our Board of Directors on April 24, 2012 to increase the total number of authorized shares to 12,000,000. Under the 2009 Plan, the Compensation Committee or Board of Directors may grant stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares or performance units to our employees, directors, officers or consultants. The terms of the 2009 Plan differ from those of the 2004 Plan in some respects, including but not limited to, the following: • Upon the occurrence of a “change in control,” the 2009 Plan provides for immediate vesting of the then outstanding options or other equity grants under the 2009 Plan to employees with the rank of Vice President or above; and • Within two years following the date of a change of control, if the employment of a recipient of an award under the 2009 Plan is terminated or resigns for “good reason” (as defined under the 2009 Plan), such employee’s options and other equity grants would vest. Change of control is defined in the 2009 Plan to include (i) the acquisition or control of the majority of our voting power by a person or group other than Barry Diller, Liberty Media, Expedia and their respective affiliates; (ii) announcement by a person of a going private transaction or other transaction which will result in our ordinary shares or ADSs no longer being publicly listed; and (iii) certain other types of business combinations or sales or dispositions of the majority of our assets. Under the terms of the relevant stock option agreements, the grants we made to our employees on March 9, 2010, March 7, 2011 and February 27, 2012 do not immediately vest upon the announcement by a person of a going private transaction or other transaction which will result in our ordinary shares or ADSs no longer being publicly listed. The following table summarizes, as of March 31, 2013, the unvested and outstanding stock options granted under our equity compensation plans. Unless otherwise noted below, the stock options are fully vested and exercisable.

(2) Vests over a three-year period with one-third vesting on each of the second, third and fourth anniversary of the grant date. (3) Vests over a four-year period with one-half vesting on each of the third and fourth anniversary of the grant date. (4) Vests on the second anniversary of the grant date. 59 Performance units are awards in the form of units that are denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of our ordinary shares, which number of units are determined based on the fair market value of our ordinary shares. At the time of grant, our board of directors or the compensation committee determines if we will settle the performance units in cash, stock or both. Performance units granted to our employees are settled in ordinary shares; performance units granted to our non-employee directors are settled upon vesting in cash in an amount equal to the number of the vested performance units multiplied by the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the applicable vesting date. The fair market value of the performance units is determined based upon the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares on the trading date immediately preceding the grant date for awards made under the 2004 Plan, and the grant date (or if the grant date is not a trading day then the immediately preceding trading date) for awards made under the 2009 Plan. Our performance units are subject to service-based vesting where a specific period of continued employment must pass before the performance units are vested. On December 3, 2012, we enacted a voluntary program which allowed certain employees to exchange certain stock options which were previously vested or expected to vest in 2012, 2013 or 2014, for a lesser number of new performance units at a ratio of 1 option to 0.8 performance units. The new performance units were granted under the 2009 Plan, and vest semi-annually over 2 years from the grant date (25% every six-months).
