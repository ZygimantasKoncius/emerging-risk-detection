Risk Factors For purposes of this section, the term stockholders means the holders of shares of our common stock and our preferred stock. Risks Related to Our Properties, Our Business and Our Growth Strategy Because we lease our properties to a limited number of tenants, and to the extent we depend on a limited number of tenants in the future, the inability of any single tenant to make its lease payments could adversely affect our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2007, we had 117 tenants in 67 total properties. Two of our tenants, Human Genome Sciences and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, represented 20.3% and 13.1%, respectively, of our annualized base rent as of December 31, 2007, and 10.9% and 8.1%, respectively, of our total leased rentable square footage. While we evaluate the creditworthiness of our tenants by reviewing available financial and other pertinent information, there can be no assurance that any tenant will be able to make timely rental payments or avoid defaulting under its lease. If a tenant defaults, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. Because we depend on rental payments from a limited number of tenants, the inability of any single tenant to make its lease payments could adversely affect us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We may be unable to acquire, develop or operate new properties successfully, which could harm our financial condition and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 8 Table of Contents We continue to evaluate the market for available properties and may acquire office, laboratory and other properties when opportunities exist. We also may develop or substantially renovate office and other properties. Acquisition, development and renovation activities are subject to significant risks, including:  changing market conditions, including competition from others, may diminish our opportunities for acquiring a desired property on favorable terms or at all. Even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of properties, these agreements are subject to customary conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction,  we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms (or at all),  we may spend more time or money than we budget to improve or renovate acquired properties or to develop new properties,  we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new properties, particularly if we acquire portfolios of properties, into our existing operations,  we may fail to obtain the financial results expected from the properties we acquire or develop, making them unprofitable or less profitable than we had expected,  market and economic conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates,  we may fail to retain tenants that have pre-leased our properties under development if we do not complete the construction of these properties in a timely manner or to the tenants specifications,  we have a limited history in conducting ground-up construction activities,  if we develop properties, we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations,  acquired and developed properties may have defects we do not discover through our inspection processes, including latent defects that may not reveal themselves until many years after we put a property in service, and  we may acquire land, properties or entities owning properties, which are subject to liabilities and for which, in the case of unknown liabilities, we may have limited or no recourse. As of December 31, 2007, five of the properties we owned or had interests in were under development, constituting approximately 1.9 million square feet. As a result of these projects, we may face increased risk with respect to our development activities. The realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our securities, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. Tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect their ability to pay us rent and consequently adversely affect our business. Life science entities comprise the vast majority of our tenant base. Because of our dependence on a single industry, adverse conditions affecting that industry will more adversely affect our business, and thus our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, than if our business strategy included a more diverse tenant base. Life science industry tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing drugs and drug delivery technologies, fail from time to time as a result of various factors. Many of these factors are particular to the life science industry. For example:  Our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research and development and clinical testing of their products and technologies. If private investors, the government, public markets or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such development, a tenants business may fail. 9 Table of Contents  The research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants products require federal, state and foreign regulatory approvals. The approval process is typically long, expensive and uncertain. Even if our tenants have sufficient funds to seek approvals, one or all of their products may fail to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. Furthermore, our tenants may only have a small number of products under development. If one product fails to receive the required approvals at any stage of development, it could significantly adversely affect our tenants entire business and its ability to pay rent.  Our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by health care reform efforts and the reimbursement policies of government or private health care payers.  Our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws. Failure to do so could jeopardize their ability to profit from their efforts and to protect their products from competition.  Collaborative relationships with other life science entities may be crucial to the development, manufacturing, distribution or marketing of our tenants products. If these other entities fail to fulfill their obligations under these collaborative arrangements, our tenants businesses will suffer. We cannot assure you that our tenants in the life science industry will be successful in their businesses. If our tenants businesses are adversely affected, they may have difficulty paying us rent. Because particular upgrades are required for life science tenants, improvements to our properties involve greater expenditures than traditional office space, which costs may not be covered by the rents our tenants pay. The improvements generally required for our properties infrastructure are more costly than for other property types. Typical infrastructural improvements include the following:  reinforced concrete floors,  upgraded roof structures for greater load capacity,  increased floor-to-ceiling clear heights,  heavy-duty HVAC systems,  enhanced environmental control technology,  significantly upgraded electrical, gas and plumbing infrastructure, and  laboratory benchwork. Our tenants generally pay higher rent on our properties than tenants in traditional office space. However, we cannot assure you that our tenants will continue to do so in the future or that the rents paid will cover the additional costs of upgrading the properties. Because of the unique and specific improvements required for our life science tenants, we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make our properties suitable for other life science tenants or other office tenants, which could adversely affect our operating performance. We acquire or develop properties that include laboratory space and other features that we believe are generally desirable for life science industry tenants. However, different life science industry tenants may require different features in their properties, depending on each tenants particular focus within the life science industry. If a current tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a property, we may incur substantial expenditures to modify the property before we are able to re-lease the space to another life science industry tenant. This could hurt our operating performance and the value of your investment. Also, if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple tenants, we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to re-lease the space. 10 Table of Contents Additionally, our properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office tenants without significant expenditures or renovations. Accordingly, any downturn in the life science industry may have a substantial negative impact on our properties values. The geographic concentration of our consolidated properties in Boston, Maryland and California makes our business particularly vulnerable to adverse conditions affecting these markets. Twelve of our properties are located in the Boston area. As of December 31, 2007, these properties represented 24.6% of our annualized base rent and 15.4% of our total rentable square footage. Five of our properties are located in Maryland. As of December 31, 2007, these properties represented 22.3% of our annualized base rent and 13.5% of our total rentable square footage. In addition, 26 of our properties are located in California, with 15 in San Diego and eleven in San Francisco. As of December 31, 2007, these properties represented 24.7% of our annualized base rent and 42.6% of our total rentable square footage. Because of this concentration in three geographic regions, we are particularly vulnerable to adverse conditions affecting Boston, Maryland and California, including general economic conditions, increased competition, a downturn in the local life science industry, real estate conditions, terrorist attacks, earthquakes and wildfires and other natural disasters occurring in these regions. In addition, we cannot assure you that these markets will continue to grow or remain favorable to the life science industry. The performance of the life science industry and the economy in general in these geographic markets may affect occupancy, market rental rates and expenses, and thus may affect our performance and the value of our properties. We are also subject to greater risk of loss from earthquakes or wildfires because of our properties concentration in California. The close proximity of our eleven properties in San Francisco to a fault line makes them more vulnerable to earthquakes than properties in many other parts of the country. In addition, the wildfires occurring in the San Diego area, most recently in 2003 and in 2007, may make the 15 properties we own in the San Diego area more vulnerable to fire damage or destruction than properties in many other parts of the country. Our tax indemnification and debt maintenance obligations require us to make payments if we sell certain properties or repay certain debt, which could limit our operating flexibility. In our formation transactions, certain of our executive officers, Alan D. Gold, Gary A. Kreitzer, John F. Wilson, II and Matthew G. McDevitt, and certain other individuals contributed six properties to our Operating Partnership. If we were to dispose of these contributed assets in a taxable transaction, Messrs. Gold, Kreitzer, Wilson and McDevitt and the other contributors of those assets would suffer adverse tax consequences. In connection with these contribution transactions, we agreed to indemnify those contributors against such adverse tax consequences for a period of ten years. This indemnification will help those contributors to preserve their tax positions after their contributions. The tax indemnification provisions were not negotiated in an arms length transaction but were determined by our management team. We have also agreed to use reasonable best efforts consistent with our fiduciary duties to maintain at least $8.0 million of debt, some of which must be property specific, that the contributors can guarantee in order to defer any taxable gain they may incur if our Operating Partnership repays existing debt. These tax indemnification and debt maintenance obligations may affect the way in which we conduct our business. During the indemnification period, these obligations may impact the timing and circumstances under which we sell the contributed properties or interests in entities holding the properties. For example, these tax indemnification payments could effectively reduce or eliminate any gain we might otherwise realize upon the sale or other disposition of the related properties. Accordingly, even if market conditions might otherwise dictate that it would be desirable to dispose of these properties, the existence of the tax indemnification obligations could result in a decision to retain the properties in our portfolio to avoid having to pay the tax indemnity payments. The existence of the debt maintenance obligations could require us to maintain debt at a higher level than we might otherwise choose. Higher debt levels could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. While we may seek to enter into tax-efficient joint ventures with third-party investors, we currently have no intention of disposing of these properties or interests in entities holding the properties in transactions that would trigger our tax indemnification obligations. The involuntary condemnation of one or more of these properties during the indemnification period could, however, trigger the tax indemnification obligations described above. The tax indemnity would equal the amount of the federal and state income tax liability the contributor would incur with respect to the gain allocated to the contributor. The calculation of the indemnity payment would not be reduced due 11 Table of Contents to the time value of money or the time remaining within the indemnification period. The terms of the contribution agreements also require us to gross up the tax indemnity payment for the amount of income taxes due as a result of the tax indemnity payment. Messrs. Gold, Kreitzer, Wilson and McDevitt are potential recipients of these indemnification payments. Because of these potential payments their personal interests may diverge from those of our stockholders. Our expansion strategy may not yield the returns expected, may result in disruptions to our business, may strain our management resources and may adversely affect our operations. We own properties principally in Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York/New Jersey, each of which is currently a leading market in the United States for the life science industry. We cannot assure you that these markets will remain favorable to the life science industry, that these markets will continue to grow or that we will be successful expanding in these markets. In addition to the 13 properties we acquired in connection with our initial public offering in August 2004, as of December 31, 2007, we had acquired or had acquired an interest in an additional 54 properties (net of property dispositions), and we expect to continue to expand. This anticipated growth will require substantial attention from our existing management team, which may divert managements attention from our current properties. Implementing our growth plan will also require that we expand our management and staff with qualified and experienced personnel and that we implement administrative, accounting and operational systems sufficient to integrate new properties into our portfolio. We also must manage future property acquisitions without incurring unanticipated costs or disrupting the operations at our existing properties. Managing new properties requires a focus on leasing and retaining tenants. If we fail to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our portfolio, or if newly acquired properties fail to perform as we expect, our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions could suffer. Our success depends on key personnel with extensive experience dealing with the real estate needs of life science tenants, and the loss of these key personnel could threaten our ability to operate our business successfully. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, on the continued services of our management team. In particular, we depend on the efforts of Mr. Gold, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kreitzer, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Mr. Wilson, our Executive Vice President, Mr. McDevitt, our Regional Executive Vice President, and Mr. Griffin, our Chief Financial Officer. Among the reasons that Messrs. Gold, Kreitzer, Wilson, McDevitt and Griffin are important to our success are that they have extensive real estate and finance experience, and strong reputations within the life science industry. Our management team has developed informal relationships through past business dealings with numerous members of the scientific community, life science investors, current and prospective life science industry tenants, and real estate brokers. We expect that their reputations will continue to attract business and investment opportunities before the active marketing of properties and will assist us in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential tenants, and industry personnel. If we lost their services, our relationships with such lenders, existing and prospective tenants, and industry personnel could suffer. We have entered into employment agreements with each of Messrs. Gold, Kreitzer, Wilson, McDevitt and Griffin, but we cannot guarantee that they will not terminate their employment prior to the end of the term. The bankruptcy of a tenant may adversely affect the income produced by and the value of our properties. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. If any tenant becomes a debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict the tenant solely because of the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court also might authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us, which would generally result in any unpaid, pre-bankruptcy rent being treated as an unsecured claim. In addition, our claim against the tenant for unpaid, future rent would be subject to a statutory cap equal to the greater of (1) one year of rent or (2) 15% of the remaining rent on the lease (not to exceed three years of rent). This cap might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease. Additionally, a Bankruptcy Court may require us to turn over to the estate all or a portion of any deposits, amounts in escrow, or prepaid rents. Our claim for 12 Table of Contents unpaid, pre-bankruptcy rent, our lease termination damages and claims relating to damages for which we hold deposits or other amounts that we were forced to repay would likely not be paid in full. Future acts of terrorism or war or the risk of war may have a negative impact on our business. The continued threat of terrorism and the potential for military action and heightened security measures in response to this threat may cause significant disruption to commerce. There can be no assurance that the armed hostilities will not escalate or that these terrorist attacks, or the United States responses to them, will not lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances, which may further contribute to economic instability. Any armed conflict, civil unrest or additional terrorist activities, and the attendant political instability and societal disruption, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and future growth. Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry Significant competition may decrease or prevent increases in our properties occupancy and rental rates and may reduce our investment opportunities. We face competition from various entities for investment opportunities in properties for life science tenants, including other REITs, such as health care REITs and suburban office property REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships, and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic location of its investments. In the future, competition from these entities may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us or increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. Further, as a result of their greater resources, those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract tenants. This could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock or preferred stock, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected. Uninsured and underinsured losses could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We carry comprehensive general liability, fire and extended coverage, terrorism and loss of rental income insurance covering all of our properties under a blanket portfolio policy, with the exception of property insurance on our McKellar Court, Science Center Drive, 9911 Belward Campus Drive and Shady Grove Road locations, which is carried directly by the tenants in accordance with the terms of their respective leases, and builders risk policies for any projects under construction. In addition, we carry workers compensation coverage for injury to our employees. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are adequate given the relative risk of loss, cost of the coverage and standard industry practice. We also carry environmental remediation insurance for our properties. This insurance, subject to certain exclusions and deductibles, covers the cost to remediate environmental damage caused by unintentional future spills or the historic presence of previously undiscovered hazardous substances, as well as third-party bodily injury and property damage claims related to the release of hazardous substances. We intend to carry similar insurance with respect to future acquisitions as appropriate. A substantial portion of our properties are located in areas subject to earthquake loss, such as San Diego and San Francisco, California and Seattle, Washington. Although we presently carry earthquake insurance on our properties, the amount of earthquake insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to fully cover losses from earthquakes. In addition, we may discontinue earthquake, terrorism or other insurance, or may elect not to procure such insurance, on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of the premiums for any of these policies exceeds, in our judgment, the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged. 13 Table of Contents Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate assets and with factors affecting the real estate industry. Our ability to make expected distributions to our stockholders depends on our ability to generate revenues in excess of expenses, our scheduled principal payments on debt and our capital expenditure requirements. Events and conditions that are beyond our control may decrease our cash available for distribution and the value of our properties. These events include:  local oversupply, increased competition or reduced demand for life science office and laboratory space,  inability to collect rent from tenants,  vacancies or our inability to rent space on favorable terms,  increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes,  the ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older structures,  unanticipated delays in the completion of our development or redevelopment projects,  costs of complying with changes in governmental regulations, including tax laws,  the relative illiquidity of real estate investments,  changing submarket demographics, and  civil unrest, acts of war and natural disasters, including earthquakes, floods and fires, which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses. In addition, we could experience a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults under existing leases if any of the following occur:  periods of economic slowdown or recession,  rising interest rates,  declining demand for real estate, or  the public perception that any of these events may occur. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock or preferred stock, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. Illiquidity of real estate investments may make it difficult for us to sell properties in response to market conditions and could harm our financial condition and ability to make distributions. Equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore will tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic or other conditions. To the extent the properties are not subject to triple-net leases, some significant expenditures such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment. Should these events occur, our income and funds available for distribution could be adversely affected. If any of the parking leases or licenses associated with our Cambridge portfolio were to expire, or if we were unable to assign these leases to a buyer, it would be more difficult for us to sell these properties and would adversely affect our ability to retain current tenants or attract new tenants at these properties. In addition, as a REIT, we may be subject to a 100% tax on net income derived from the sale of property considered to be held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business. We may seek to avoid this tax by complying with certain safe harbor rules that generally limit the number of properties we may sell in a given year, the aggregate expenditures made on such properties prior to their disposition, and how long we retain such properties before disposing of them. However, we can provide no assurance that we will always be able to comply with these safe harbors. If compliance is possible, the safe harbor rules may restrict our ability to sell assets in the future and achieve liquidity that may be necessary to fund distributions. 14 Table of Contents We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire, which could adversely affect our business and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. If we cannot renew leases, we may be unable to re-lease our properties at rates equal to or above the current rate. Even if we can renew leases, tenants may be able to negotiate lower rates as a result of market conditions. Market conditions may also hinder our ability to lease vacant space in newly developed properties. In addition, we may enter into or acquire leases for properties that are specially suited to the needs of a particular tenant. Such properties may require renovations, tenant improvements or other concessions in order to lease them to other tenants if the initial leases terminate. Any of these factors could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock or preferred stock, our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. We could incur significant costs related to government regulation and private litigation over environmental matters involving the presence, discharge or threat of discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, which could adversely affect our operations, the value of our properties, and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Our properties may be subject to environmental liabilities. Under various federal, state and local laws, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant of real estate can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence, discharge or threat of discharge of hazardous or toxic substances. Liabilities can include the cost to investigate, clean up and monitor the actual or threatened contamination and damages caused by the contamination (or threatened contamination). Environmental laws typically impose such liability on the current owner regardless of:  the owners knowledge of the contamination,  the timing of the contamination,  the cause of the contamination, or  the party responsible for the contamination. The liability under such laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we may be liable regardless of whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the government entity or private party may seek recovery of the entire amount from us even if there are other responsible parties. Liabilities associated with environmental conditions may be significant and can sometimes exceed the value of the affected property. The presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent that property or to borrow using that property as collateral. Some of our properties have had contamination in the past that required cleanup. In most cases, we believe the contamination has been effectively remediated, and that any remaining contamination either does not require remediation or that the costs associated with such remediation will not be material to us. However, we cannot guarantee that additional contamination will not be discovered in the future or any identified contamination will not continue to pose a threat to the environment or that we will not have continued liability in connection with such prior contamination. Our 675 West Kendall and 500 Kendall Street properties are located on the site of a former manufactured gas plant. Various remedial actions were performed on these properties, including soil stabilization to control the spread of oil and hazardous materials in the soil. Another of our properties, Elliott Avenue, has known soil contamination beneath a portion of the building located on the property. Based on environmental consultant reports, management does not believe any remediation of the Elliott Avenue property would be required unless major structural changes were made to the building that resulted in the soil becoming exposed. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of certain properties through our investment in limited liability companies with PREI, PREI II LLC assumed an obligation related to the remediation of environmental conditions at off-site parcels located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. PREI II LLC has estimated the costs of the remediation to be $3.6 million, but we cannot provide any assurance that the actual remediation costs will not be higher than this estimate. We do not expect these matters to materially adversely affect such properties value or the cash flows related to such properties, but we can provide no assurances to that effect. 15 Table of Contents Environmental laws also:  may require the removal or upgrade of underground storage tanks,  regulate the discharge of storm water, wastewater and other pollutants,  regulate air pollutant emissions,  regulate hazardous materials generation, management and disposal, and  regulate workplace health and safety. Life science industry tenants, our primary tenant industry focus, frequently use hazardous materials, chemicals, heavy metals, and biological and radioactive compounds. Our tenants controlled use of these materials subjects us and our tenants to laws that govern using, manufacturing, storing, handling and disposing of such materials and certain byproducts of those materials. We are unaware of any of our existing tenants violating applicable laws and regulations, but we and our tenants cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. If our properties become contaminated, or if a party is injured, we could be held liable for any damages that result. Such liability could exceed our resources and any environmental remediation insurance coverage we have, which could adversely affect our operations, the value of our properties, and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Licensing requirements governing use of radioactive materials by tenants may also restrict the use of or ability to transfer space in buildings we own. We could incur significant costs related to governmental regulation and private litigation over environmental matters involving asbestos-containing materials, which could adversely affect our operations, the value of our properties, and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos-containing materials, or ACMs, and may impose fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with these laws, or even the presence of ACMs, may expose us to third-party liability. Some of our properties contain ACMs, and we could be liable for such fines or penalties, as described above in Item 1. Business  Regulation  Environmental Matters. Our properties may contain or develop harmful mold, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating the problem, which could adversely affect the value of the affected property and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing because exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property. In addition, the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability to our tenants, their or our employees, and others if property damage or health concerns arise. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws may require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures. All of our properties are required to comply with the ADA. The ADA requires that all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Although we believe that our properties substantially comply with present requirements of the ADA, we have not conducted an audit of all of such properties to determine compliance. If one or more properties are not in compliance with the ADA, then we would be required to bring the offending properties into compliance. Compliance with the ADA could require removing access barriers. Non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. Additional federal, state and local laws also may require us to modify properties or could restrict our ability to renovate properties. Complying with the ADA or other legislation could be very expensive. If we incur substantial costs to comply with such laws, our financial condition, results of operations, 16 Table of Contents cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock or preferred stock, our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. We may incur significant unexpected costs to comply with fire, safety and other regulations, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and ability to make distributions. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and safety requirements, building codes and land use regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to governmental fines or private litigant damage awards. We believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements. However, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the per share trading price of our common stock or preferred stock, our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. Risks Related to Our Capital Structure Debt obligations expose us to increased risk of property losses and may have adverse consequences on our business operations and our ability to make distributions. We have used and will continue to use debt to finance property acquisitions. Our use of debt may have adverse consequences, including the following:  Required payments of principal and interest may be greater than our cash flow from operations.  We may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms, to make payments on our debt.  If we default on our debt obligations, the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure those loans. Further, if we default under a mortgage loan, we will automatically be in default on any other loan that has cross-default provisions, and we may lose the properties securing all of these loans.  A foreclosure on one of our properties will be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the secured debt. If the outstanding balance of the secured debt exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure without realizing any accompanying cash proceeds to pay the tax (or to make distributions based on REIT taxable income).  We may not be able to refinance or extend our existing debt. If we cannot repay, refinance or extend our debt at maturity, in addition to our failure to repay our debt, we may be unable to make distributions to our stockholders at expected levels or at all.  Even if we are able to refinance or extend our existing debt, the terms of any refinancing or extension may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If the refinancing involves a higher interest rate, it could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to stockholders. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of $368.8 million, excluding $10.9 million of debt premium; $250 million of borrowings under our secured term loan, secured by 14 of our properties; $2.2 million of mortgage indebtedness and $83.3 million of borrowings under a secured loan representing our proportionate share of indebtedness at our unconsolidated partnerships; $175 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026; $270.9 million in outstanding borrowings under our $600 million unsecured line of credit; and $425.2 million in outstanding borrowings under our $550 million secured construction loan, which is secured by our Center for Life Science | Boston property. We expect to incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of debt that we may incur. 17 Table of Contents Recent disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us. The U.S. credit markets have recently experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive, and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. Continued uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms (or at all), which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund current and future development and redevelopment projects. In addition, the financial position of the lenders under our credit facilities may worsen to the point that they default on their obligations to make available to us the funds under those facilities. A prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. These events in the credit markets have also had an adverse effect on other financial markets in the United States, which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or other equity securities. These disruptions in the financial markets may have other adverse effects on us or the economy generally, which could cause our stock price to decline. Our credit facilities include restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to respond to changing market conditions and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Our credit facilities impose restrictions on us that affect our distribution and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt. For example, we are subject to a maximum leverage ratio requirement (as defined) during the terms of the loans, which could reduce our ability to incur additional debt and consequently reduce our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Our credit facilities also contain limitations on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in excess of those required to maintain our REIT status. Specifically, our credit facilities limit distributions to 95% of funds from operations, but not less than the minimum necessary to enable us to meet our REIT income distribution requirements. In addition, our credit facilities contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to further mortgage our properties or reduce insurance coverage, and that require us to maintain specified levels of net worth. These or other limitations may adversely affect our flexibility and our ability to achieve our operating plans. We have and may continue to engage in hedging transactions, which can limit our gains and increase exposure to losses. We have and may continue to enter into hedging transactions to protect us from the effects of interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt. Our hedging transactions may include entering into interest rate swap agreements or interest rate cap or floor agreements, or other interest rate exchange contracts. Hedging activities may not have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. No hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. Moreover, interest rate hedging could fail to protect us or adversely affect us because, among other things:  Available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which we seek protection.  The duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability.  The party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay.  The credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction.  The value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value. Downward adjustments, or mark-to-market losses, would reduce our stockholders equity. Hedging involves risk and typically involves costs, including transaction costs, that may reduce our overall returns on our investments. These costs increase as the period covered by the hedging increases and during periods 18 Table of Contents of rising and volatile interest rates. These costs will also limit the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders. We generally intend to hedge as much of the interest rate risk as management determines is in our best interests given the cost of such hedging transactions. The REIT qualification rules may limit our ability to enter into hedging transactions by requiring us to limit our income from hedges. If we are unable to hedge effectively because of the REIT rules, we will face greater interest rate exposure than may be commercially prudent. As of December 31, 2007, we had five interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $785.0 million under which, at each monthly settlement date, we either (1) receive the difference between a fixed interest rate (the Strike Rate) and one-month LIBOR if the Strike Rate is less than LIBOR or (2) pay such difference if the Strike Rate is greater than LIBOR. In addition, in connection with entering into the acquisition and construction loan secured by our Center for Life Science | Boston property, we entered into four forward starting interest rate swap agreements, which are valued on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the net present value of the of the expected future cash flows on the swaps. At maturity of the forward starting interest rate swaps, we will either (a) receive payment from the counterparties if the accumulated balance is an asset, or (b) make payment to the counterparties if the accumulated balance is a liability with the resulting receipt or payment deferred and amortized as an increase or decrease to interest expense over the term of the forecasted borrowing. Other than these interest rate swaps, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. The fair value of our interest rate swaps was approximately ($21.8) million at December 31, 2007 and is included in other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. Interest we pay could reduce cash available for distributions. Additionally, if we incur variable rate debt, including borrowings under our $550 million secured construction loan, our $250 million secured term loan and our $600 million unsecured line of credit, to the extent not adequately hedged, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs. These increased interest costs would reduce our cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during a period of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments. If we fail to obtain external sources of capital, which is outside of our control, we may be unable to make distributions to our stockholders, maintain our REIT qualification, or fund growth. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. In addition, we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income, including any net capital gains. Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund future capital needs, including any necessary acquisition financing, from operating cash flow. Consequently, we rely on third-party sources to fund our capital needs. We may not be able to obtain financings on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on:  general market conditions,  the markets perception of our growth potential,  with respect to acquisition financing, the markets perception of the value of the properties to be acquired,  our current debt levels,  our current and expected future earnings,  our cash flow and cash distributions, and  the market price per share of our common stock or preferred stock. Our inability to obtain capital from third-party sources will adversely affect our business and limit our growth. Without sufficient capital, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our debt service obligations or make the cash distributions to our stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 19 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure Our charter and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares. Our charter and the articles supplementary with respect to our preferred stock contain 9.8% ownership limits that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction. Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person may own more than 9.8% of the value of our outstanding shares of capital stock or more than 9.8% in value or number (whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock or Series A preferred stock. The board may not grant such an exemption to any proposed transferee whose ownership of in excess of 9.8% of the value of our outstanding shares would result in the termination of our status as a REIT. These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify as a REIT. The ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. We could authorize and issue stock without stockholder approval that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock. In addition, our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. The board may also, without stockholder approval, amend our charter to increase the authorized number of shares of our common stock or our preferred stock that we may issue. The board of directors could establish a series of common stock or preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of such series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Certain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction. Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or the MGCL, may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control. In some cases, such an acquisition or change of control could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of their shares. These MGCL provisions include:  business combination provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder for certain periods. An interested stockholder is generally any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting stock. A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. The business combinations are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. After that period, the MGCL imposes special voting requirements on such combinations, and  control share provisions that provide that control shares of our company acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights unless holders of two-thirds of our voting stock (excluding interested shares) consent. Control shares are shares that, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors. A control share acquisition is the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares. In the case of the business combination provisions of the MGCL, we opted out by resolution of our board of directors with respect to any business combination between us and any person provided such business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of directors who are not affiliates or associates of such person). In the case of the control share provisions of the MGCL, we opted out pursuant to a provision in our bylaws. However, our board of directors may by resolution elect to opt in to the business combination provisions of 20 Table of Contents the MGCL. Further, we may opt in to the control share provisions of the MGCL in the future by amending our bylaws, which our board of directors can do without stockholder approval. The partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership, Maryland law, and our charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. Our board of directors may amend our investing and financing policies without stockholder approval, and, accordingly, our stockholders would have limited control over changes in our policies that could increase the risk we default under our debt obligations or that could harm our business, results of operations and share price. Our board of directors has adopted a policy of limiting our indebtedness to approximately 60% of our total market capitalization. Total market capitalization is defined as the sum of the market value of our outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt-to-total capitalization ratio), plus the aggregate value of operating partnership units we do not own, plus the liquidation preference of outstanding preferred stock, plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness. However, our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of debt that we may incur, nor do they limit the types of properties we may acquire or develop. Our board of directors may alter or eliminate our current policy on borrowing or investing at any time without stockholder approval. Changes in our strategy or in our investment or leverage policies could expose us to greater credit risk and interest rate risk and could also result in a more leveraged balance sheet. These factors could result in an increase in our debt service and could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make expected distributions to our stockholders. Higher leverage also increases the risk we would default on our debt. We may invest in properties with other entities, and our lack of sole decision-making authority or reliance on a co-venturers financial condition could make these joint venture investments risky. We have in the past and may continue in the future to co-invest with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities. We may acquire non-controlling interests or share responsibility for managing the affairs of a property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. In such events, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property or entity. Investments in entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved. These risks include the possibility that partners or co-venturers:  might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions,  may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and  may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers if:  we structure a joint venture or conduct business in a manner that is deemed to be a general partnership with a third party, in which case we could be liable for the acts of that third party,  third-party managers incur debt or other liabilities on behalf of a joint venture which the joint venture is unable to pay, and the joint venture agreement provides for capital calls, in which case we could be liable to make contributions as set forth in any such joint venture agreement, or  we agree to cross-default provisions or to cross-collateralize our properties with the properties in a joint venture, in which case we could face liability if there is a default relating to those properties in the joint venture or the obligations relating to those properties. 21 Table of Contents We have investments in limited liability companies with PREI, which were formed in the second quarter of 2007. While we, as managing member, are authorized to carry out the day-to-day management of the business and affairs of the PREI limited liability companies, PREIs prior written consent is required for certain decisions, including decisions relating to financing, budgeting and the sale or pledge of interests in the properties owned by the PREI limited liability companies. In addition, each of the PREI operating agreements includes a put/call option whereby either member can cause the limited liability company to sell certain properties in which it holds leasehold interests to us at any time after the fifth anniversary and before the seventh anniversary of the acquisition date. The put/call option may be exercised at a time we do not deem favorable for financial or other reasons, including the availability of cash at such time and the impact of tax consequences resulting from any sale. Risks Related to Our REIT Status Our failure to qualify as a REIT under the Code would result in significant adverse tax consequences to us and would adversely affect our business and the value of our stock. We believe that we have operated and intend to continue operating in a manner intended to allow us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through a partnership further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a seemingly minor technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Our REIT status depends upon various factual matters and circumstances that may not be entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must satisfy a number of requirements regarding the composition of our assets. Also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding capital gains. In addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, each of which could have retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT, or could reduce the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS that we qualify as a REIT, and the statements in this report are not binding on the IRS or any court. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will face serious adverse tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders because:  we would not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates,  we could also be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes, and  unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we were disqualified. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as ordinary corporate distributions. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock and our preferred stock. To maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions to make distributions to our stockholders. To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders certain amounts each year based on our income as described above. At times, we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy these distribution requirements and may need 22 Table of Contents to borrow funds to maintain our REIT status or to avoid the payment of income and excise taxes. These borrowing needs could result from:  differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes,  the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures,  the creation of reserves, or  required debt or amortization payments. We may need to borrow funds at times when the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for borrowing. These borrowings could increase our costs or reduce our equity and adversely affect the value of our common stock or preferred stock. To maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. We may be required to make distributions to stockholders at times when it would be more advantageous to reinvest cash in our business or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Stock The market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile. The market price of our common stock may be volatile. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:  actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends,  changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates,  publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry,  increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield,  changes in market valuations of similar companies,  adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur or acquisitions we make in the future,  additions or departures of key management personnel,  actions by institutional stockholders,  speculation in the press or investment community,  the realization of any of the other risk factors presented in this report, and  general market and economic conditions. An increase in market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Changes in market interest rates have historically affected the trading prices of equity securities issued by REITs. One of the factors that will influence the price of our common stock and preferred stock will be the dividend yield on such stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock or series A preferred stock to expect a higher dividend yield. Further, higher interest rates would 23 Table of Contents likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could harm our financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market price of our common stock and series A preferred stock to fall. Broad market fluctuations could negatively impact the market price of our common stock or preferred stock. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies in industries similar or related to ours and that have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. These broad market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock or preferred stock. Furthermore, our operating results and prospects may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors or may be lower than those of companies with comparable market capitalizations. Either of these factors could lead to a material decline in the market price of our common stock or preferred stock. Our distributions to stockholders may decline at any time. We may not continue our current level of distributions to stockholders. Our board of directors will determine future distributions based on a number of factors, including:  cash available for distribution,  operating results,  our financial condition, especially in relation to our anticipated future capital needs,  then current expansion plans,  the distribution requirements for REITs under the Code, and  other factors our board deems relevant. The number of shares of our common stock available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict whether future issuances of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares for resale in the open market will decrease the market price per share of our common stock. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding 65,571,304 shares of our common stock, as well as units in our operating partnership and long-term incentive plan (LTIP) units, which may be exchanged for 2,863,564 shares and 454,716 shares, respectively, of our common stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2007, we had reserved an additional 1,345,230 shares of common stock for future issuance under our incentive award plan. Furthermore, under the rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2005 regarding registration and offering procedures, if we meet the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under Rule 405 of the Securities Act, we are permitted to file an automatic shelf registration statement that will be immediately effective upon filing. On September 15, 2006, we filed such an automatic shelf registration statement, which may permit us, from time to time, to offer and sell debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants and other securities to the extent necessary or advisable to meet our liquidity needs. Any of the following could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock:  sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur,  the exchange of units for common stock,  the exercise of any options granted to certain directors, executive officers and other employees under our incentive award plan,  issuances of preferred stock with liquidation or distribution preferences, and  other issuances of our common stock. 24 Table of Contents Additionally, the existence of units, options and shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of units may adversely affect the terms upon which we may be able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. In addition, future sales of shares of our common stock may be dilutive to existing stockholders. From time to time we also may issue shares of our common stock or operating partnership units in connection with property, portfolio or business acquisitions. We may grant additional demand or piggyback registration rights in connection with these issuances. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock or may adversely affect the terms upon which we may be able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities.
