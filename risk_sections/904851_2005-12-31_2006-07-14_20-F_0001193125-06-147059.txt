Risk FactorsNegative Economic, Political and Regulatory developments in Argentina Including Export Controls May Adversely Affect our Domestic Operations. Historically, YPFs results were rather seasonable as a result of greater natural gas sales during the winter. After the 2002 devaluation and as a consequence of the natural gas price freeze imposed by the Argentine government, the use of this fuel was diversified, thus generating an increase in its long-term demand throughout the year. Due to the sales of the interest in Global and in YPF Indonesia Ltd., YPF conducts its main activities in Argentina, where almost 100% of total consolidated sales were made during 2005, including oil and products exports. 60 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2004, YPF Holdings Inc. and YPF International S.A. sold their interests in Global Companies LLC and affiliates (Global), and in YPF Indonesia Ltd., respectively. Income from these sales was included in the Income from sale of discontinued operations account of the statements of income. As a consequence, Global and YPF Indonesia Ltd. results are disclosed in Income on discontinued operations account of the statements of income. Net sales and operating income of these operations amounted to Ps. 3,658 million and Ps. 29 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Assets and liabilities of these companies amounted to Ps. 493 million and Ps. 373 million as of December 31, 2003, and were disclosed net in the Other assets account of the balance sheet. Critical Accounting Policies Basis of presentation of financial statements Our accounting policies are described in Notes 1 and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with Argentine GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP. Argentine GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Functional Currency YPF has determined the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, because YPF transacts more of its operations in U.S. dollars or indexed to U.S. dollars than in any other currency. For U.S. GAAP reconciliation purposes, financial statements are remeasured into U.S. dollars and the assets and liabilities translated into Argentine pesos (reporting currency) at the exchange rate prevailing at year end and revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated at the exchange rate existing at the time of each transaction, or, if appropriate, at a weighted average of the exchange rates during the year. In determining the functional currency, we make judgments based on the collective economic indicators affecting YPF. The economic indicators we review include the currency in which cash flows are denominated, how sales prices are determined, the sales markets in which we operate, how our operating costs are derived, how financing is obtained and the level of intercompany transactions with Repsol YPF. A significant change in the facts and the circumstances relating to the collective economic indicators discussed above would result in our reassessing the functional currency. The determination of the functional currency to be applied to a business for accounting purposes is a decision which impacts, among other things, the reported results of operations, the exchange income or losses recorded and the translation differences arising from the conversion of its financial statements from the functional currency to the companys reporting currency. Oil and Gas Reserves YPF prepares its assumptions and estimates regarding oil and gas reserves taking into consideration the rules and regulations established for the oil and gas industry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the accounting principles laid down by the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board. In accordance with these rules, proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty that can be extracted from known fields in future years under existing economic and operating conditions, such as prices and costs as of the date of the estimates. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices only by contractual arrangements, but not of escalations based upon future conditions. In order to estimate its proved reserves, YPF prepares internal studies and uses, to a certain extent, reports of independent engineers. 61 Table of Contents Proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods and current economic conditions as of each balance sheet date. Additional oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery are included as proved developed reserves only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved. Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion, but does not include reserves attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation. Unproved reserves are those with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability and are classified as either probable or possible. YPF follows the successful effort method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and production operations. Accordingly, exploratory costs, excluding the costs of exploratory wells, have been charged to expense as incurred. Costs of drilling exploratory wells, including stratigraphic test wells, have been capitalized pending determination as to whether the wells have found proved reserves that justify commercial development. If such reserves were not found, the mentioned costs are charged to expense. Occasionally, however, an exploratory well may be determined to have found oil and gas reserves, but classification of those reserves as proved cannot be made when drilling is completed. In those cases, the cost of drilling the exploratory well shall continue to be capitalized if the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If any of the mentioned conditions is not met, cost of drilling exploratory wells is charged to expense. Intangible drilling costs applicable to productive wells and to developmental dry holes, as well as tangible equipment costs related to the development of oil and gas reserves, have been capitalized. The capitalized costs related to producing activities, including tangible and intangible costs, have been depreciated by field on the unit-of-production basis by applying the ratio of produced oil and gas to estimated recoverable proved and developed oil and gas reserves. The capitalized costs related to acquisitions of properties with proved reserves have been depreciated by field on the unit-of-production basis by applying the ratio of produced oil and gas to proved oil and gas reserves. Revisions of crude oil and natural gas proved reserves are considered prospectively in the calculation of depreciation. Revisions in estimates of reserves are performed at least once a year. Future costs related to hydrocarbon wells abandonment obligations are capitalized along with the related assets, and are depreciated using the unit-of-production method and a liability is recognized for this concept at the estimated value of the discounted payable amounts. Foreign unproved properties have been valued at cost translated as detailed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Capitalized costs related to unproved properties are reviewed periodically by Management to ensure that their carrying value does not exceed their estimated recoverable value. 62 Table of Contents Therefore, in performing an impairment test, YPFs management must make reasonable and supportable assumptions and estimates with respect to (i) the market value of reserves, (ii) oil fields production profiles, (iii) future investments and their amortization, taxes and costs of extraction and (iv) appropriate risk factors for unproved reserves and other factors. Such assumptions and estimates have a significant impact on evaluating the impairment of fixed assets (oil and gas investments). As such, any change in the variables used to prepare such assumptions and estimates may have, as a consequence, a significant effect in the impairment tests on investments in areas with oil reserves. The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines. On January 26, 2006, YPF announced that it would reduce its prior proved reserves estimates by 509 million barrels of oil equivalent. This amount represented 21% of YPFs total proved reserves originally reported as of December 31, 2004. Simultaneously, YPF announced that the Audit and Control Committee of its parent company, Repsol YPF, was undertaking an independent review of the facts and circumstances of the reduction in proved reserves with the assistance of an independent counsel, King & Spalding LLP. On January 27, 2006, the Audit Committee of YPF determined to rely on the investigation being conducted by Repsol YPFs Audit and Control Committee. The Audit and Control Committee presented the final conclusions and recommendations of the independent review to the Board of Directors of Repsol YPF at its meeting of June 15, 2006. On the same date, the Audit Committee of YPF evaluated such conclusions and recommendations, endorsed such conclusions and recommended to the Board of Directors of YPF that such recommendations be implemented by YPF. With respect to the accounting consequences of the review, we concluded as follows:  No significant adjustments to YPFs balance sheets or statements of income included in its statutory consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 have come to light.  No restatement of the YPFs balance sheets or statements of income included in its statutory consolidated financial statements for prior years is necessary. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyExploration and Production for an analysis of the reserves revision and Recent DevelopmentsReserves Revisions and Independent Review for a detailed discussion of the independent review and its conclusions. Impairment of long-lived assets YPF assesses the recoverability of its held-for-use assets on a business segment basis for Argentine GAAP purposes. With respect to operations that are held pending sale or disposal, YPFs policy is to record these assets at amounts that do not exceed net realizable value. Under U.S. GAAP, for oil and gas properties, YPF performs the impairment review on an individual field basis. Other long-live assets are aggregated, so that the individual cash flows produced by each group of assets may be separately analyzed. For Argentine and U.S. GAAP, held-for-use properties, grouped as described in previous paragraphs, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value. The impairment of oil and gas producing properties is calculated as the difference between the market value or, if appropriate, the discounted estimated future cash flows from its proved reserves and unproved reserves, adjusted for risks related to such reserves, in each field owned at the year end with the net book value of the assets relating thereto. Expected future cash flows from the sale or production of reserves are calculated considering crude oil prices based on a combination of market forward quotes and standard long term 63 Table of Contents projections. The discounted values of cash flows are determined using a reasonable and supportable discount rate based on standard WACC-CAPM (weighted average cost of capitalcapital asset pricing model) assumptions including, if appropriate, a risk premium related to this type of asset. The estimated cash flows are based on future levels of production, the future commodity prices, lifting and development costs, estimates of future expenditures necessary with respect to undeveloped oil and gas reserves, field decline rates, market demand and supply, economic regulatory climates and other factors. Charges for impairment are recognized in YPFs results from time to time as a result of, among other factors, adverse changes in the recoverable reserves from oil and natural gas fields, and changes in economic regulatory conditions. If proved reserves estimates were revised downward, net income could be negatively affected by higher impairment charge on the propertys book value. Therefore, YPFs management must make reasonable and supportable assumptions and estimates with respect to: (i) the market value of reserves, (ii) oil fields production profiles, (iii) future investments and their amortization, taxes and costs of extraction and (iv) risk factors for unproved reserves which are in accordance with the Swanson rule (which relates to the calculation of the mean value of a lognormal distribution knowing three points), these imply risk factors of 70% and 30% for probable and possible reserves, respectively and other factors. Such assumptions and estimates have a significant impact on calculations of depreciation in accordance with the unit of production method and evaluating the impairment of fixed assets (oil and gas investments). As such, any change in the variables used to prepare such assumptions and estimates may have, as a consequence, a significant effect on the impairment tests relating to investments in areas with oil and gas reserves. YPF performs asset valuation analyses on an ongoing basis as a part of its asset management program. In general, YPF does not view temporarily low oil prices as a triggering event for conducting the impairment tests. Accordingly, any impairment tests that YPF performs make use of YPFs long-term price assumptions for the crude oil and natural gas markets and petroleum products. Impact of Oil and Gas Reserves and Prices on Testing for Impairment Proved oil and gas properties held and used by YPF are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. YPF performs asset valuation analyses on an ongoing basis as a part of its asset management program. In general, YPF does not view temporarily low oil prices as a triggering event for conducting the impairment tests. Accordingly, any impairment tests that YPF performs make use of YPFs long-term price assumptions for the crude oil and natural gas markets and petroleum products. Depreciation Volumes produced and asset costs are known, while proved reserves have a high probability of recoverability and are based on estimates that are subject to some variability. The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is treated prospectively by depreciating the remaining book value of the assets over the future expected production, affecting next years net income. In 2005, 2004 and 2003 YPF recorded depreciation of fixed assets associated with hydrocarbon reserves amounting to Ps. 2,180 million, Ps. 1,936 million and Ps. 1,789 million, respectively. Asset retirement obligations Future costs related to hydrocarbon wells abandonment obligations are capitalized along with the related assets, and are depreciated using the unit-of-production method. As compensation, a liability is recognized for 64 Table of Contents this concept at the same estimated value of the discounted payable amounts. Future estimated retirement obligations and removal costs are based on managements best estimate of the time that the event will occur and the assertion of costs to be met with the removal of the asset. Asset removal technologies and costs, as well as political, environmental, safety and public expectations, are constantly changing. Consequently, the timing and future cost of dismantling are subject to significant modification. The timing and the amount of future dismantling expenditures are reviewed annually. As such, any change in variables used to prepare such assumptions and estimates can have, as a consequence, a significant effect in the liability and the related capitalized asset and in the future charges related to the retirement obligations. Environmental liabilities, litigation and other contingencies Environmental liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remediation are probable, material and can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates are based on either detailed feasibility studies of remediation approach and cost for individual sites or on YPFs estimate of costs to be incurred based on historical experience and available information based on the stage of assessment and/or remediation of each site. As additional information becomes available regarding each site or as environmental standards change, YPF revises its estimate of costs to be incurred in environmental assessment and/or remediation. Reserves are established to cover litigation and other contingencies which are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The final costs arising from litigation and other contingencies may vary from YPFs estimates on differing interpretations of laws, opinions and final assessments on the amount of claims. As such, changes in the facts or circumstances related to these types of contingencies, as well as the future outcome of these disputes, can have, as a consequence, a significant effect on the amount of reserves for litigation and other contingencies recorded. A reserve totalling Ps. 1,561 million, Ps. 1,298 million and Ps. 706 million as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, have been established to afford contingencies which are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of the management and its external counsel, the amount reserved reflects the best estimate, based on the information available as of the date of the issuance of these financial statements and of the possible outcome of the contingencies discussed above. Presentation of financial statements The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the effect of changes in the purchasing power of money by the application of the method for restatement in constant Argentine pesos set forth in Argentine GAAP until February 28, 2003, when the restatement in constant money was discontinued. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. U.S. GAAP Reconciliation The recurrent difference between YPFs net income under Argentine GAAP and its net income under U.S. GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is primarily due to the remeasurement into functional currency and translation into reporting currency, the elimination of the restatement into Argentine constant pesos, the effects of the sale of noncurrent assets to related parties, the impairment of long-lived assets, capitalization of financial expenses, accounting for assets retirement obligations and the timing for the recognition of insurance retrospective premiums. Under Argentine GAAP, financial statements are presented in constant Argentine pesos (reporting currency). Foreign currency transactions are recorded in Argentine pesos by applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange rate between the reporting and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction. Exchange rate differences arising on monetary items in foreign currency are recognized in the income statement of the period. 65 Table of Contents Under U.S. GAAP, a definition of the functional currency is required which may differ from the reporting currency. Management has determined, for YPF and certain of its subsidiaries and investees, the U.S. dollar to be its functional currency in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 52. Therefore, YPF has remeasured into U.S. dollars the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, prepared in accordance with Argentine GAAP by applying the procedures specified in SFAS No. 52. The objective of the remeasurement process is to produce the same results that would have been reported if the accounting records had been kept in the functional currency. Accordingly, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the balance sheet date (current) exchange rate. Amounts carried at prices in past transactions are remeasured at the exchange rates in effect when the transactions occurred. Revenues and expenses are remeasured on a monthly basis at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period, except for consumption of nonmonetary assets, which are remeasured at the rates of exchange in effect when the respective assets were acquired. Translation gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities arising from the remeasurement are included in the determination of net income (loss) in the period such gains and losses arise. For certain of YPFs subsidiaries and investees, YPF has determined the Argentine peso as its functional currency. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the financial statements of the mentioned subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are not included in determining net income and are reported in other comprehensive income, as a component of shareholders equity. The amounts obtained from the remeasurement process referred to above are translated into Argentine pesos under the provisions of SFAS No. 52. Assets and liabilities are translated at the current selling exchange rate of Argentine pesos Ps. 3.03, Ps. 2.98 and Ps. 2.93 to US$ 1, as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenues, expenses, gains and losses reported in the income statement are translated at the exchange rate existing at the time of each transaction or, if appropriate, at the weighted average of the exchange rates during the period. Translation effects of exchange rate changes are included as a cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. As of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the remeasurement into functional currency and the translation into reporting currency decreased net income determined according to Argentine GAAP by Ps. 1,479 million, Ps. 1,447 million and Ps. 1,629 million, respectively. YPF has proportionally consolidated, net of intercompany transactions, assets, liabilities, net revenues, cost and expenses of investees in which joint control is held, which is not allowed for U.S. GAAP purposes. The proportional consolidation generated an increase of Ps. 381 million, Ps. 672 million and Ps. 2,022 million in total assets and total liabilities as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and an increase of Ps. 1,216 million, Ps. 1,122 million and Ps. 760 million in net sales and Ps. 681 million, Ps. 640 million and Ps. 428 million in operating income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. From January 1, 2003, under Argentine GAAP, in order to perform the recoverability test, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets at business segment level. With respect to operations that were held pending sale or disposal, YPFs policy was to record these assets at amounts that did not exceed net realizable value. Under U.S. GAAP, for proved oil and gas properties, YPF performs the impairment review on an individual field basis. Other long-live assets are aggregated, so that the individual cash flows produced by each group of assets may be separately analyzed. Each asset is tested following the guidelines of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of LongLived Assets, by comparing the net book value of such an asset with the expected cash flow (before income tax and without discounting the cash flow). Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. When fair values are not available, YPF estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the assets. The accumulated adjustments under U.S. GAAP of the impairment provisions as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were Ps. 605 million, Ps. 764 million and Ps. 692 million, respectively, for YPFs Exploration and Production segment, and Ps. 6 million, Ps. 9 million and Ps. 12 million, respectively, for the Refining and Marketing segment, corresponding to investments in controlled companies. Impairment charges under U.S. GAAP amounted to Ps. 2 million, Ps. 177 million and Ps. 6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The impairment recorded in 2005 was mainly the result of 66 Table of Contents the downward revision in reserves made by YPF in December 2005. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyExploration and ProductionReserves. The impairments recorded in 2004 and 2003 were the result of studies conducted that have revealed a decrease in proved reserves. The adjusted basis after impairment results in lower depreciation under U.S. GAAP of Ps. 170 million, Ps. 122 million and Ps. 174 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under U.S. GAAP only interest expense on qualifying assets must be capitalized, regardless of the assets construction period. Under Argentine GAAP, for those assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use, borrowing costs (including interest and exchange differences) should be capitalized. SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Assets Retirement Obligations, requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement obligations liability is built up in cash flow layers, with each layer being discounted using the discount rate as of the date that the layer was created. Remeasurement of the entire obligation using current discount rates is not permitted. Each cash flow layer is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset. This additional carrying amount is then depreciated over the life of the asset. The liability is increased due to the passage of time based on the time value of money (accretion expense) until the obligation is settled. Argentine GAAP is similar to SFAS No. 143, except for a change in the discount rate is treated as a change in estimates, so the entire liability must be recalculated using the current discount rate, being the change added or reduced from the related asset. Under U.S. GAAP, results on sales of non current assets to related parties under common control and related accounts receivables are considered as a capital (dividend) transaction. Under Argentine GAAP, results on sales of non current assets and account receivables are recognized in the statement of income and the balance sheet, respectively. YPF, through its indirect subsidiary Greenstone Assurance Limited, is a member of Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). OIL is owned by and operated by and for its shareholders, all of whom are engaged in energy operations. Pursuant to OILs Rating and Premium Plan, there is a withdrawal premium (the Avoided Premium Surcharge or APS) to which insured members are liable under certain circumstances which include cancellation and non-renewal of the policy. The APS is calculated by OIL at its sole discretion, it is final and the amount shall not exceed the applicable future premiums that the insured would have paid absent such cancellation or non-renewal, in respect of losses incurred before the date on which the cancellation or non-renewal takes place. Such obligation, in substance, is similar to a retrospective premium to recover past losses which is paid, either through future premium payments (if the member remains in the company) or as a one-time payment if the member withdraws from OIL. The effect on net income under U.S. GAAP, as of December 31, 2004, was Ps. 123 million, which was recorded in the subsequent year for Argentine GAAP purposes. FIN No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R) clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The interpretations explain how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. These interpretations require existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. Under Argentine GAAP consolidation is based on the control of corporate decisions through shareholding (Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). FIN 46R is effective for YPF as of January 1, 2004. As of December 31, 2005, YPF has operations with one variable interest entity (VIE), which has been created in order to structure YPFs future deliveries of oil (FOS). Additionally, up to September 2005, YPF 67 Table of Contents had operations with a VIE related to another FOS transaction, which was cancelled in advance, as described in Note 10.c to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a further description refer to Transactions With Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities above. The effects before taxes of such consolidation as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 was (i) an increase in loans by Ps. 297 million and Ps. 1,198 million, respectively, (ii) an increase in current assets by Ps. 18 million and Ps. 192 million, respectively, (iii) the elimination of net advances from crude oil purchasers from balance sheets by Ps. 196 million and Ps. 898 million respectively, and (iv) a decrease in shareholders equity by Ps. 83 million and Ps. 108 million, respectively. The effects before taxes of the consolidation as of December 31, 2004 of these VIE following the provisions of FIN 46R were accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle. For a more detailed discussion of the most significant differences between Argentine GAAP and U.S. GAAP, please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Consolidated Oil and Gas Reserves and Production The following table sets forth YPFs estimated proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas on a consolidated basis at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The reserve estimates set forth below were prepared in accordance with Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. At December 31, As restated 2005 2004 2003 (millions of barrels) Estimated proved crude oil reserves (1)(2)(3) Developed 604 863 984 Undeveloped 173 201 218 Total 777 1,064 1,202 (billions of cubic feet) Estimated proved natural gas reserves (1)(2)(3) Developed 3,201 4,045 4,226 Undeveloped 1,482 1,631 2,223 Total 4,683 5,676 6,449 (millions of barrels) Crude oil production (1)(2) 134 146 157 (billions of cubic feet) Natural gas production (1)(2) 667 705 644 (1) Crude oil (including condensate and natural gas liquids) and gas reserves and production amounts are stated before making any deductions in respect of royalties.

(3) Restated at December 31, 2003 and 2004. In December 2005, YPF reduced by 509 million barrels of oil equivalent its oil and natural gas proved reserves in Argentina, including 493 million barrels of oil equivalent corresponding to proved developed and undeveloped reserves of YPF and 16 million barrels of oil equivalent corresponding to proved developed and undeveloped reserves of affiliated companies. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyExploration and ProductionReserves and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 68 Table of Contents Overview of Consolidated Results of Operations Macroeconomic conditions Though at a slower pace than in 2004, the world economy kept growing during 2005. The American economy is growing by 3.3% a year and it is expected that the worlds GDP growth will be 4.3%. In Asia, China is still leading the expansion. Consumption and international trade growth has caused commodity prices to increase, thus favoring exporting countries. In Latin America, high international prices of the regions main oil export products, have favored the economic performance of Latin American countries, showing an improvement in their fiscal and external accounts. Oil prices have increased, marked by geopolitical tensions affecting the main producer regions of the world. During 2005, the WTI barrel price was US$ 56 per barrel on average (showing a 37% increase compared with last 2004 average), reaching a maximum of almost US$ 70 per barrel by the end of August. In the last days of 2005, the WTI crude oil barrel was quoted at US$ 59 per barrel. Within the favorable international and regional context, the Argentine economy grew steadily since 2003, with an estimated annual GDP growth of approximately 9.2% for 2005. The industrial and building activity grew by 7.8% and 14.6%, respectively. Exports increased by 15.8% to US$ 40,029 million, mainly driven by an increase in industrial manufacturing products exports. Imports rose by 27.8% due to the growth in consumption and investment in the country, reduced the balance of trade surplus, which dropped from US$ 12,104 million in 2004 to US$ 11,321 million in 2005. The fast pace of growth, the governments decision of avoiding a nominal appreciation of the local currency and an expansive monetary policy of the Central Bank increased inflation. Prices increased by 12.3% in 2005, thus almost duplicating the 2004 inflation rate of 6.1%. Authorities decided to fight against inflation by agreeing to the prices of a basket of home consumption main products with the private sector. From January to May 2006 retail inflation was 4.4%, eight tenths below that of the period from January to May 2005. In December 2005, the Argentine Government resorted to the Central Bank reserves in order to cancel all financial obligations to the IMF. After payment of US$ 9,530 million the international reserves were reduced to US$18,580 million. The operation resulted in lower payments throughout 2006. As a result the Peso exchange rate increased to Ps 3.03, a 1.7% depreciation compared to December 2004. Unlike the other currencies of the region, which appreciated against the U.S. Dollar, the Argentine Peso was stable throughout the year. Together with economic growth, the unemployment rate kept falling as a consequence of informal and formal job increases. The data corresponding to the fourth quarter of 2005 showed that 12.1% of the active population is unemployed, which is 2 points lower than 14.1% in the prior year, whereas average real wages of the economy increased by 7.1% annually. National fiscal revenue increased by 21.3% in 2005, allowing for a national primary fiscal surplus of 3.7% of GDP. The first stage of restructuring the defaulted public debt was successfully completed by the middle of 2005, when 76% of the Argentine offer was accepted. Thus, Argentina significantly reduced its indebtedness level and its funding needs for the future, since the new securities are very favorable in regards to term and interest rate. Two issues are still pending: (i) the resolution of a smaller portion of the defaulted debt which was not included in the debt swap (the so called Paris Club) and (ii) government bondholders who have not accepted the Argentine proposal. The Argentine hydrocarbon industry is still facing distortions. Within a framework of increasing international prices, liquid fuel prices remained practically unchanged in the local market. Moving withholdings 69 Table of Contents of crude oil exports remained at a maximum of 45%. The lack of local diesel supply and low local prices required the implementation of a plan exempting customs duty payments on a larger scale, which will be repeated in 2006. The Argentine economy starts 2006 with favorable prospects regarding economic growth, but with a significant concern about inflation levels. Private analysts forecast that the GDP will grow more than 6.8% a year, within a context of high inflation, estimated on average to be 13%. YPF, however, cannot predict the evolution of future macroeconomic events. Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain financial information as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (percentage of net sales) Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales (49.2 ) (46.2 ) (44.3 ) Gross profit 50.8 53.8 55.7 Administrative expenses (2.4 ) (2.2 ) (2.1 ) Selling expenses (7.2 ) (7.0 ) (6.6 ) Exploration expenses (1.2 ) (1.9 ) (1.6 ) Operating income 40.0 42.7 45.4 As mentioned above in this Item 5, during the year ended December 31, 2004, YPF Holdings Inc. and YPF International S.A. sold their interests in Global and in YPF Indonesia Ltd., respectively. As a consequence, Global and YPF Indonesia Ltd. results for year ended 2004 and 2003 were disclosed in Income on discontinued operations account of the statement of income. Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were Ps. 22,901 million compared to Ps. 19,931 million in 2004, representing a 15% increase, resulting from higher international prices which affected the products sold in the export market, whereas in the domestic market, natural gas prices increased, due to the application of the price scheme set forth by the Secretariat of Energy (See Item 4. Information on the CompanyRegulatory Framework and Relationship with the Argentine GovernmentMarket Regulation), as did crude oil, diesel and jet fuel prices. This higher income due to better prices was partially offset by a fall in the volume sold, mainly of oil, due to lower crude oil production resulting from trade union strikes affecting the Province of Chubut during the last semester and from the natural decline in the production curve. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were Ps. 19,931 million compared to Ps. 17,514 million in 2003, an increase of 14%. This increase mainly reflects stronger international oil and refined products prices, partially offset by higher withholdings of hydrocarbon exports and higher discounts due to inferior oil quality, an increase in international costs of freight, a decrease of crude oil volume sold, due to lower production, as well as an increase in domestic prices of diesel, propylene and natural gas. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 was Ps. 11,258 million, compared to Ps. 9,212 million in 2004, representing a 22% increase, mainly due increased oil purchases to offset the lower production and diesel fuel and natural gas imports, and an increase in royalties because of the increase in the price per barrell of WTI, depreciation and other production costs. 70 Table of Contents The cost of sales in 2004 was Ps. 9,212 million, compared to Ps. 7,756 million in 2003, an increase of 19% mainly due to higher purchases of crude oil and natural gas, and higher royalties, depreciation and other production cost. Operating Income Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was Ps. 9,161 million compared with Ps. 8,471 million in 2004, which represents an 8% increase resulting from higher international prices that increased refined product export sale margins. Operating income in 2004 was Ps. 8,471 million compared to Ps. 7,955 million in 2003, which represents an increase of 6%. This increase was mainly due to higher international prices that increase refined products export sale margins. Other Expenses, net Other expenses, net decreased to Ps. 570 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to a Ps. 1,012 million loss in 2004, resulting from a decrease in provisions for lawsuits, environmental remediation and other contingencies. Other expenses net increased to Ps. 1,012 million in 2004 from Ps. 152 million in 2003, mainly reflecting an increase in provisions related to pending lawsuits, environmental issues and other contingencies. The most significant contingencies are described in Item 8. Legal Proceedings. Financial income (expense), net and holding gains In 2005 financial income, net was Ps. 102 million compared to financial income, net of Ps. 138 million in 2004, resulting from higher financial losses of Ps. 36 million, mainly from the early repayments of the debt in Mega and the FOS III transaction (See Transaction with Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities below), partially offset by holding profits on inventories. In addition, the peso devaluation generated a translation difference net profit of Ps. 96 million compared to Ps. 10 million net loss in 2004. In 2004 financial income net was Ps. 138 million compared to financial expense net of Ps. 50 million in 2003. The increase in financial income reflects an increase in holding gains on inventories due to higher production cost. Taxes Income tax expense during 2005 was Ps. 3,410 million compared to Ps. 3,017 million in 2004. The effective income tax rate for 2005 and 2004 was 38.98% and 38.22%, respectively, compared to the statutory income tax rate of 35%. Income tax expense during 2004 was Ps. 3,017 million compared to Ps. 3,290 million in 2003. The effective income tax rate for 2004 and 2003 was 38.22% and 41.55%, respectively, compared to the statutory income tax rate of 35%. The significant increase in the effective tax rate above the statutory rate is primarily due to the non-recognition for tax purposes of higher depreciation expenses that resulted from the restatement in constant Argentine pesos of fixed assets and inventories. Net Income Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was Ps. 5,337 million compared to Ps. 4,876 in 2004, an increase of 9.45%. This increase mainly reflects the increase in operating results of Ps. 690 million, a decrease in 71 Table of Contents other expenses, net, of Ps. 442 million, and lower income on long term investments of Ps. 115 million. This increase was partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of Ps. 393 million and a decrease in income from the sale of discontinued operations of Ps. 139 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was Ps. 4,876 million compared to Ps. 4,628 million in 2003, an increase of 5%. This increase mainly reflects the increase of 6% in operating income and lower financial expenses, partially offset by the increase in other expenses net, as well as income from the sale of discontinued operations of Ps. 139 million. Results of Operations by Business Segment The tables below set forth YPFs net sales and revenues and operating income by business segment for 2005, 2004 and 2003 as well as the percentage changes in revenues for the periods shown. 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 (millions of pesos) Net sales and revenues Exploration and Production (1) 15,195 14,141 12,399 7.45 % 14.05 % Refining and Marketing 18,178 15,808 14,667 14.99 % 7.78 % Chemical 2,269 2,146 1,553 5.73 % 38.18 % Corporate and others 330 266 236 24.06 % 12.71 % Consolidation adjustments (13,071 ) (12,430 ) (11,341 ) Total 22,901 19,931 17,514 14.90 % 13.80 % 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 (millions of pesos) Operating income Exploration and Production (1) 7,140 7,140 6,362 0.00 % 12.23 % Refining and Marketing 1,900 1,324 1,527 43.50 % (13.29 )% Chemical 542 564 387 (3.90 )% 45.74 % Corporate and others (451 ) (430 ) (311 ) 4.88 % 38.26 % Consolidation adjustments 30 (127 ) (10 ) Total 9,161 8,471 7,955 8.15 % 6.49 % (1) From January 1, 2005, Natural Gas and Electricity segment operations are included in the Exploration and Production business segment. The information presented for comparative purposes was restated to give retroactive effect to this change. The net sales of these operations in 2004 and 2003 were Ps. 577 million and Ps. 418 million, respectively, and the operating income was Ps. 262 million and Ps. 180 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively Transactions with Controlled Companies In the ordinary course of YPFs business, YPF maintains purchases, sales and financing transactions with related parties as mentioned in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Exploration and Production From January 1, 2005, the Natural Gas and Electricity segment operations are included in the Exploration and Production business segment. The information presented for comparative purposes was restated to give retroactive effect to this change. 72 Table of Contents Exploration and Production net sales in 2005 were Ps. 15,195 million compared to Ps. 14,141 million in 2004, an increase of 7%. Net crude oil sales increased by Ps. 1,515 million mainly due to higher international oil prices used to determine internal transfer prices between business segments, partially offset by a reduction in sales volumes, due to lower crude oil production resulting from trade union strikes affecting the Province of Chubut during the last semester and from a natural decline in the production curve, which was partially offset by purchases from external parties. Additionally, during 2005, natural gas sales increased by Ps. 488 million due to higher industrial prices and natural gas liquids sales increased by Ps. 122 million. Due to higher operating expenses, mainly royalties, depreciations, preservation, repair and maintenance expenses and crude oil purchases, so as to honor prior sales commitments, Exploration and Production operating income in 2005 remained almost the same as in 2004. Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production during 2005 decreased to 367 thousand barrels per day, compared to 399 thousand barrels per day in 2004. Natural gas production in 2005 decreased to 1,827 million cubic feet per day from 1,926 million cubic feet per day in 2004, as a consequence of a production decrease due to the natural decline in the production curve. Exploration and Production net sales during 2004 were Ps. 14,141 million compared to Ps. 12,399 million in 2003, an increase of 14%. Net crude oil sales increased by Ps. 1,099 million mainly as a consequence of higher international oil prices used to determine internal transfer prices, partially offset by a reduction in sales volumes, due to a lower crude oil production. Additionally, during 2004 there was an increase of Ps. 480 million in natural gas sales due to higher industrial prices and an increase in production, as well as a natural gas liquids sales increase of Ps. 79 million. Due to higher operating expenses, primarily royalties, depreciation, preservation, repair and maintenance and crude oil purchases, partially offset by better margins obtained by Mega (due to higher ethane, LPG and natural gasoline prices), Exploration and Production operating income increased by 12%, to Ps. 7,140 million in 2004 compared to Ps. 6,362 million in 2003. Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production during 2004 decreased to 399 thousand barrels per day compared to 430 thousand barrels per day obtained in 2003. Natural gas production during 2004 increased to 1,926 million of cubic feet per day from 1,767 million of cubic feet per day in 2003. Refining and Marketing Net sales in 2005 were Ps. 18,178 million, a 15% increase compared to Ps. 15,808 million in 2004, mainly as a result of higher exports prices of diesel fuel, fuel oil and fuel, partially offset by lower export volumes of diesel fuel and an increase in exports withholdings. In the domestic market, diesel, jet fuel and lubricants bases prices and sales volume increased. Operating income in 2005 was Ps. 1,900 million, a 44% increase compared to Ps. 1,324 million in 2004. This increase resulted from increased net sales due to higher prices, partially offset by greater purchases of imported diesel fuel, an increase of crude oil prices, greater refining expenses and greater transportation expenses. Refining cost per barrell in 2005 was 7.6, compared to Ps. 7.2 in 2004, a 6% increase. Refinery throughput in 2005, including 50% of Refinor, reached 319.9 thousand barrels per day, representing a utilization rate of 92.6% of the existing processing capacity of 345.6 thousand barrels per day. Net sales in 2004 were Ps. 15,808 million, an 8% increase compared to Ps. 14,667 million in 2003, mainly as a result of higher exports prices of refined products, partially offset by lower sales volumes of gasoline and diesel in the international market, and an increase in exports withholdings. Sales volumes of diesel in the local market were higher than 2003 in order to supply local demand, while prices remained significantly lower than export prices. 73 Table of Contents Operating income in 2004 was Ps. 1,324 million, a 13% decrease compared to Ps. 1,527 million in 2003, mainly reflecting a higher cost of crude oil purchased to the Exploration and Production segment and higher refining cost. Refining cost per barrel in 2004 was Ps. 7.2, compared to Ps. 6.3 in 2003, a 14% increase. Refinery throughput in 2004 reached 298 thousand barrels per day, representing a utilization rate of 93%. Processing capacity was 319.5 thousand barrels per day. Chemical Net sales in 2005 were Ps. 2,269 million compared to Ps. 2,146 million in 2004, resulting mainly from an increase in export sales due to better international prices. Operating income in 2005 was Ps. 542 million compared to Ps. 564 million in 2004. This decrease resulted from increased purchases and depreciation, partially offset by higher sales volumes and higher prices in the domestic and export market. In addition, Profertils operating income increased, but was partially offset by the sale of Petroken in 2004 which therefore generated no income for YPF in 2005. Net sales during 2004 were Ps. 2,146 million compared to Ps. 1,553 million in 2003. This increase mainly reflects a strong increase in sales volumes, primary exported, due to the methanol production record reached, which was 12% higher than in 2003. Operating income in 2004 was Ps. 564 million, an increase of 46%, compared to Ps. 387 million in 2003. This increase reflects higher sales volumes and higher Profertil operating income, which achieved a substantial improvement in operations. The increase in the production was accompanied by an increase in ureas international prices, which reached its highest level since 1995. Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Condition Total net debt outstanding as of December 31, 2005 was US$ 479 million (Ps. 1,453 million), consisting of short-term debt (including the current portion of long-term debt) of US$ 114 million (Ps. 346 million) and long-term debt of US$ 365 million (Ps. 1,107 million). As of December 31, 2005, almost all of our debt was denominated in U.S. Dollars. The use of derivatives is detailed in Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Since September 2001, YPF has repurchased certain of its publicly-traded bonds in open market transactions on an arms-length basis. YPF has repurchased approximately US$ 285 million of its outstanding bonds, which have not been cancelled and remain in its investment portfolio. YPF may from time make additional purchases of, or effect other transactions relating to, its publicly-traded bonds if in YPFs own judgment the market conditions are attractive. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was Ps. 8,251 million in 2005, compared to Ps. 8,515 million in 2004, a decrease of 3%. Higher operating income in 2005 was partially decreased by lower credits received from the parent company in 2005 compared to 2004. The principal uses of cash in investing and financing activities in 2005 included Ps. 3,722 million in fixed asset acquisitions, Ps. 4,878 million in dividend payments and Ps. 483 million in net repayments of outstanding loans. The principal cash provided by these activities included the sale of Petroken and PBB, which generated Ps. 454 million. In 2004, the principal uses of cash from investing and financing activities included Ps. 2,867 million in fixed assets acquisitions, Ps. 5,310 million in dividends payments and Ps. 980 million in net repayments of outstanding loans. In 2004 the principal cash provided by these activities included Ps. 244 million from the sale of discontinued operations. 74 Table of Contents Our current financing policy is to use cash flows provided by operating activities to fund both investing and operating activities, as well as to settle outstanding financial liabilities. YPFs working capital is sufficient for the companys present requirements. The Shareholders Meeting held on April 19, 2005, approved a Notes Program of up to US$ 700 million. The proceeds of this program will be used to refinance liabilities, and to invest in working capital and fixed assets in Argentina and in related companies. Notes could be issued with or without guarantee. The Board of Directors will determine the terms, conditions and characteristics of each issuance, if this source of financing is required. The following table sets forth information with regard to our commitments for the periods indicated below with regard to our debt: Expected Maturity Date 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (millions of Ps.)

(2) Includes purchase commitments under commercial agreements that do not provide for a total fixed amount, which have been valued using YPFs best estimates. (3) Reserves for contingent liabilities, which amount to US$ 408 million, are not included in the contractual obligations table above, as YPF based on the evidence available to date cannot reasonably estimate the settlement date such contingencies may become due. (4) The Company has signed contracts under which it has committed to buy certain products and services, and to sell natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and other products. Some of the contracts include penalty clauses that stipulate compensation for a breach of the obligation to receive or to deliver the products under contract. Furthermore, the Company is subject to certain regulations requiring the Company to supply the domestic hydrocarbon market demand. 75 Table of Contents Total Less than1 year 1  3 years 3  5 years More than5 years (million US$) Sale Commitments Crude oil sales 77 32 45   Natural Gas sales 9,162 1,109 1,681 1,533 4,839 LPG sales 3,374 849 1,531 284 710 Other petroleum and petrochemical product sales 3,543 769 994 518 1,262 Services 204 23 43 38 100 Total 16,360 2,782 4,294 2,373 6,911 YPF has additional commitments under derivatives contracts and guarantees. For a discussion of these additional commitments see Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Guarantees Provided below. Transactions With Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities Since 1996, YPF has entered into three forward oil sale agreements, which we refer to as the FOS transactions in this annual report. These agreements were entered into in order to obtain cash to fund operations in advance of the actual sale and delivery of oil. Under these transactions, YPF was advanced US$ 381 million in 1996, US$ 300 million in 1998 and US$ 383 million in 2001, against future deliveries of oil. YPFs obligations under the FOS transactions are recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet as customer advances and will be reduced and moved to income as the physical deliveries are made over the term of the contracts. As of December 31, 2005, the amount of FOS customer advances recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was Ps. 196 million (US$ 64 million). The obligations to deliver crude oil under the agreements entered into in 1996 have been satisfied in their entirety, with the last delivery having taken place in October 2003. The obligations to deliver crude oil under the agreement entered into in 2001 were cancelled on September 30, 2005. The obligations to deliver crude oil under the 1998 agreement will continue through May 2008. The structure of the remaining FOS transaction is similar to the ones already cancelled. YPF enters into a forward oil sale agreement that calls for the future delivery of oil for the life of the contract. YPF is paid in advance for the future delivery of oil. The price of the oil to be delivered is calculated using various factors, including the expected future price and quality of the crude oil being delivered. The counterparty or assignee to the oil supply agreement is a special purpose entity incorporated in the Cayman Islands, which finances itself as described below. The oil to be delivered under the supply agreement is subsequently sold in the open market. YPF is exposed to any change in the price of the crude oil it will deliver in the future under the FOS transaction. YPFs exposure derives from the crude oil swap agreement under which YPF pays a fixed price with respect to the nominal amount of the crude oil sold, and receives the variable market price of such crude oil. See Item 11.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market RiskCommodity Price RiskCrude Oil Price Swaps and Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions. See Note 13.k) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the treatment of the FOS transactions under U.S. GAAP. The following provides an overview of the outstanding FOS transaction: FOS II Date June 24, 1998 Net proceeds (1) US$ 299,967,289 SPE Oil Enterprises Ltd. SPE Debt US$315 million 6.239% notes Purchaser Morgan Guaranty Trust Marketer YPF Guarantee/hedge Oil Price Hedge Agreement/ Default Insurance Total crude oil barrels to be delivered over the life of the contract 23,933,982 Average crude oil barrels per month 201,126 Term of transaction 10 years 76 Table of Contents (1) The total sale amount under the remaining FOS transaction is US$ 314,995,137. The difference between the net proceeds and the sale amount is deposited in a reserve account to cover certain contingencies and, absent an event of default or other events set forth in the transaction documents, will be paid to YPF during the last three months of the transaction term. The series of FOS II are insured by MBIA. Repsol YPF S.A. agreed to reimburse this third party insurer for any payment made by it as insurer in connection with the FOS II default insurance policy. YPFs monthly crude oil delivery obligation under the remaining FOS transaction represents approximately 2.14% of its monthly production as of December 31, 2005. Total remaining crude delivery obligations under the FOS transaction represents 5.13% of YPFs 2005 crude oil production. If YPF is not able to deliver the required number of barrels from its own production, YPF may purchase oil of similar quality in the open market. As described in Item 8. Legal proceedings on March 8, 2004, the Argentine tax authorities formally communicated to YPF their view that the FOS transaction should have been treated as financial transactions carried out in Argentina and, as such, should have been subject to the relevant tax withholdings. YPF has presented its defence rejecting the claim and arguing its position. Covenants in YPF indebtedness Our financial debt generally contains customary covenants for contracts of this nature, including negative pledge, material adverse change and cross-default clauses. In the event of a default under any series of our bonds, the trustee, at its sole discretion or at the request of the holders of at least one fifth or one quarter of the bonds, depending upon the series, can declare the bonds of that series to be due and payable. With respect to the financial debt containing covenants, totalling as of December 2005 US$ 390 million, YPF has agreed to clauses including, among others, to pay all amounts due on maturity and, subject to certain exceptions, not to establish liens or charges on its assets. In the event of a default, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the total principal of the outstanding debentures may declare due and immediately payable the principal and accrued interest on the debentures. Almost all of our total outstanding debt is subject to cross-default provisions. These provisions may be triggered if an event of default occurs with respect to the payment of principal or interest on debts equal to or exceeding US $ 20 million. As a result of these cross-default provisions, a default on the part of YPF or any of our consolidated subsidiaries covered by such provisions could result in a substantial portion of our debt being declared in default or accelerated. YPF believes that none of its debt or that of any of its consolidated subsidiaries is currently in default. Credit Rating On April 24, 2006, FITCH upgraded YPFs long-term debt rating to BB+. YPFs long-term debt rating was upgraded to Ba2 by Moodys on November 21, 2005. Standard & Poors maintains its rating at BB with a stable outlook. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. We do not have any ratings downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt or trigger any other contractual obligation on our part. However, a downgrade in our credit rating could have a material adverse effect on the cost of renewing existing credit facilities, or obtaining access to new ones in the 77 Table of Contents future. In the past, our main sources of liquidity have been our cash flows from operations, bank financings, issuances of debt securities and the proceeds from our divestment plan. Any future downgrades will not preclude us from using any of our existing credit lines. Guarantees Provided As of December 31, 2005, YPF had provided the following guarantees: YPF has signed guarantees in relation to the financing activities of Pluspetrol Energy S.A.and Central Dock Sud S.A. for US$ 43 million and US$ 91 million, respectively. YPF may from time to time make additional purchases of, or effect other transactions relating to, its publicly-traded bonds if in YPFs own judgment the market conditions are attractive. Capital Investments and Expenditures Capital investments in 2005 totalled approximately Ps.3,932 million. The table below sets forth YPFs capital expenditures and investments by activity for each of the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003. (in millions of Pesos) 2005 2004 2003 % % % Capital Expenditures and Investments Exploration and Production 3,179 81 2,480 81 2,342 90 Refining and Marketing 541 14 434 14 180 7 Chemical 104 2 86 3 47 2 Corporate and other 108 3 52 2 39 1 Total 3,932 100 % 3,052 100 % 2,608 100 % Future capital expenditures and investments YPF has projected investments for 2006 to be approximately US$ 1,688 million. Figures are disclosed in U.S. dollars as they are mainly budgeted and incurred in this currency. The breakdown by business segments is as follows: 2006 (millions of US$) Future Capital Investments and Expenditures Exploration and Production 1,232 Refining and Marketing 331 Chemical 65 Corporate and other 60 1,688 For a detailed description of the main investment projects see Item 4Information on the CompanyBusiness Overview. YPF expects to finance its 2006 capital expenditure budget mainly through cash from operations. Actual capital investments and expenditures may differ from these estimates. 78 Table of Contents Research and Development Research and development activities are managed by Repsol YPF. Management of Repsol YPF understands that selective investment in technology is the key to maintaining and improving its competitiveness in the markets in which it operates. Key to strategy implementation is the existence of a Technology Unit with operating centres located in Móstoles (Madrid, Spain) and in Ensenada (near Buenos Aires, Argentina), with a total staff of 400, as of December 31, 2005. The Technology Unit acts as a corporate center as well as providing services to the business lines of Repsol YPF and its subsidiaries. The Technology Unit seeks to pursue the development of proprietary processes and products that can offer a sustained competitive advantage, as well as shorter term technology support for incremental improvement of existing processes and products, and exploratory work and surveillance of emerging technologies that can change the business landscape in the future. About 15% of Repsol YPFs research and development effort takes place through partnerships with universities, research institutes and other companies with the goal of optimizing know-how acquisition, costs and workload. In 2005, Repsol YPFs research and development expenses totalled US$ 78 million, compared to US$ 71 million in 2004. In the Upstream business, the research focuses on improving recovery of mature oil fields, extra-heavy crude oil recovery and upgrade, monetizing gas reserves by NGL and GTL, environmental protection and remediation, including climate change mitigation, and technology applications for quick-win operating cost reductions. In the Downstream business, the research includes, among others: (i) technology support to oil refineries to adapt to increasingly stringent motor fuel quality specifications and to improve heavy crude oil conversion capability; (ii) differentiation of products available to the market, such as high-quality gas-oils and gasolines, bio fuels and high-technology gasoline and lubricants for sport competition; (iii) development of proprietary petrochemical technologies, such as those to produce propylene oxide and its derivatives, hydrogenated rubber, or agricultural plastics; and (iv) search for new niche applications of LPG products. Recent Developments Reserves Revisions and Independent Review On January 26, 2006, YPF announced that it would reduce its prior reserve estimates by 509 million barrels of oil equivalent including 493 million barrels of oil equivalent corresponding to proved developed and undeveloped reserves of YPF and 16 million barrels of oil equivalent corresponding to proved developed and undeveloped reserves of affiliated companies. This amount represented 21% of YPFs total proved reserves as of December 31, 2004. Simultaneously, YPF announced that the Audit and Control Committee of its parent company, Repsol YPF, was undertaking an independent review of the facts and circumstances of the reduction in proved reserves with the assistance of an independent counsel, King & Spalding LLP. On January 27, 2006, the Audit Committee of YPF determined to rely on the investigation being conducted by Repsol YPFs Audit and Control Committee. The Audit and Control Committee of Repsol YPF presented the final conclusions and recommendations of the independent review to the Board of Directors of Repsol YPF at its meeting of June 15, 2006. On the same date, the Audit Committee of YPF evaluated such conclusions and recommendations, endorsed such conclusions and recommended to the Board of Directors of YPF that such recommendations be implemented by YPF. According to the independent review, the process for determining reserves with respect to YPFs fields in Argentina was flawed from 1999 to 2004 and YPF personnel at times failed to apply properly U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) criteria for reporting proved reserves. The independent review reported that this was principally due to:  Lack of proper understanding of and training on the requirements of the SEC for booking proved reserves.  Undue optimism regarding the technical performance of the fields and focus on replacement ratio. 79 Table of Contents  Absence of a meaningful deliberative process for determining proved reserves, and resolving disputes.  Unwillingness to accept personal responsibility for reporting internally adverse facts regarding reserves and a corresponding tendency to view such issues as falling within another persons or departments jurisdiction. Over time problems emerged and grew in the absence of delineation of responsibilities for booking proved reserves and in the absence of clear directives pre-2005. This notwithstanding, no evidence was found that any personnel involved in the reporting of proved reserves were motivated by a desire to further their personal gain. In addition, it was noted that the promulgation and implementation of a Reserves Reporting Manual (RRM) as well as other measures implemented by new senior management since 2005 redress these issues. With respect to the conduct of the current members of YPFs Board of Directors and executive committee, the independent review affirmed that there is no basis to believe that any of them participated in or had knowledge of the existence of any defects with respect to the reserves process. It was also noted that the changes made in 2005 greatly improved the reserves process, including by separating the reserves function from the business units, instituting the RRM, engaging in extensive training efforts, and expanding the Boards role in the reserves reporting function. These changes were found to redress the previous systemic flaws. In addition to emphasizing the importance of the numerous and effective organizational changes that YPF has undertaken in 2005, which have remedied in large measure the weaknesses identified above, as well as the significant steps already undertaken regarding public awareness about YPFs reserves, the independent review has also led to certain recommendations with the goal of continuing the process already underway. The Board of Directors has fully accepted the conclusions of the Audit and Control Committee of Repsol YPF and of its independent advisors and management is in the process of implementing these recommendations. See Notes 16 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 4. Information on the CompanyExploration and Production for an analysis of the reserves revision. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements YPF has entered into certain off-balance sheet arrangements, as described in Transactions With Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities, Guarantees Provided and Contractual Obligations above. 80 Table of Contents ITEM 6.

The Audit Committee National Executive Decree No. 677 (Regulations for the Transparency of Public Offerings), dated May 22, 2001, and Resolutions No. 400/02 and No. 402/02 of the National Securities Commission approved regulations regarding the Audit Committee. This regulation also requires that the by-laws or the regulations of the Board of Directors set forth the composition and regulations for the operation of the audit committee. The majority of members of the Audit Committee must be independent directors. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of YPF was created on May 6, 2004 and approved the Regulations that govern the Audit Committee. It is composed of three directors and three alternate members, each elected to a one-year term. The members of the Audit Committee are: President: Miguel Madanes, Members: Carlos de la Vega and Federico Mañero, and Alternative Members: Jorge Horacio Brito, Eduardo Elsztain and Carlos Bruno. Miguel Madanes met the conditions to be considered an Audit Committee Financial Expert pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Executive directors may not sit on the Audit Committee. See Section 16A Audit Committee Financial Expert for certain additional information. YPFs Audit Committee carries out, among others, the following activities:  Periodic inspection of the preparation of the financial and economic information of YPF.  Reviews and opines with respect to the Board of Directors proposals regarding the designation of the external auditors and the renewal, termination and conditions of their appointment, evaluates internal and external audit work, monitors YPFs relationship with the external auditors, and assures their independence.  Is informed about any services to be provided by the external auditors.  Provides appropriate disclosure, regarding operations in which there exists a conflict of interest with members of the corporate committees or controlling shareholders.  Opines on the reasonability of the proposals by the Board of Directors for fees and stock option plans of the directors and administrators of YPF.  Verifies compliance with applicable national or international regulations in matters related to behavior in the stock markets.  Ensures that the internal Codes of Ethics and Conduct and the stock markets codes, which are applicable to YPF and its subsidiaries, comply with normative demands and are adequate for YPF. Activities of the Audit Committee The Audit Committee, which, pursuant to its Regulations, meets as many times as needed, held ten meetings from April 2005 to March 2006. Performing its basic function of supporting the Board of Directors in its oversight duties, the Committee undertook a periodic review of economic and financial information of YPF, supervised the internal financial control systems and oversaw the independence of the external auditors. 86 Table of Contents Economic and financial information With the help of the CFO and considering work performed by the external and internal auditors, the Audit Committee analyzed the consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements before they were submitted to the Board of Directors. In addition, because YPF s shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, pursuant to the laws of the United States, it must submit YPFs annual financial information to the SEC in an Annual Report on Form 20-F. The Committee reviews such report before it is submitted to the SEC. Oversight of the internal control system In order to supervise the internal financial control systems and ensure that they are sufficient, appropriate and operate efficiently, the Committee oversaw the progress of the annual internal audit, which is aimed at identifying the Groups critical risks. Throughout the year, the Committee was informed by the Internal Audit department of the most relevant facts and recommendations arising out of its work performed during the year, and the status of the recommendations issued in prior years. YPF is implementing a Plan to Align the Internal Control System for Financial Reporting with the requirements established by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. This Section requires that, along with the annual audit, a report must be presented from YPFs management relating to the design, maintenance and periodic evaluation of the Internal Control System for Financial Reporting, accompanied by a report from YPFs external auditor. Several departments of the organization are involved in this activity, including the Internal Audit Direction. The Audit Committee has been informed of the projects progress by the Management of YPF at meetings held during the year. On March 2, 2005, the SEC granted foreign issuers a one-year extension on the schedule initially set for complying with the requirements outlined in Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Due to the new term, the certifications on the existence and effectiveness of the Internal Control System for Financial Reporting from the CEO and CFO of YPF will have to be issued for the annual audit for the 2006 fiscal year. Relations with the external auditors During the year, the Committee maintained a close relationship with the external auditors, which allowed it to make a detailed analysis of the relevant aspects of the audit of the financial statements and obtain detailed information on the planning and progress of the work. The Audit Committee has evaluated the services provided by the external auditors to YPF for the last Annual Report, which satisfy the condition of independence of the external auditors, as stated by the law, and its performance was satisfactory. Likewise, and as a consequence of this evaluation, the Committee states that it has no objections in the case that the General Shareholders meeting decides to re-elect Deloitte & Co. S.R.L. as external auditors, authorizing them to audit the financial statements ending December 31, 2006. Disclosure Committee In February 2003, YPF created a Disclosure Committee to carry out, among others, the following activities:  To monitor the overall compliance with regulations and principles of conduct of voluntary application, especially in relation to listed companies and their corporate governance. 87 Table of Contents  To direct and coordinate the establishment and maintenance of:  Procedures for the preparation of accounting and financial information to be approved and filed by YPF or which is generally released to the markets; and  Internal control systems that are adequate and efficient to ensure that YPFs financial statements included in annual and quarterly reports, as well as any accounting and financial information to be approved and filed by YPF, are accurate, reliable and clear.  Identify risks to YPFs businesses and activities that are significant and that may affect the accounting and financial information to be approved and filed.  To assume the activities that the laws of the United States and the SEC regulations applicable to YPF may attribute to a Disclosure Committee or Internal Committee of a similar nature, and especially those relating to the SEC regulations dated August 29, 2002 (Certification of Disclosure in Companies Quarterly and Annual ReportsSEC Release number 33-8124), in relation to the support for the certifications by YPFs CEO and CFO as to the existence and maintenance by YPF of adequate procedures and controls for the generation of the information to be included in the annual report on Form 20-F, and other information of a financial nature.  To take on activities similar to those stipulated in the SEC regulations for a Disclosure Committee with respect to the existence and maintenance by YPF of adequate procedures and controls for the preparation and content of the information to be included in the annual financial statements, and any accounting or financial information to be filed with the Argentine stock market authorities (the Comisión Nacional de Valores de Argentina) and other regulators of the stock markets on which YPFs stock is traded.  To review and supervise YPFs procedures for the preparation and filing of the following information:  Official notices to the SEC, the Argentine stock market authorities and other regulators of the stock markets on which YPFs stock is traded.  Interim financial reports.  Press releases containing financial data on results, earnings, large acquisitions, divestitures or any other information relevant to the shareholders.  General communications to the shareholders.  Presentations to analysts, investors, rating agencies and lending institutions.  To formulate proposals for an Internal code of conduct on the stock markets that follows applicable rules and regulations or any other standards deemed appropriate. The Disclosure Committee is currently integrated by: Name Position Enrique Locutura Chief Executive Officer Carlos Alberto Olivieri Chief Financial Officer David Esteban Director Accounting and Administration Gonzalo López Fanjul Director Exploration & Production Jesús Guinea Director Refining & Logistics Rafael López Revuelta Director Chemicals Alejandro Quiroga López General Counsel Francisco Javier Macián Director of Human Resources Alfredo Pochintesta Director of Marketing Fabián Falco Director of Communication and External Relations Alicia Schammah Director Management Control José Manuel Gallego Director of Resources Juan Carlos Rodríguez González Director of Internal Audit Gabriel Leiva Manager of Administration 88 Table of Contents Compliance with NYSE Listing Standards on Corporate Governance On November 4, 2003, the SEC approved rules proposed by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) intended to strengthen corporate governance standards for listed companies. Because more than 50% of our voting stock is held by another company, Repsol YPF, we would not be required to comply with the following NYSE corporate governance standards: (i) having a majority of independent directors (as defined by the NYSE), (ii) having the corporate governance committee meet certain conditions, and (iii) having a compensation committee meet certain requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NYSE-listed non-U.S. companies may, in general, follow their home country corporate governance practices in lieu of most of the new NYSE corporate governance requirements. The NYSE rules, however, require that non-U.S. companies disclose any significant ways in which their specific corporate governance practices differ from U.S. companies under the NYSE listing standards. In compliance therewith, the following is a summary of the significant differences between our corporate governance practices and those applicable to U.S. companies under the NYSE listing standards. Independence of the Directors on the Board of Directors In accordance with the NYSE corporate governance rules, a majority of the Board of Directors must be composed of independent directors, the independence of whom is determined in accordance with highly detailed rules promulgated by the NYSE. Argentine law does not regulate the types of directors nor, for that matter, the indispensable requirements to determine their independence. Independence of the Directors on the Audit Committee In accordance with the NYSE corporate governance rules, by July 31, 2005, all members of the Audit Committee must be independent. Independence is determined in accordance with highly detailed rules promulgated by the NYSE. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of YPF was created on May 6, 2004 and approved the Regulations that govern the Audit Committee. It is composed of three independent directors and three alternate members, each elected to one-year term. Compensation and Nomination Committees In accordance with the NYSE corporate governance rules, all U.S. companies listed on the NYSE must have a compensation committee and a nominations committee and all members of such committees must be independent in accordance with highly detailed rules promulgated by the NYSE. Under Argentine law, these committees are not required. Separate Meetings for Non-management Directors In accordance with NYSE corporate governance rules, independent directors must meet periodically outside of the presence of the executive directors. Under Argentine law, this practice is not required and as such, the independent directors on the Board of Directors of YPF do not meet outside of the presence of the rest of the directors. YPF has adopted a code of ethics and conduct applicable to the Board of Directors and to all employees. See Item 16B. Code of Ethics. Compensation of Directors and Officers Argentine law provides that the aggregate annual compensation paid to the members of the Board of Directors (including those directors acting in an executive capacity) with respect to a fiscal year may not exceed 89 Table of Contents 5% of net income for such year if YPF is not paying dividends in respect of such net income, which percentage is increased up to 25% of net income based on the amount of dividends, if any are paid. The compensation of the President and other directors acting in an executive capacity, together with the compensation of all other directors, requires the ratification of an ordinary general shareholders meeting as provided by Argentine law. The compensation of the members of the Supervisory Committee is determined by the ordinary shareholders meeting. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the aggregate compensation accrued or paid to the members of the Board of Directors and YPFs executive officers for services in all capacities was Ps. 19.8 million. During 2005, YPFs performance-based compensation programs included a Bonus Plan for 2,065 employees. The Bonus Plan provides for cash to be paid to the participants based on a measurable and specific set of objectives under Repsol YPFs Management by Objectives program and the results of the review of individual performance. The participants are all YPF employees included at a specific salary level. The participation of each eligible employee in the Bonus Plan ranges from 15% to 55% of such employees annual base salary. Bonus percentages are fixed by the President with the approval of the Compensation Committee at the beginning of each calendar year. The total amount of bonuses awarded under the Bonus Plan cannot exceed 90% of the individual maximum participation and will be linked to the companys net cash flow. In addition, Ps. 1.6 million was accrued for eligible members of the Board of Directors and officers pursuant to the Selected Deferred Compensation Plan. The directors do not have any services contracts with YPF. Employee Matters As of December 31, 2005, YPF had 10,574 employees, including approximately 5,636 employees of the Refining and Marketing business segment, 1,585 employees in the Exploration and Production business segment and 555 employees in the Chemical business segment. Approximately 51% of YPFs employees are represented by one labor union that negotiates labor agreements with YPF. The current labor agreement has a term of two years and expires in December 2006. YPF considers its current relations with its workforce to be good. See Item 8. Financial InformationLegal Proceedings for a description of litigation with certain former employees. As part of its privatization, YPF restructured its internal organization and significantly reduced the number of its employees. YPF reduced its work force from over 51,000 employees (including approximately 15,000 personnel under contract) at December 31, 1990 to approximately 7,500 at December 31, 1993. YPF paid to the employees affected by these reductions the termination payments required under Argentine labor laws which amounted to Ps. 686 million. In connection with the reduction in its workforce, YPF has approximately 4,679 lawsuits brought by former employees as of December 31, 2005. A substantial majority of such suits have been brought by former employees who allege that they received insufficient severance payments in connection with their dismissal, the unsettled YPF stocks, according to the Regime of Participated Property (this regulation was denominated to the sale of the employees YPF stocks), and various job-related illnesses, injuries, typically seek unspecified relief. The outcome of this type of litigation depends on factual issues that vary from case to case, and it is not always feasible to predict the outcome of particular cases. Based on the number and character of the lawsuits already commenced, however, the estimated likelihood of additional claims in view of the number of dismissed employees, applicable statutes of limitations, the legal principles involved in the suits and the financial statement reserves previously established, management of YPF 90 Table of Contents does not expect the outcome of these lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on YPFs financial condition or future results of operations. Maxus has a number of trustee non-contributory pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees. The benefits provided by these plans are based on the number of years of employment and the compensation earned during those years. Maxus has other non-contributory pension plans for executive officers, select key employees and former employees of the Maxus Group. Maxus also grants benefits for health care, life insurance and other social benefits to some of its employees who retire early. The amounts payable accrue over the employees years of service.

Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions In November 1992, the Privatization Law became effective. Pursuant to the Privatization Law, in July 1993, YPF completed a worldwide offering of 160 million Class D Shares, representing approximately 45% of YPFs outstanding capital stock, which had been owned by the Argentine government. Concurrently with the completion of such offering, the Argentine government transferred approximately 40 million Class B Shares to the Argentine provinces, which represented approximately 11% of YPFs outstanding capital stock, and made an offer to holders of pension bonds and certain other claims to exchange such bonds and other claims for approximately 46.1 million Class D Shares, representing approximately 13% of YPFs outstanding capital stock. As a result of these transactions, the Argentine governments ownership percentage of YPFs capital stock was reduced from 100% to approximately 30%, including shares that had been set aside to be offered to employees of YPF upon establishment of the terms and conditions by the Argentine government in accordance with Argentine law. The shares set aside to be offered to employees represented 10% of YPFs outstanding capital stock. The Class A Shares held by the Argentine government became eligible for sale in April 1995 upon the effectiveness of legislation which permitted the Argentine government to sell such shares. A decree issued by the National Executive in connection with the privatization of YPF requires YPF to register sales of Class A Shares 91 Table of Contents and Class B Shares held by the Argentine government and the provinces, respectively, under the States Securities and similar laws in other jurisdictions in which shares of YPF are listed. Approximately 33.8 million of the Class C Shares, set aside for the benefit of employees in connection with YPFs privatization, were sold in a secondary public offering in July 1997. These Class C Shares were converted to Class D Shares upon the transfer. See Item 4: Information on the CompanyHistory and Development of YPFDeregulation, Privatization and Recent Developments. In January 1999, Repsol acquired 52,914,700 Class A Shares in block (14.99% of YPFs shares) which were converted to Class D Shares. Additionally, on April 30, 1999, Repsol announced a tender offer to purchase all outstanding Classes A, B, C and D Share at a price of US$ 44.78 per share (the Offer). Pursuant to the Offer, in June, 1999, Repsol acquired an additional 82.47% of the outstanding capital stock of YPF. On November 4, 1999, Repsol acquired an additional 0.35%. On June 7, 2000, Repsol YPF announced a tender offer to exchange newly issued Repsol YPFs shares for 2.16% of YPFs Class B, C and D Shares held by minority shareholders. Pursuant to the tender offer, and after the merger with Astra, as of December 31, 2001, Repsol YPF owns 389,548,900 Class D shares and therefore controls YPF through a 99.04% ownership interest in YPF. As of May, 2006, there were approximately 224.1 million ADSs outstanding and approximately 99 holders of record of ADSs. Such ADSs represented approximately 57.2% of the total number of issued and outstanding Class D Shares as of April 2006. Excluding ADSs owned by Repsol YPF, outstanding ADSs represent 0.31% of the total number of outstanding Class D Shares. Since Repsol YPF acquired control of YPF, YPF has engaged in various transactions with Repsol YPF. Some of these transactions have involved the transfer of YPFs ownership interest in some subsidiaries to Repsol YPF at fair market value. The most important asset sales are described in 
