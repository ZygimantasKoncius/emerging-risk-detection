Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.” We currently carry general liability insurance and excess liability insurance with a combined annual limit of $101 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. These insurance policies contain maximum policy limits and deductibles ranging from $1,000 to $50,000 that must be met prior to recovery, and are subject to customary exclusions and limitations. Our general liability insurance covers us and our subsidiaries for third-party claims and liabilities arising out of lease operations and related activities. The excess liability insurance is in addition to, and is triggered if, the general liability insurance per occurrence limit is reached. We also maintain control of well insurance and pollution insurance. Our control of well insurance has per occurrence and combined single limits ranging from $3 million to $25 million and is subject to a $500,000 deductible per occurrence. Our pollution insurance has a per occurrence and aggregate annual limit of $30 million and is subject to a $50,000 deductible per occurrence. We require our third-party contractors to sign master service agreements in which they generally agree to indemnify us for the injury and death of the service provider's employees as well as contractors and subcontractors that are hired by the service provider. Similarly, we agree to indemnify our third-party contractors against claims made by our employees and our other contractors. Additionally, each party generally is responsible for damage to its own property. 25Table of ContentsOur third-party contractors that perform hydraulic fracturing operations for us sign master service agreements containing the indemnification provisions noted above. We do not currently have any insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations. We believe that our general liability, excess liability and pollution insurance policies would cover third-party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses, in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies. However, these policies may not cover fines, penalties or costs and expenses related to government-mandated environmental clean-up responsibilities. Our employees As of December 31, 2013, we employed 755 persons. None of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. To date, we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages due to labor problems, and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. We also utilize the services of independent consultants and contractors.

We caution users of the financial statements not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. When considering our forward-looking statements, keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risk factors noted in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Please see “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain risks related to our business, indebtedness and common stock.Our revenues, operating results and financial condition depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and the availability of capital from the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. Declines in oil or natural gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, the amount of oil or natural gas that we can produce economically and the ability to fund our operations. Historically, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile.Glossary of selected oil and natural gas terms The following are abbreviations and definitions of terms commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry and this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 2-D seismic. Geophysical data that depicts the subsurface strata in two dimensions. 3-D seismic. Geophysical data that depicts the subsurface strata in three dimensions. 3-D seismic typically provides a more detailed and accurate interpretation of the subsurface strata than 2-D seismic. Appraisal wells. Wells drilled to convert an area or sub-region from the resource to the reserves category. Analogous reservoir. Analogous reservoirs, as used in resources assessments, have similar rock and fluid properties, reservoir conditions (depth, temperature, and pressure) and drive mechanisms, but are typically at a more advanced stage of development than the reservoir of interest and thus may provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of more limited data and estimation of recovery. When used to support proved reserves, an “analogous reservoir” refers to a reservoir that shares the following characteristics with the reservoir of interest: (i) same geological formation (but not necessarily in pressure communication with the reservoir of interest); (ii) same environment of deposition; (iii) similar geological structure; and (iv) same drive mechanism.Bbl.

One billion cubic feet equivalent calculated by converting one Bbl of oil or NGLs to six Mcf of natural gas. This ratio of Bbl to Mcf is commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry and represents the approximate energy equivalent of natural gas to oil or NGLs, and does not represent the sales price equivalency of natural gas to oil or NGLs. Currently the sales price of a Bbl or NGL is significantly higher than the sales price of six Mcf of natural gas.Boepd. Barrels of oil equivalent per day. Btu. British thermal unit, which is the heat required to raise the temperature of a one pound mass of water from 58.5 to 59.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Completion.

The continuing development of a known producing formation in a previously discovered field. To maximize the ultimate recovery of oil or natural gas from the field by development wells, secondary recovery equipment or other suitable processes and technology. Exploratory well. An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or natural gas in another reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, a service well, or a stratigraphic test well. Farmout. An assignment of an interest in a drilling location and related acreage conditional upon the drilling of a well on that location. Formation. A succession of sedimentary beds that were deposited under the same general geologic conditions. Fracture stimulation. A stimulation treatment routinely performed involving the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure to stimulate hydrocarbon production. Full cost pool. The full cost pool consists of all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration, and development activities for a company using the full cost method of accounting. Additionally, any internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition, exploration and development activities are included. Any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities are not included. Gross acres or gross wells. The total acres or wells, as the case may be, in which a working interest is owned. Held-by-production. A provision in an oil, natural gas and mineral lease that perpetuates a company's right to operate a property or concession as long as the property or concession produces a minimum paying quantity of oil or natural gas. Horizontal wells. Wells which are drilled at angles greater than 70 degrees from vertical. Initial production rate. Generally, the maximum 24 hour production volume from a well. Mbbl.

One million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent calculated by converting one Bbl of oil or NGLs to six Mcf of natural gas. This ratio of Bbl to Mcf is commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry and represents the approximate energy equivalent of natural gas to oil or NGLs, and does not represent the sales price equivalency of natural gas to oil or NGLs. Currently the sales price of a Bbl or NGL is significantly higher than the sales price of six Mcf of natural gas. Mmcfe/d. One million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day calculated by converting one Bbl of oil or NGLs to six Mcf of natural gas. Mmmbtu. One billion British thermal units. Net acres or net wells.

Overriding royalty interest. An interest in an oil and/or natural gas property entitling the owner to a share of oil and natural gas production free of the costs of production. Pad drilling. The drilling of multiple wells from the same site. Play. A term applied to a portion of the exploration and production cycle following the identification by geologists and geophysicists of areas with potential oil and natural gas reserves. Present value of estimated future net revenues or PV-10. The present value of estimated future net revenues is an estimate of future net revenues from a property at the date indicated, without giving effect to derivative financial instrument activities, after deducting production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs, abandonment costs and operating expenses, but before deducting future income taxes. The future net revenues have been discounted at an annual rate of 10% to determine their “present value.” The present value is shown to indicate the effect of time on the value of the net revenue stream and should not be construed as being the fair market value of the properties. Estimates have been made using constant oil and natural gas prices and operating and capital costs at the date indicated, at its acquisition date, or as otherwise indicated. Probabilistic method. The method of estimation of reserves or resources when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each unknown parameter (from the geoscience and engineering data) is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of occurrence. Productive well. A productive well is a well that is not a dry well. Proved Developed Reserves. These reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered: (i) through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and (ii) through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Proved Reserves. Proved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with Reasonable Certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: (i) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with Reasonable Certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with Reasonable Certainty. Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with Reasonable Certainty. Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when: (i) successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the Reasonable Certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and (ii) the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 29Table of ContentsProved Undeveloped Reserves. Reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes Reasonable Certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing Reasonable Certainty. Recompletion. An operation within an existing well bore to make the well produce oil and/or natural gas from a different, separately producible zone other than the zone from which the well had been producing. Reasonable Certainty. If deterministic methods are used, Reasonable Certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery ("EUR") with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. Resources. Resources are quantities of oil and natural gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. A portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable, and another portion may be considered to be unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations. Royalty interest. An interest in an oil and/or natural gas property entitling the owner to a share of oil and natural gas production free of the costs of production. Shale. Fine-grained sedimentary rock composed mostly of consolidated clay or mud. Shale is the most frequently occurring sedimentary rock. Shut-in well. A producing well that has been closed down temporarily for, among other things, economics, cleaning out, building up pressure, lack of a market or lack of equipment. Spud. To start the well drilling process. Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows or the Standardized Measure. Under the Standardized Measure, future cash flows are estimated by applying the simple average spot prices for the trailing 12 month period using the first day of each month beginning on January 1 and ending on December 1 of each respective year, adjusted for price differentials, to the estimated future production of year-end Proved Reserves. Future cash inflows are reduced by estimated future production and development costs based on period-end and future plugging and abandonment costs to determine pre-tax cash inflows. Future income taxes are computed by applying the statutory tax rate to the excess of pre-tax cash inflows over our tax basis in the associated properties. Future net cash inflows after income taxes are discounted using a 10% annual discount rate to arrive at the Standardized Measure. Stock tank barrel. 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume. Tcf. One trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Tcfe. One trillion cubic feet equivalent calculated by converting one Bbl of oil or NGLs to six Mcf of natural gas. This ratio of Bbl to Mcf is commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry and represents the approximate energy equivalent of natural gas to oil or NGLs, and does not represent the sales price equivalency of natural gas to oil or NGLs. Currently the sales price of a Bbl or NGL is significantly higher than the sales price for six Mcf of natural gas.Undeveloped acreage. Leased acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains Proved Reserves. Working interest. The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct activities on the property and a share of production. Workovers. Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production. 30Table of ContentsAvailable information We make available, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports on our website at www.excoresources.com as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports and other information is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Item 1A.Risk Factors The risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks identified in “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” describe examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Risks Relating to Our BusinessFluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which have been volatile at times, may adversely affect our revenues as well as our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, repay current or future indebtedness and obtain additional capital on attractive terms.Our future financial condition, access to capital, cash flow and results of operations depend upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas. We are particularly dependent on prices for natural gas. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 90% of our Proved Reserves were natural gas and approximately 95% of our production was natural gas. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Factors that affect the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas include:•supply and demand for oil and natural gas and expectations regarding supply and demand;•the level of domestic production;•the availability of imported oil and natural gas;•political and economic conditions and events in foreign oil and natural gas producing nations, including embargoes, continued hostilities in the Middle East and other sustained military campaigns, and acts of terrorism or sabotage;•the ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;•the cost and availability of transportation and pipeline systems with adequate capacity;•the cost and availability of other competitive fuels;•fluctuating and seasonal demand for oil, natural gas and refined products;•concerns about global warming or other conservation initiatives and the extent of governmental price controls and regulation of production;•regional price differentials and quality differentials of oil and natural gas;•the availability of refining capacity;•technological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;•weather conditions and natural disasters;•foreign and domestic government relations; and•overall economic conditions. In the past, prices of oil and natural gas have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. During 2013, the NYMEX price for natural gas fluctuated from a high of $4.46 per Mmbtu to a low of $3.11 per Mmbtu, while the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil price ranged from a high of $110.53 per Bbl to a low of $86.68 per Bbl. For the five years ended December 31, 2013, the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from a high of $6.07 per Mmbtu to a low of $1.91 per Mmbtu, while the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil price ranged from a high of $113.93 per Bbl to a low of $33.98 per Bbl. On December 31, 2013, the spot market price for natural gas at Henry Hub was $4.23 per Mmbtu, a 26% increase from December 31, 2012. On December 31, 2013, the spot market price for crude oil at Cushing was $98.42 per Bbl, a 7% increase from December 31, 2012. For 2013, our average realized prices (before the impact of derivative financial instruments) for oil and natural gas were $93.80 per Bbl and $3.35 per Mcf, respectively, compared with 2012 average realized prices of $88.24 per Bbl and $2.53 per Mcf, respectively. 31Table of ContentsOur revenues, cash flow and profitability and our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, to repay current or future indebtedness and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms depend substantially upon oil and natural gas prices.Changes in the differential between NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price used to price our actual oil and natural gas sales could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.The reference or regional index prices that we use to price our oil and natural gas sales sometimes reflect a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we reference in our sales contracts is called a differential. We cannot accurately predict oil and natural gas differentials. Changes in differentials between the benchmark price for oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price we reference in our sales contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have recently experienced significant volatility in our price differentials including crude oil production from the Eagle Ford shale and natural gas production in certain areas in Appalachia. Our crude oil production from the Eagle Ford shale is currently sold at a price based on the Phillips 66 West Texas Intermediate index plus or minus the differential to the Argus Louisiana Light Sweet index. During 2013, this differential ranged from a high of $21.98 per barrel to a low of $2.20 per barrel. Our natural gas production from the Marcellus shale in Northeast Pennsylvania is sold at a price based on a Platts index that represents value into the Transco Leidy Pipeline. Due to the increased production in this region without an offsetting increase in pipeline capacity or infrastructure to the Northeast United States markets, this differential in 2013 ranged from a high of NYMEX less $0.02 per Mmbtu to a low of NYMEX less $1.86 per Mmbtu. These differentials vary depending on factors such as supply, demand, pipeline capacity, infrastructure, and weather. There are risks associated with our drilling activity that could impact our results of operations and financial condition.Our drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. We must incur significant expenditures to identify and acquire properties and to drill and complete wells. Additionally, seismic and other technology does not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or economically producible. The costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents, weather conditions and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. We have experienced some delays in contracting for drilling rigs, obtaining fracture stimulation crews and materials, which result in increased costs to drill wells. Also, we may experience issues with the availability of water used in our drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities. All of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our ability to develop properties in new or emerging formations may be subject to more uncertainties than drilling in areas that are more developed or have a longer history of established production.The results of our drilling in new or emerging formations, including the Eagle Ford shale formation, are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are developed, have established production or where we have a longer history of operation. Because new or emerging formations have limited or no production history, we are less able to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict future drilling results. Further, part of our strategy for the Eagle Ford shale formation involves the use of horizontal drilling and completion techniques that have been successful in other shale formations. Our experience with horizontal drilling in these areas to date, as well as the industry’s drilling and production history, while growing, is limited. The ultimate success of these drilling and completion techniques will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are better established. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, and/or natural gas and oil prices decline, our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate and we could incur material impairments of undeveloped properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Market conditions or operational impediments, such as lack of available transportation or infrastructure, may hinder our production or adversely impact our ability to receive market prices for our production or to achieve expected drilling results.Market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements or infrastructure may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the 32Table of Contentsproximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends, in substantial part, on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines, processing facilities and oil and condensate trucking operations owned and operated by third-parties. Our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be required to shut in wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of crude oil or natural gas pipelines, gathering systems or trucking capacity. A portion of our production may also be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous other reasons, including as a result of accidents, excessive pressures, maintenance, weather, field labor issues or other disruptions of service. Curtailments and disruptions may last from a few days to several months, and we have no control over when or if third-party facilities are restored.In the past we have experienced production curtailments due to infrastructure and market constraints in the Eagle Ford shale formation, which has caused natural gas production to either be shut in or flared. Any significant curtailment in gathering, processing or pipeline system capacity, significant delay in the construction of necessary facilities or lack of availability of transportation would interfere with our ability to market our oil and natural gas production, and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations.We depend on Chesapeake to market our oil and natural gas production in the Eagle Ford shale. If Chesapeake is unable or otherwise fails to market our Eagle Ford production, our revenues could be adversely affected.We have entered into marketing agreements with an affiliate of Chesapeake to sell all of the anticipated oil and natural gas production associated with the acreage we acquired from Chesapeake in the Eagle Ford shale formation. If Chesapeake is unable or otherwise fails to market the oil and natural gas we produce from the Eagle Ford shale formation, we would be required to find alternate means to market our production, which could increase our costs, reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our oil and natural gas or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.We conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint ventures, and our failure to continue such joint ventures or resolve any material disagreements with our partners could have a material adverse effect on the success of these operations, our financial condition and our results of operations.We conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint ventures with third parties, principally BG Group, HGI and KKR, and as a result, the continuation of such joint ventures is vital to our continued success. We may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. In many instances we depend on these third parties for elements of these arrangements that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as agreed payments of substantial development costs pertaining to the joint venture and their share of other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these third party obligations or the ability of third parties to meet their obligations under these arrangements is outside our control. If these parties do not meet or satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, the performance and success of these arrangements, and their value to us, may be adversely affected. If our current or future joint venture partners are unable to meet their obligations, we may be forced to undertake the obligations ourselves and/or incur additional expenses in order to have some other party perform such obligations. In such cases we may also be required to enforce our rights, which may cause disputes among our joint venture partners and us. If any of these events occur, they may adversely impact us, our financial performance and results of operations, these joint ventures and/or our ability to enter into future joint ventures. In addition, we are required to present opportunities related to the development of certain conventional assets to the EXCO/HGI Partnership. BG Group also has the right to elect to participate in all acreage and other acquisitions in defined areas of mutual interest in the Haynesville and Appalachia regions. If they elect not to participate in a particular transaction or transactions, we would bear the entire cost of the acquisition and all development costs of the acquired properties.Such joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when exploring and developing properties directly, including, for example:•our joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;•the possibility that our joint venture partners might become insolvent or bankrupt, leaving us liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities;•the possibility that we may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by our joint venture partners;•joint venture partners may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives;•disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses, delay or terminate projects and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business;33Table of Contents•that under certain joint venture arrangements, neither joint venture partner may have the power to control the venture, and an impasse could be reached which might have a negative influence on our investment in the joint venture; and•our joint venture partners may decide to terminate their relationship with us in any joint venture company or sell their interest in any of these companies and we may be unable to replace such joint venture partner or raise the necessary financing to purchase such joint venture partner’s interest. The failure to continue some of our joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with our joint venture partners could adversely affect our ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.We may make significant capital expenditures and be subject to certain legal and financial terms as the result of our joint ventures with BG Group that could adversely affect us.We are a party to a joint venture with BG Group covering an undivided 50% interest in a substantial portion of our shale assets in the East Texas/North Louisiana area including the Haynesville/Bossier shale, or the East Texas/North Louisiana JV. The East Texas/North Louisiana JV operates as a joint venture pursuant to a joint development agreement under which EXCO acts as the operator.We are also party to a joint venture with BG Group covering our Marcellus shale acreage and shallow producing assets in the Appalachia region ("Appalachia JV"). Pursuant to the agreements governing the Appalachia JV, EXCO and BG Group agreed to jointly explore and develop their Appalachian properties, particularly the Marcellus shale. EXCO and BG Group each own a 50% interest in the operating entity that operates the Appalachia JV’s properties subject to oversight from a management board having equal representation from EXCO and BG Group. In addition, certain midstream assets owned by EXCO and BG Group are party to a midstream joint venture in Appalachia through which they will pursue the construction and expansion of gathering systems, pipeline systems and treating facilities for anticipated future production from the Marcellus shale. EXCO has unconditionally guaranteed its subsidiaries’ performance of the joint venture agreements under the Appalachia joint ventures.Each of these joint ventures may require us to make significant capital expenditures. If we do not timely meet our financial commitments under the respective joint venture agreements, our rights to participate in such joint ventures will be adversely affected and other parties to the joint ventures may have a right to acquire a share of our interest in such joint ventures proportionate to, and in satisfaction of, our unmet financial obligations. Our use of derivative financial instruments is subject to risks that our counterparties may default on their contractual obligations to us and may cause us to forego additional future profits or result in us making cash payments. To reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas, we have entered into, and may in the future enter into, derivative financial instrument arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production. The agreements that we have entered into generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed price for a portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production over a fixed period of time. Our derivative financial instruments are subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment. The change in the fair market value of these instruments is reported as a non-cash item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations each quarter, which typically results in significant variability in our net income. Derivative financial instruments expose us to the risk of financial loss and may limit our ability to benefit from increases in oil and natural gas prices in some circumstances, including the following:•market prices may exceed the prices which we are contracted to receive, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments;•there may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative financial instrument agreement and actual prices received; or•the counterparty to the derivative financial instrument contract may default on its contractual obligations to us. Our use of derivative financial instruments could have the effect of reducing our revenues and the value of our securities. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we received cash receipts to settle our derivative financial instrument contracts totaling $42.1 million and $202.1 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, a $1.00 increase in the average commodity price per Mcfe would have resulted in an increase in cash settlement payments (or a decrease in settlements received) of approximately $91.9 million. As of December 31, 2013, our oil and natural gas derivative financial instrument contracts were in the net liability position of $6.5 million. The ultimate settlement amount of these unrealized derivative financial instrument contracts is dependent on future commodity prices. We may incur significant realized and unrealized losses 34Table of Contentsin the future from our use of derivative financial instruments to the extent market prices increase and our derivatives contracts remain in place.To fund the acquisitions of oil and natural gas assets in the Haynesville and Eagle Ford shale formations, we incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.To finance the acquisitions of the oil and natural gas assets in the Haynesville and Eagle Ford shale formations from Chesapeake, we entered into the amended EXCO Resources Credit Agreement on July 31, 2013. As of January 31, 2014, the revolving commitment under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement had an available borrowing base of approximately $900.0 million, with approximately $491.0 million of outstanding indebtedness and $402.1 million of unused borrowing base, net of letters of credit.Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to repay our indebtedness, including our 7.5% senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2018 ("2018 Notes") and the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, to fund planned capital expenditures and to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flow, capital resources and planned asset sales are insufficient to repay our debt obligations and finance capital expenditure programs, we may be forced to sell additional assets, issue additional equity or debt securities or restructure our indebtedness. These options may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, the sale of assets or issuance of debt securities would have to be completed in compliance with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and holders of the 2018 Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Further, failing to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement or the indenture governing the 2018 Notes could result in an event of default, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we are unable to complete the joint development of our assets in the Eagle Ford shale formations with KKR, we may need to find alternative sources of capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.On July 31, 2013, we closed the acquisition of certain producing and non-producing oil, natural gas and mineral leases and wells in the Eagle Ford shale located in Zavala, Dimmit and Frio counties in South Texas. In connection with the closing of the acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets, we sold an undivided 50% interest in the undeveloped acreage to affiliates of KKR for approximately $130.9 million. With respect to each well drilled, EXCO will assign half of its undivided 50% interest in such well to KKR such that KKR will fund and own 75% of each well drilled and EXCO will fund and own 25% of each well drilled. There can be no assurance that KKR will elect to proceed with subsequent phases of the development of our Eagle Ford assets. If we cannot identify an alternative joint venture partner or partners for our Eagle Ford assets, sell assets at acceptable valuations or are unable to complete the joint development of our Eagle Ford assets, we will need to utilize cash flow from other operations or will need to find alternative sources of capital to finance the development of the Eagle Ford assets, which may slow the development of these assets and have a material adverse effect on our operations and prospects.While we are required to make offers to purchase KKR’s interest in certain wells, we may not have sufficient funds or borrowing capacity under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement to complete the acquisitions pursuant to the KKR Participation Agreement. In the event we fail to purchase a group of wells that KKR is obligated to sell, there are remedies available to KKR which allow KKR to reject future EXCO offers, terminate the KKR Participation Agreement, or pursue other legal remedies. This could require us to seek alternative financing to make offers to preserve KKR’s obligation to sell to us, or negatively impact our ability to increase our Eagle Ford assets via acquisitions of KKR’s producing properties.We may be unable to obtain additional financing to implement our growth strategy.The growth of our business will require substantial capital on a continuing basis. Due to the amount of debt we have incurred, it may be difficult for us in the foreseeable future to obtain additional debt financing or to obtain additional secured financing other than purchase money indebtedness. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms and conditions or at all, we may lose opportunities to acquire oil and natural gas properties and businesses and, therefore, be unable to implement our growth strategy.35Table of ContentsWe may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves, which would reduce our revenues and access to capital.Our success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are profitable to produce. Factors that may hinder our ability to acquire or develop additional oil and natural gas reserves include competition, access to capital, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and the number and attractiveness of properties for sale. If we are unable to conduct successful development activities or acquire properties containing Proved Reserves, our total Proved Reserves will generally decline as a result of production. Also, our production will generally decline. In addition, if our reserves and production decline, then the amount we are able to borrow under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement will also decline. We may be unable to locate additional reserves, drill economically productive wells or acquire properties containing Proved Reserves. Acquisitions, development drilling and exploration drilling are the main methods of replacing reserves. However, development and exploration drilling operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons. Our future oil and natural gas production depends on our success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. If we fail to replace reserves through drilling or acquisitions, our level of production and cash flows will be adversely affected.We may not identify all risks associated with the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties, and any indemnification we receive from sellers may be insufficient to protect us from such risks, which may result in unexpected liabilities and costs to us.Generally, it is not feasible for us to review in detail every individual property involved in an acquisition. Our business strategy focuses on acquisitions of producing oil and natural gas properties. Any future acquisitions will require an assessment of recoverable reserves, title, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental hazards and liabilities, potential tax and Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 liabilities, other liabilities and similar factors. Ordinarily, our review efforts are focused on the higher-valued properties. Even a detailed review of properties and records may not reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well that we acquire. Potential problems, such as deficiencies in the mechanical integrity of equipment or environmental conditions that may require significant remedial expenditures, are not necessarily observable even when we inspect a well. Any unidentified problems from acquisitions could result in material liabilities and costs that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.Even if we are able to identify problems with an acquisition, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection or indemnify us against all or part of these problems. Even if a seller agrees to provide indemnification, the indemnification may not be fully enforceable and may be limited by floors and caps on such indemnification.We have entered into significant natural gas firm transportation and marketing agreements primarily in East Texas and North Louisiana that require us to pay fixed amounts of money to the shippers or marketers regardless of quantities actually shipped or marketed. If we are unable to deliver the necessary quantities of natural gas, our results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected.We have entered into significant natural gas firm transportation contracts primarily in East Texas and North Louisiana that require us to pay fixed amounts of money to the shippers regardless of quantities actually shipped. The use of firm transportation agreements allows us priority space in a shippers’ pipeline. In the event the quantities delivered under these arrangements are significantly below the minimum volumes within the agreements, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we have also entered into a marketing agreement with respect to our Haynesville production whereby we are required to deliver a minimum amount of natural gas from the Haynesville shale. We will be required to make material expenditures for these agreements if we fail to deliver the required quantities of natural gas in the future. To the extent that we do not produce and deliver sufficient natural gas production, the requirements to pay for quantities not delivered could have a material impact on our results of operations and liquidity. We may encounter obstacles to marketing our oil and natural gas, which could adversely impact our revenues.Our ability to market our oil and natural gas production will depend upon the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and other transportation facilities. We are primarily dependent upon third parties to transport our products. Transportation space on the gathering systems and pipelines we utilize is occasionally limited or unavailable due to repairs, outages caused by accidents or other events, or improvements to facilities or due to space being utilized by other companies that have priority transportation agreements. We have experienced production curtailments in East Texas/North Louisiana 36Table of Contentsresulting from capacity restraints, offsetting fracturing stimulation operations and short term shutdowns of certain pipelines for maintenance purposes. As we have increased our knowledge of the Haynesville/Bossier shale plays, we have begun to shut in production on adjacent wells when conducting completion operations. Due to the high production capabilities of these wells, these volumes can be significant. Our access to transportation options can also be affected by U.S. federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand. These factors and the availability of markets are beyond our control. If market factors dramatically change, the impact on our revenues could be substantial and could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas, the value of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.We may not correctly evaluate reserve data or the exploitation potential of properties as we engage in our acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation activities.Our future success will depend on the success of our acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation activities. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit properties or prospects will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. These decisions could significantly reduce our ability to generate cash needed to service our debt and fund our capital program and other working capital requirements.We may be unable to integrate successfully the operations of acquisitions with our operations and we may not realize all the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions.Integration of our acquisitions with our business and operations has been a complex, time consuming and costly process. Failure to successfully assimilate our past or future acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Our acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:•operating a significantly larger combined organization and adding operations;•difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired business, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographic area;•the risk that oil and natural gas reserves acquired may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;•the loss of significant key employees from the acquired business;•the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;•the failure to realize expected profitability or growth;•the failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings;•coordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities; and•coordinating or consolidating corporate and administrative functions. Further, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition. If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and you may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions. Our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves involve inherent uncertainty, which could materially affect the quantity and value of our reported reserves, our financial condition and the value of our common stock.Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of Proved Reserves, including many factors beyond our control. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains estimates of our Proved Reserves and the PV-10 and Standardized Measure of our Proved Reserves. These estimates are based upon reports of our independent petroleum engineers. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. These estimates should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated Proved Reserves.The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. As a result, the estimates are inherently imprecise evaluations of reserve quantities and future net revenue and such estimates prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially.37Table of ContentsOur actual future production, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from those we have assumed in the estimates. Any significant variance in our assumptions could materially affect the quantity and value of reserves, the amount of PV-10 and Standardized Measure described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our financial condition. In addition, our reserves, the amount of PV-10 and Standardized Measure may be revised downward or upward, based upon production history, results of future exploitation and development activities, prevailing oil and natural gas prices, decisions and assumptions made by engineers and other factors. A material decline in prices paid for our production can adversely impact the estimated volumes and values of our reserves. Similarly, a decline in market prices for oil or natural gas may adversely affect our PV-10 and Standardized Measure. Any of these negative effects on our reserves or PV-10 and Standardized Measure may negatively affect the value of our common stock.We are exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.Our operations are subject to the risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including the risks of:•fires, explosions and blowouts;•pipe failures;•abnormally pressured formations; and•environmental accidents such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases, brine or well fluids into the environment (including groundwater contamination).We have in the past experienced some of these events during our drilling, production and midstream operations. These events may result in substantial losses to us from:•injury or loss of life;•severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;•pollution or other environmental damage;•environmental clean-up responsibilities;•regulatory investigation;•penalties and suspension of operations; or•attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation.As is customary in our industry, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these potential losses or liabilities. Furthermore, insurance coverage may not continue to be available at commercially acceptable premium levels or at all. Due to cost considerations, from time to time we have declined to obtain coverage for certain drilling activities. We do not carry business interruption insurance. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or under-insured events could require us to make large unbudgeted cash expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.Our operations may be interrupted by severe weather or drilling restrictions.Our operations are conducted primarily in Texas, North Louisiana and Appalachia. The weather in these areas can be extreme and can cause interruption in our exploration and production operations. Severe weather can result in damage to our facilities entailing longer operational interruptions and significant capital investment. Likewise, our operations are subject to disruption from hurricanes, winter storms and severe cold, which can limit operations involving fluids and impair access to our facilities. Additionally, many municipalities in Appalachia impose weight restrictions on the paved roads that lead to our jobsites due to the conditions caused by spring thaws.We are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations.Our oil and natural gas development and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations.38Table of ContentsOur business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration for, production and sale of, oil and natural gas. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.The Obama administration’s budget proposals for fiscal year 2014 contain numerous proposed tax changes, and from time to time, legislation has been introduced that would enact many of these proposed changes. The proposed budget and legislation would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by U.S. oil and gas companies and impose new fees. Among others, the provisions include: elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; repeal of the percentage depletion deduction for oil and gas properties; repeal of the domestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies; increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers; and implementation of a fee on non-producing federal oil and gas leases. The passage of legislation containing some or all of these provisions or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available to us with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The EPA’s implementation of climate change regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our oil and natural gas production.Although federal legislation regarding the control of emissions of GHGs for the present appears unlikely, the EPA has been implementing regulations under existing CAA authority, some of which may affect our operations. GHGs are certain gases, including carbon dioxide, a product of the combustion of natural gas, and methane, a primary component of natural gas, that may be contributing to the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere, resulting in climatic changes. These GHG regulations could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our oil and natural gas production.The EPA has adopted GHG rules that require federal prevention of significant deterioration permit requirements for new sources and modifications, and Title V operating permits for all sources, that have the potential to emit specific quantities of GHGs. Those permitting provisions could require controls or other measures to reduce GHG emissions from new or modified sources, and we could incur additional costs to satisfy those requirements. The EPA has also adopted rules establishing GHG reporting requirements for sources in the petroleum and natural gas industry requiring those sources to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their GHG emissions. We are subject to these rules and the applicable GHG reporting requirements. Although these rules do not limit the amount of GHGs that can be emitted, they require us to incur costs to monitor, recordkeep and report GHG emissions associated with our operations.The adoption of derivatives legislation and regulations thereunder could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act"). The Dodd-Frank Act establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in the market and requires the Commodities Future Trading Commission ("CFTC"), federal regulators of banks and other financial institutions and the SEC to implement the new law by promulgating regulations relating to derivatives transactions, including the derivatives transactions we use to hedge our exposure to commodity price volatility.Under the Dodd-Frank Act and related reforms, over-the-counter derivatives dealers and other over-the-counter major market participants could be subjected to substantial regulatory supervision. The reforms expand the power of the CFTC to regulate derivatives transactions related to energy commodities, including oil and natural gas, to mandate clearance of derivatives contracts through registered derivatives clearing organizations and to impose burdensome capital and margin requirements and business conduct standards on over-the-counter derivatives transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act also permits the CFTC to set position limits on certain derivatives instruments. In October 2011, the CFTC issued a rule to implement position limits for certain futures and options contracts on certain commodities and for swaps that are their economic equivalents (with exemptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions). Following a challenge in federal court by the Securities Industry Financial Markets Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the CFTC’s rule on position limits was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012 and remanded to the CFTC to resolve ambiguity as to whether statutory requirements for such limits to be determined necessary and appropriate were satisfied. As a result, such position limits have not yet taken effect, although the CFTC did issue a new set of proposed position limit rules in November 2013 and has taken the position that the Dodd-Frank 39Table of ContentsAct requires the CFTC to impose such position limits. The impact of such regulations upon our business is not yet clear. Certain of our hedging and trading activities, and those of our counterparties, may be subject to such position limits, which may reduce our ability to enter into hedging transactions.The reforms may also require us to comply with margin and clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our derivatives activities, although whether and the extent to which these requirements will apply to our business is uncertain at this time. Further, the reforms may also require our counterparties to spin off derivatives activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the original counterparties.The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related reforms and regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. If the reforms ultimately require that we post margin for our hedging activities or require our counterparties to hold margin or maintain required minimum capital levels, the cost of which could be passed through to us, or impose other requirements that are more burdensome that current regulations, hedges could become significantly more expensive (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect available liquidity), uneconomic or unavailable, which could lead to increased costs, commodity price volatility, reductions in commodity prices, or any combination of the foregoing. Further, such developments could reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivatives contracts, subject us to additional capital or margin requirements, restrict our flexibility in conducting trading activity and taking commodity positions, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives contracts as a result of the new requirements, our results of operations may become more volatile and cash flows less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is lower commodity prices. Individually and collectively, these factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks and on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production. Most hydraulic fracturing (other than hydraulic fracturing using diesel) is exempted from regulation under the SDWA. Congress has considered legislation to amend the federal SDWA to remove the exemption from regulation and permitting that is applicable to hydraulic fracturing operations and require reporting and disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Sponsors of bills previously introduced before the Senate and House of Representatives have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies. Such bills or similar legislation, if adopted, could increase the possibility of litigation and establish an additional level of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens, making it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increasing our costs of compliance. At the state and local levels, some jurisdictions have adopted, and others are considering adopting, requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, as well as bans on hydraulic fracturing activities. In the event that new or more stringent state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we have properties, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.In addition, the EPA has recently been taking action to assert federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using diesel under the SDWA’s Underground Injection Control Program ("UIC"). Further, in March 2010, the EPA announced that it would conduct a wide-ranging study on the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. Interim results of the study are expected in 2012, with final results expected in 2014. The agency also announced that one of its enforcement initiatives for 2014 through 2016 would be to focus on environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector. This study and enforcement initiative could result in additional regulatory scrutiny that could make it difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. Consequently, these studies and initiatives could spur further legislative or regulatory action regarding hydraulic fracturing or similar production operations.In addition, the EPA recently issued guidance under the SDWA providing direction on how it will address the use of diesel in hydraulic fracturing activities and how its UIC will be applied to such hydraulic fracturing activities. Moreover, the EPA has announced that it will develop effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. The Bureau of Land Management has proposed 40Table of Contentsdraft rules to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and the EPA has announced an initiative under the Toxic Substances Control Act to develop regulations governing the disclosure and evaluation of hydraulic fracturing chemicals. If hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements or operations restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we ultimately are able to produce. Our business exposes us to liability and extensive regulation on environmental matters, which could result in substantial expenditures.Our operations are subject to numerous complex U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of materials into the water and air, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. Laws, rules and regulations protecting the environment have changed frequently and the changes often include increasingly stringent requirements. We could incur material costs, including clean-up costs, fines and civil and criminal sanctions (including injunctive relief) and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own activities, but may also expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for actions by us that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, we could incur substantial expenditures complying with environmental laws and regulations, including future environmental laws and regulations which may be more stringent, for example, the regulation of GHG emissions under the federal CAA, or state or regional regulatory programs. Regulation of GHG emissions by the EPA, or various states in the United States in areas in which we conduct business, for example, could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for our oil and natural gas production. Moreover, the EPA has shown a general increased scrutiny on the oil and gas industry through its GHG, CAA and SDWA regulations.The EPA has adopted rules subjecting oil and natural gas operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS"), and the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, ("NESHAPS"), programs under the CAA, and imposing new and amended requirements under both programs. Among other things, the rule amends standards applicable to natural gas processing plants and expands the NSPS to include all oil and natural gas operations, imposing requirements on those operations. The rule also imposes NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. These standards include the reduced emission completion techniques. The NESHAPS also includes maximum achievable control technology standards for certain glycol dehydrators and storage vessels, and revises applicability provisions, alternative test protocols and the availability of the startup, shutdown and maintenance exemption. The implementation of these new requirements may result in increased operating and compliance costs, increased regulatory burdens and delays in our operations.We may have impairments of our asset values, which could negatively affect our results of operations and net worth.We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Depending upon oil and natural gas prices in the future, and at the end of each quarterly and annual period when we are required to test the carrying value of our assets using full cost accounting rules, we may be required to record an impairment to the value of our oil and natural gas properties if the present value of the after-tax future cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of these properties. We have in the past experienced, and may experience in the future, ceiling test impairments with respect to our oil and natural gas properties. Given the short passage of time between the closing of the acquisition of Haynesville and Eagle Ford assets from Chesapeake during July 2013 and the required ceiling test computation, we requested, and received, an exemption from the SEC to exclude these acquired properties from the ceiling test assessments for a period of 12 months following the corresponding acquisition dates. The request for exemption was made because the ceiling test requires companies using the full cost accounting method to price period ending Proved Reserves using the simple average spot price for the trailing 12 month period, which may not be indicative of actual market values. We will assess these acquisitions for impairment during the requested exemption period. Further, if we cannot demonstrate that fair value exceeds the unamortized carrying costs during the requested exemption periods prior to issuance of our financial statements, we are required to recognize an impairment. Our evaluation of impairment is based upon estimates of Proved Reserves. The value of our Proved Reserves may be lowered in future periods as a result of a decline in prices of oil and natural gas, a downward revision of our oil and natural gas reserves or other factors. As a result, our evaluation of impairment for future periods is subject to uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of Proved Reserves, in projecting the future rates of production and in the timing of development activities. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Because several of these factors are beyond our control, we cannot accurately predict or control 41Table of Contentsthe amount of ceiling test impairments in future periods. Future ceiling test impairments could negatively affect our results of operations and net worth.For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 we recognized impairments of $108.5 million, $1.3 billion and $233.2 million, respectively, to our proved oil and natural gas properties. We may have additional impairments of our oil and natural gas properties in future periods if the cost of our unamortized proved oil and natural gas properties exceeds the limitation under the full cost method of accounting. We also test goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. If the book value of our reporting units exceeds the estimated fair value of those reporting units, an impairment charge will occur, which would negatively impact our results of operations and net worth. As a result of our testing of goodwill for impairment, we did not record an impairment charge for the periods ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. We may experience a financial loss if any of our significant customers fail to pay us for our oil or natural gas.Our ability to collect payments from the sale of oil and natural gas to our customers depends on the payment ability of our customer base, which includes several significant customers. If any one or more of our significant customers fails to pay us for any reason, we could experience a material loss. In addition, in recent years, it has become more difficult to maintain and grow a customer base of creditworthy customers because a number of energy marketing and trading companies have discontinued their marketing and trading operations, which has significantly reduced the number of potential purchasers for our oil and natural gas production. As a result, we may experience a material loss as a result of the failure of our customers to pay us for prior purchases of our oil or natural gas.We may experience a decline in revenues if we lose one of our significant customers.For 2013, sales to BG Energy Merchants LLC accounted for approximately 48% of total consolidated revenues. BG Energy Merchants LLC is a subsidiary of BG Group. In addition, approximately 14% of our total consolidated revenues were to Chesapeake Energy Marketing Inc. Chesapeake Energy Marketing Inc. is a subsidiary of Chesapeake. The loss of any significant customer may cause a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our oil and natural gas.Competition in our industry is intense and we may be unable to compete in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and hiring experienced personnel.The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have greater financial and technical resources and a larger headcount than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit. The oil and natural gas industry has periodically experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and has caused significant expense/cost increases. We may experience difficulties in obtaining drilling rigs and other services in certain areas as well as an increase in the cost for these services and related material and equipment. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may again occur or how such shortages and price increases will affect our development and exploitation program. Competition has also been strong in hiring experienced personnel, particularly in petroleum engineering, geoscience, accounting and financial reporting, tax and land professions. In addition, competition is strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, oil and natural gas companies, and undeveloped leases and drilling rights. We are often outbid by competitors in our attempts to acquire properties or companies. All of these challenges could make it more difficult to execute our growth strategy.If third-party pipelines or other facilities interconnected to our gathering and transportation pipelines become unavailable to transport or process natural gas, our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected.We depend upon third party pipelines and other facilities to provide gathering and transportation. Much of the natural gas transported by our pipelines must be treated or processed before delivery into a pipeline for natural gas. If the processing and treating plants to which we deliver natural gas were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity or other causes, our customers would be unable to deliver natural gas to end markets. If any of such events occur, they could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.42Table of ContentsWe are currently involved in a search for a new chief executive officer and if this search is delayed or if we were to lose the services of other key personnel, our business could be negatively impacted.On November 20, 2013, Douglas H. Miller resigned from the positions of chief executive officer, chairman of the board of directors and as a director. Our board of directors appointed Jeffrey D. Benjamin to serve as non-executive chairman of the board of directors and initiated a search to identify a new chief executive officer. To the extent there is a delay in choosing a new chief executive officer, our business could be negatively impacted. In addition, our future success depends in part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. Our senior management team is critical to our management and they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.Our ability to use net operating loss carryovers to reduce future tax payments may be limited.Our net operating loss and other tax attribute carryovers ("NOLs") may be limited if we undergo an ownership change. Generally, an ownership change occurs if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership in us by more than 50 percentage points looking back over a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use our NOLs to reduce income taxes is limited to an annual amount, or the Section 382 limitation, equal to the fair market value of our common stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax-exempt interest rate, which is published monthly by the IRS. In the event of an ownership change, NOLs can be used to offset taxable income for years within a carryforward period subject to the Section 382 limitation. Any excess NOLs that exceed the Section 382 limitation in any year will continue to be allowed as carryforwards for the remainder of the carryforward period. Whether or not an ownership change occurs, the carryforward period for NOLs is 20 years from the year in which the losses giving rise to the NOLs were incurred. If the carryforward period for any NOL were to expire before that NOL had been fully utilized, the unused portion of that NOL would be lost. Our use of new NOLs arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected by the Section 382 limitation (unless there is another ownership change after the new NOLs arise).We exist in a litigious environment.Any constituent could bring suit regarding our existing or planned operations or allege a violation of an existing contract. Any such action could delay when planned operations can actually commence or could cause a halt to existing production until such alleged violations are resolved by the courts. Not only could we incur significant legal and support expenses in defending our rights, but halting existing production or delaying planned operations could impact our future operations and financial condition. In addition, we are defendants in numerous cases involving claims by landowners for surface or subsurface damages arising from our operations and for claims by unleased mineral owners and royalty owners for unpaid or underpaid revenues customary in our business. We incur costs in defending these claims and from time to time must pay damages or other amounts due. Such legal disputes can also distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities.Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.As an oil and natural gas production company, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities, essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.There are inherent limitations in all internal control over financial reporting, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.While we have taken actions designed to address compliance with the internal control, disclosure control and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC implementing these requirements, there are inherent limitations in our ability to control all circumstances. Our management, 43Table of Contentsincluding our chief financial officer and interim chief accounting officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of our company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.Certain of our undeveloped leasehold assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on the acreage.Leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. If our leases expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. While we seek to actively manage our leasehold inventory through drilling wells to hold the leasehold acreage that we believe is material to our operations, our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change.Potential physical effects of climate change could adversely affect our operations and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects. In an interpretative guidance on climate change disclosures, the SEC indicates that climate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including hurricanes and floods), sea levels, the arability of farmland, and water availability and quality. If such effects were to occur, our exploration and production operations, including the hydraulic fracturing of our wells, have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include disruption of our production activities, including, for example, damages to our facilities from powerful winds or increases in our costs of operation or reductions in the efficiency of our operations, as well as potentially increased costs for insurance coverage in the aftermath of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change. Risks relating to our indebtedness We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.As of January 31, 2014 we had approximately $1.5 billion of indebtedness, excluding our proportionate share of indebtedness for the EXCO/HGI Partnership, including $789.5 million of indebtedness subject to variable interest rates and $750.0 million of indebtedness under the 2018 Notes. Our total interest expense, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and our proportionate share of interest expense for the EXCO/HGI Partnership, on an annual basis based on currently available interest rates would be approximately $83.0 million and would change by approximately $5.4 million for every 1% change in interest rates.Our level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:•it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement or the indenture governing the 2018 Notes ("Indenture"), and the agreements governing our other indebtedness;•we may have difficulty borrowing money in the future for acquisitions (including obligations to acquire interests in wells pursuant to the KKR Participation Agreement), capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations;44Table of Contents•the amount of our interest expense may increase because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;•we will need to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money we have for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities;•we may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage;•we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices;•when oil and natural gas prices decline, our ability to maintain compliance with our financial covenants becomes more difficult and our borrowing base is subject to reductions, which may reduce or eliminate our ability to fund our operations; and•our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will be unable to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough money to service our debt, we may be required but unable to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all and may be required to surrender assets pursuant to the security provisions of the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. Further, failing to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the Indenture could result in an event of default, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may incur substantially more debt, which may intensify the risks described above, including our ability to service our indebtedness. Together with our subsidiaries, we may incur substantially more debt in the future in connection with our exploration, exploitation, development, acquisitions of undeveloped acreage and producing properties. The restrictions in our debt agreements on our incurrence of additional indebtedness are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. To the extent new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness levels, the risks described above could substantially increase. Significant additions of undeveloped acreage financed with debt may result in increased indebtedness without any corresponding increase in borrowing base, which could curtail drilling and development of this acreage or could cause us to not comply with our debt covenants.To service our indebtedness, fund our planned capital expenditure programs and fund acquisitions under the KKR Participation Agreement, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the 2018 Notes and the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and other resources in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas.Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including our 2018 Notes and the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, to fund planned capital expenditures or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations and capital expenditure programs, we may be forced to sell assets, issue additional equity or debt securities or restructure our debt. These remedies may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on and principal of our debt in the future, which could cause us to default on our obligations and could impair our liquidity.Our borrowing base under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement is subject to semi-annual redeterminations. If our borrowing base were to be reduced to a level which was less than the current borrowings, we would be required to reduce our borrowings to a level sufficient to cure any deficiency. We may be required to sell assets or seek alternative debt or equity which may not be available at commercially reasonable terms, if at all.45Table of ContentsIn addition, we conduct certain of our operations through our joint ventures and subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including the 2018 Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our joint ventures and subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the 2018 Notes or our other indebtedness, our joint ventures and subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the 2018 Notes or our other indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our joint ventures and subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each joint venture and subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our joint ventures and subsidiaries. While the Indenture and the agreements governing certain of our other existing indebtedness limit the ability of certain of our joint ventures and subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our joint ventures and subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the 2018 Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Restrictive debt covenants could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.The EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the Indenture contain a number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:•dispose of assets;•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain types of preferred stock;•pay dividends on our capital stock;•create liens on our assets;•enter into sale or leaseback transactions;•enter into specified investments or acquisitions;•repurchase, redeem or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt;•merge or consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries;•engage in specified transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates; or•pursue other corporate activities.Also, the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these ratios and financial condition tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and, as a result, we may be unable to meet these ratios and financial condition tests. These financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the Indenture. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition tests could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness. The consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX ratio, as defined in the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, is computed using a trailing 12 month computation. When oil and/or natural gas prices decline for an extended period of time, our ability to comply with this covenant becomes more difficult. Such a default, if not cured or waived, may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and could result in acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. An event of default under the Indenture would permit the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the agreement. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event that our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:•limited in how we conduct our business;•unable to raise additional debt or equity financing during general economic, business or industry downturns; or•unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.46Table of Contents The credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with our hedges and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. In addition, if any lender under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment under the credit agreement.Risks Relating to Our Common StockOur common stock price may fluctuate significantly.Our common stock trades on the NYSE but an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. The market price of shares of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:•announcements relating to our business or the business of our competitors;•changes in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of public market analysis;•actual or anticipated quarterly variations in our operating results;•conditions generally affecting the oil and natural gas industry;•the success of our operating strategy; and•the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies. Many of these factors are beyond our control and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common stock. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations.The equity trading markets may be volatile, which could result in losses for our shareholders.The equity trading markets may experience periods of volatility, which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of our common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition.Our articles of incorporation permits us to issue preferred stock that may restrict a takeover attempt that you may favor.Our articles of incorporation permit our board to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to establish by resolution one or more series of preferred stock and the powers, designations, preferences and participating, optional or other special rights of each series of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued on terms that are unfavorable to the holders of our common stock, including the grant of superior voting rights, the grant of preferences in favor of preferred shareholders in the payment of dividends and upon our liquidation and the designation of conversion rights that entitle holders of our preferred stock to convert their shares into shares of our common stock on terms that are dilutive to holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock in future offerings may make a takeover or change in control of us more difficult.We may reduce or discontinue paying our quarterly cash dividend if our board of directors determines that paying a dividend is no longer appropriate.We currently have a quarterly cash dividend program on shares of our common stock. Any future dividend payments will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. At any time, our board of directors may decide to reduce or discontinue paying our quarterly cash dividend. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. In addition, the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the Indenture restrict our ability to pay dividends.Oaktree Capital Management, WL Ross & Co. LLC and/or their respective affiliates have significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval because of their ownership of our common stock.47Table of ContentsAs of January 17, 2014, Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”), and WL Ross & Co. LLC (“WL Ross”), directly or through certain affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 16.6% and 18.7%, respectively, of our outstanding shares of common stock. The beneficial ownership of Oaktree and WL Ross and/or their affiliates provides them with significant influence regarding matters submitted for shareholder approval, including proposals regarding: •any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets;•the election of members of our board of directors; and•any amendment to our articles of incorporation.The current or increased ownership position of Oaktree, WL Ross and/or their respective affiliates could delay, deter or prevent a change of control or adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. The interests of Oaktree, WL Ross, and/or their respective affiliates may significantly differ from the interests of our other shareholders and they may vote the shares of common stock they beneficially own in ways with which our other shareholders disagree.Item 1B.
