Risk factors Corus is subject to various changing competitive and economic conditions that affect the market for steel and aluminium. The following is a description of factors that may affect Corus business, results of operations and share price: Form 20-F 2004 1 Return to contents page Risks relating to the Groups business Corus has incurred operating losses in previous years and may do so again. Although Corus had an operating profit of £582 million for the year ended January 1, 2005, it incurred an operating loss of £208 million in the previous year. The Group returned to profit in 2004 as a result of strong global demand for steel products and higher steel prices, which fully offset substantial increases in raw material costs. The Group also benefited from the Restoring Success programme (see below) launched in 2003 to improve performance across all its businesses and to close the performance gap between Corus and its European competitors. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that these economic conditions will persist, that Corus initiatives will continue to be successful or that Corus will maintain positive operating income or cash flows from operations in the future. Corus Restoring Success programme may not achieve its goals or may cost more than anticipated, which could have a material adverse effect on Corus financial condition. In response to the declining steel demand from Corus UK customer base, resulting from the long-term erosion of the UK manufacturing industry, and coupled with the lack of competitiveness in export markets related in part to the strength of sterling in 2001, Corus initiated a restructuring programme in 2001. In April 2003 Corus Board announced additional restructuring initiatives to concentrate its steelmaking in the UK at three sites. The details of the Restoring Success programme and its objectives are provided on pages 11 to 13 under Item 4. Whilst this programme is broadly progressing to plan, there can be no assurance that the total capital expenditure and restructuring costs will not exceed present expectations. Additionally, Corus restructuring plans are subject to operational risks and benefits of the plan will depend in part on the strength of sterling against the euro. Thus, there can be no guarantee that Corus restructuring plans will achieve their intended goals. Whilst Corus believes the Restoring Success programme is necessary in order to combat the Groups past operating losses and to improve the Groups financial performance, these significant changes are subject to risks and uncertainties and the scope of change currently envisioned by Corus may prove difficult to realise. In addition, management has made several key assumptions in relation to its Restoring Success programme, including specific assumptions tied to each aspect of the initiatives and general assumptions relating to exchange rates and market prices for steel and raw materials. Corus has also assumed that it will be able to dedicate significant management resources from both senior management and at business units, whilst mitigating disruption to existing plant performance as these initiatives continue. These assumptions have remained valid to the end of 2004 but, nevertheless, if they are not realised in the future, Corus may be unable to achieve all of the anticipated benefits of its Restoring Success programme or the cost of achieving these benefits may be higher than expected. Corus operating results are strongly affected by movements in exchange rates, particularly between sterling and the euro and between sterling and the US dollar. Corus derives most of its turnover and incurs much of its costs in the EU. Within the EU, Corus has substantial assets and sales in the UK, which is not a member of the eurozone. Whereas the majority of the costs of Corus in the UK are not affected by the sterling to euro exchange rate, steel prices in Europe, including the UK, in the medium and long term are largely set in euros. Therefore, fluctuations in the sterling to euro exchange rate impact heavily on Corus revenue in the UK. In 2004, £7.6 billion or 81% of the Groups total turnover was derived from Europe, the most important market for the Group. Turnover in other export markets and Corus major supplies purchases, including iron ore and coal, are mainly denominated in US dollars. Corus aluminium sales, which are based on London Metal Exchange (LME) prices, are also quoted in US dollars. As a result, Corus revenues are impacted by fluctuations in the US dollar to sterling and the US dollar to euro exchange rates. In recent years, sterling has appreciated significantly in relation to the US dollar and may continue to do so in the future. Volatility in exchange rates affects the Groups results from operations in a number of ways. It impacts the Groups revenues from export markets, affects the strength of Corus competitors and their ability to penetrate the UK steel market, and exposes Corus UK customers to similar pressures, which may result in a reduction in demand for steel in the UK. 2 Form 20-F 2004 Return to contents page Certain business decisions concerning Corus business require approval by the Corus Nederland Supervisory Board, a body whose composition is not wholly within the control of Corus, and that has previously withheld its approval of a key strategy decision of Corus Group. Corus Nederland, whose assets include the Groups Dutch business and its aluminium operations, is subject to the mitigated structure regime under the provisions of the Dutch Civil Code as amended on October 1, 2004. Pursuant to this regime, Corus Nederland has established a Management Board and a Supervisory Board. The members of the Management Board are appointed and dismissed by the general meeting of shareholders and the composition of this Board is therefore effectively controlled by Corus. The members of the Supervisory Board were appointed and dismissed by the members of the Supervisory Board itself. The Supervisory Board owes duties to constituencies beyond Corus Group plc and its shareholders, which includes employees, bondholders and trade creditors of Corus Nederland and its subsidiaries. A number of important decisions by the Corus Nederland Management Board involving the businesses held by Corus Nederland are subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board. The decisions that are subject to Supervisory Board approval include: the entering into and termination of long-term or material collaborative arrangements between Corus Nederland and third parties; proposals by the Management Board for the amendment of the Corus Nederland articles of association (though this would not preclude the general meeting of shareholders resolving on such amendment without a Corus Nederland Management Board proposal); the issue of shares and debentures; termination of the employment of a material number of Corus Nederland employees; far-reaching changes to the employment conditions of a material number of Corus Nederland employees; and significant investments, disposals and acquisitions. In addition, the articles of association of Corus Nederland provide that the Supervisory Board may extend the range of decisions that are subject to its approval. In March 2003, the Supervisory Board withheld its approval from the Management Boards decision, implementing the Group strategy to sell the aluminium businesses held by Corus Nederland to Pechiney. If Corus is not able to obtain the approval of the Supervisory Board for the decisions affecting the businesses held by Corus Nederland or the co-operation of the Supervisory Board on other matters, this could preclude Corus Group from realising its strategy, developing its business, realising the payment of dividends and the making of intra-group loans by Corus Nederland and utilising cash resources for the benefit of the Corus Group. On October 1, 2004, certain amendments to Dutch company law came into force. Under the new law, the powers of shareholders in companies subject to the mitigated structure regime were enhanced and the general meeting of shareholders will now appoint the members of the Supervisory Board, subject to the following procedure. On the basis of a profile drawn up by the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board is entitled to make nominations for the appointment of supervisory directors. A nomination can be overturned by the general meeting. If the general meeting has overturned a nomination, the Supervisory Board will be entitled to make a new nomination. The works council will have an enhanced right of recommendation in respect of one third of the number of supervisory directors. The general meeting of shareholders will also have the power to effectively dismiss the entire Supervisory Board. In the case where the entire Supervisory Board is dismissed, the Management Board of the company must immediately request the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeals to appoint one or more temporary supervisory directors, who must then see to it that a new Supervisory Board be appointed. Corus Nederland has established a Central Works Council. Under the provisions of the Dutch Works Council Act (WCA) the Central Works Council has the right to give advice on a number of proposed decisions by the Management Board of Corus Nederland, including decisions regarding: the transfer of control of the enterprise or any part thereof; the establishment, take-over or relinquishing of control of another enterprise; the termination of the activities of an enterprise or a substantial part thereof; expansion or other change in the activities of the enterprise; a substantial change in the organisation of the enterprise or in the allocation of the authority within the enterprise; and the appointment of an outside expert to provide advice on any of these matters. In addition, the Central Works Council has the right to advise on any proposed decision regarding a transfer of control of Corus Nederland. The WCA allows the Central Works Council to initiate litigation before the Enterprise Chamber of Form 20-F 2004 3 Return to contents page the Amsterdam Court of Appeals if no advice is sought or if the Management Board intends to proceed with implementing a decision despite receiving negative advice from, or deviating from conditions set by, the Central Works Council. Corus has a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, which could limit its operating flexibility and otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. As of January 1, 2005, Corus had total borrowings of £1,454 million. Corus outstanding or future indebtedness and related covenants could limit its operating flexibility and could otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. This level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following: • it may become difficult for Corus to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditure, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes in the future; • a substantial portion of Corus cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to Corus for other purposes; • it may limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants applicable to Corus debt, Corus ability to borrow additional funds even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity; • some of Corus borrowings are, and are expected to be, at variable rates of interest (including borrowings under its primary bank credit facility in the future), which exposes Corus to the risk of increased interest rates; • Corus flexibility to adjust to changing economic or market conditions may be constrained and its ability to withstand competitive pressures may be reduced, making Corus more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions; and • it may place Corus at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors, if they have lower levels of debt and, as a consequence, have greater operating and financial flexibility than Corus. Corus interest costs for its indebtedness are linked to its credit rating. Should Corus credit rating be downgraded, Corus interest costs may increase. Additionally, such an event may make it more difficult for Corus to obtain additional financing. The addition of further debt to current levels could exacerbate the leverage-related risks described above. Corus primary bank credit facility has a final maturity date of June 30, 2006 (refer to Significant changes under Item 8). A portion of Corus outstanding indebtedness, including its convertible bonds, will reach maturity between 2006 and 2008, which may have an effect on Corus financial position and results of operations. If Corus cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service requirements and its other obligations, Corus may be forced to reduce or delay scheduled expansion and capital expenditure (particularly with regard to the Restoring Success programme), sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of its debt. Corus ability to comply with the covenants under its senior credit facility will depend on achieving planned financial results. On July 31, 2003, Corus entered into a secured senior credit facility with an initial principal amount of €1,200 million. This facility was replaced in February 2005 by a new €800 million banking facility with a reduced security package (refer to Significant changes under Item 8). Nevertheless, under this new facility, Corus must comply with certain financial covenants. Several of these required measures become more stringent over time. Corus is in compliance with these covenants and expects to remain in compliance. However, compliance with these covenants can be adversely affected if Corus is unable to achieve its planned financial results that, in turn, can be affected by unforeseen events and by events and circumstances outside of Corus control. Although Corus sensitivity to these covenants has diminished and is expected to continue to do so as the results of its Restoring Success programme take further effect, there is no assurance that Corus will remain in compliance with these covenants in the future. In the event that Corus breaches one of these covenants and is unable to obtain a waiver 4 Form 20-F 2004 Return to contents page from the lenders, it will be in default under the facility and, consequently, other indebtedness. Upon a default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the facility, together with accrued interest, due and payable and/or enforce on the collateral securing the facility. Corus operations may be adversely affected by business interruptions and property damage. Corus operations may be adversely affected by abnormal unplanned events such as explosions, fires and other industrial accidents, transportation interruptions and inclement weather. For example, on September 29, 2003, a fire at Scunthorpe works ceased steelmaking there temporarily. The cost of the damage resulting from the fire and other related operating costs and lost contribution, which were not covered by third party insurance, was approximately £20 million. As part of its risk management, Corus maintains insurance cover through a combination of self funding and policies purchased from third party insurers. To the extent one or more events occur that are not covered by insurance, Corus operating results and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. Corus future pension expenses, based on actuarial assumptions, may prove more costly than currently anticipated and the market value of Corus pension assets could decline. Corus provides retirement benefits for substantially all of its employees under several benefit and contribution plans. Corus contributes to these defined benefit plans the amount that is required by governing legislation in the countries in which it operates. Pension contributions are calculated by independent actuaries using various assumptions about future events. The actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual future results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may impact Corus recorded net pension expense and liability, as well as future funding requirements. As at January 1, 2005, under FRS 17, the market value of Corus pension assets was £12.1 billion and its pension liabilities were assessed at £12.2 billion. If there is a significant adverse change in the mark et value of Corus pension assets, Corus may need to increase its pension contributions, which could have an adverse impact on Corus financial results. The application of international accounting standards may lead to material differences in the results of operation and/or the financial position of the Group in comparison with existing accounting policies applied. Corus will start to prepare its consolidated accounts under International Accounting Standards (IASs) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) from January 1, 2005 along with some 7,000 other companies with shares and debt listed within the EU. From 2003 and throughout 2004, Corus has undertaken a project to implement the necessary accounting system and process changes to comply with these new standards. Corus continues to assess the latest changes to international accounting standards and interpretations of those standards, in particular IFRIC 3 (proposing to treat emission rights as intangible assets) and IFRIC 4 (providing further guidance on those agreements to be treated as leases). Until this assessment and the planned external review of the restatement of 2004 have been completed, Corus is not yet able to disclose the financial impact of the application of IASs and IFRSs. However, as w ell as changes in the presentation and format of primary statements and notes to the accounts, the most significant areas of change will be in the treatment of the following: • Employee benefits, in particular pension costs and balances that will no longer reflect the smoothing effect of SSAP 24. • Convertible debt, which will have to be disclosed and accounted for as separate debt and equity elements. • Goodwill, which is no longer amortised and instead is assessed for impairment on an annual basis. • Share based remuneration, where costs must be recognised on a fair value basis and there is no exemption for UK Inland Revenue approved or similar sharesave schemes. • Development and software costs, where there is a greater emphasis to capitalise such items. Form 20-F 2004 5 Return to contents page • Deferred tax balances, which can no longer be discounted and are recognised on the basis of temporary differences rather than timing differences. • Derivative financial instruments, which must be carried in the balance sheet at their fair value. Risks relating to the steel and aluminium industries Corus results of operations could be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the steel industry and the industries Corus serves. The steel and aluminium industries are highly cyclical, sensitive to general economic conditions and dependent on the condition of certain other industries. Corus steel business supports cyclical industries such as the automotive, appliance, construction and energy industries. The demand for steel products is generally affected by macroeconomic fluctuations in Europe and the global markets in which steel companies sell their products. As a result, the prices of steel and steel products may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond Corus control. Aluminium end use markets, including the transport (especially automotive and aerospace) and construction sectors, are also cyclical. When downturns occur in these sectors, Corus may experience decreased demand for its products, which may have a material adverse effect on its financial results. The volatility and the length and nature of business cycles affecting the steel industry have become increasingly unpredictable, and the recurrence of another major downturn in the industry may have a material adverse impact on Corus business, operations, profits and financial condition. A change in the demand for steel in China could have a significant impact on the global steel market. China is currently increasing steel producing capacity by millions of tonnes every year and importing large volumes of finished steel and raw materials. Chinas imports of raw materials are driving up prices globally, particularly for iron ore, metallurgical coal and scrap. In addition, Chinese demand for freight to import raw materials and export finished products is increasing ocean freight rates to unprecedented levels. Corus has already experienced the impact of higher raw material prices and freight costs, which may further increase. Although Chinas demand for imports of finished steel and raw materials may continue to grow in the near future, this growth may decline as the Chinese supply of steel is brought into balance with the demand. As a result, countries presently exporting large volumes to China would likely search for alternative markets. Such behaviour could impact the markets that Corus sells into, resulting in Corus losing sales volume, or having to reduce steel prices, which may have a material adverse impact on Corus revenues and financial condition. Corus profitability may be affected by changes in the cost and availability of raw materials and Corus may not be able to recover increased raw material costs in higher selling prices. The prices of many of the raw materials Corus uses depend on world-wide supply and demand relationships, and are therefore subject to fluctuation. The principal raw materials used by Corus are iron ore and metallurgical coal, purchased on international markets, and scrap. Corus typically enters into long term supply contracts with certain of its raw material vendors. The pricing terms of these contracts are determined on an annual basis and thus do not protect Corus from significant price increases. There is a potential time lag between changes in prices under Corus purchase contracts with its vendors and the time when Corus can implement a corresponding price change under its sales contracts with its customers. Prices for the raw materials that Corus requires may continue to increase and, if they do, Corus may not be able to pass on the entire cost of such increases to its customers or to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs through productivity improvements, which may cause its profitability to decline. When the global demand for raw materials is strong, the terms of supply purchase contracts may be disadvantageous to Corus. Thus, shortages of, or price increases for, supplies could have a material adverse effect on Corus ability to sell certain of its products in a cost-effective manner and sell such products profitably. 6 Form 20-F 2004 Return to contents page Corus business is greatly affected by price volatility, which is largely the result of high fixed costs characteristic of the steel industry. The production of steel is capital intensive, with a high proportion of fixed to total costs. Consequently, steel producers seek to maintain high capacity utilisation. If capacity exceeds demand, there is a tendency for prices to fall sharply as supply is largely maintained. Conversely, expansion of capacity requires long lead times so that, if demand grows strongly, prices increase rapidly, as unutilised capacity cannot be brought on line as quickly. The result is substantial price volatility. While Corus has taken steps to reduce operating costs, including reducing steel production capacity, Corus may be negatively affected by significant price volatility, particularly in the event of excess production capacity in the global steel market, and incur operating losses as a result. Strong competition may continue to exert downward pressure on Corus pricing. Corus experiences intense competition within the steel and aluminium industries at both a regional and global level. International trade is a substantial component of Corus business, with the result that changes in market conditions in one region are rapidly transmitted to other regions. The competitive arena encompasses quality, customer service, delivery performance, product development and price. Although as a technologically advanced materials producer, Corus attempts to differentiate its products by emphasising non-price competitive advantages, Corus is still subject to the effect of strong price competition from commodity producers in developing countries that compete in the markets in which Corus seeks to sell its products (see section Competition  steel on pages 20 and 21 under Item 4). High energy costs adversely impact Corus results of operations. Both steel and aluminium production processes are energy intensive. Corus operations consume large amounts of energy, in particular natural gas and electricity. A significant increase in energy prices could have an adverse impact on Corus financial results. For example, at normal annual consumption levels, every £0.001 per kilowatt-hour rise in electricity costs would increase Corus operating costs by approximately £10 million, while a £0.01 per therm rise in natural gas prices would increase Corus operating costs by approximately £5 million. In addition, Corus aluminium smelters generally require an uninterrupted supply of intense electrical energy, and any significant interruption may have a technical, commercial and financial impact on the facility concerned. The UK, Dutch and German governments have imposed general energy taxes on industry. Corus has endeavoured to minimise the cost impact of these taxes through a series of negotiated agreements. From April 2001, the UK Government imposed a tax on the business use of energy. A negotiated agreement was signed with the UK Government to allow Corus to take an 80% reduction in the amount of such tax provided certain energy targets are met. Corus has met its energy efficiency target for 2004 and will receive this reduction for 2005 and 2006. The reduction is worth approximately £28 million per annum. Health, safety and environmental matters, including compliance with environmental laws and remediation of contamination, could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs. Corus businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to health, safety and the environment in the countries in which Corus operates. These laws and regulations concern air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste material handling and disposal, worker health and safety, and the investigation and remediation of contamination. The risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to these laws and regulations are an inherent part of the Groups business, and future conditions and contamination may develop, arise or be discovered that create substantial environmental compliance or remediation liabilities and costs. Although Corus believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental, health and safety regulations, violations of such laws or regulations can lead to fines and penalties. In addition, risks of substantial costs and liabilities, including for the investigation and remediation of past or present contamination, at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by Corus, or at which wastes have been disposed, are inherent in Corus operations, and there can be no assurance that substantial costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future. Form 20-F 2004 7 Return to contents page Other developments, such as increased requirements of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, increasingly strict enforcement thereof by governmental authorities, and claims for damages to property or injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health or safety impacts of Corus operations or past contamination, could prevent or restrict some of Corus operations, require the expenditure of significant funds to bring Corus into compliance, involve the imposition of clean up requirements and give rise to civil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that any such legislation, regulation, enforcement or private claim will not have a material adverse effect on Corus business, financial condition or results of operations. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) was adopted on July 22, 2003 and came into force on January 1, 2005. Participation is mandatory for defined sectors including combustion plant, iron and steel production, sinter plants, coke ovens and lime production. Primary and secondary aluminium production are not included. Costs may be incurred if the issued allowances for CO2 are insufficient to meet the actual emissions and the shortfall of emissions have to be met by purchases on the EU ETS market. The failure to surrender enough CO2 credits at the end of each year will result in a fine of €40 per tonne of CO2 for the first phase 2005 to 2 007. In addition, the shortfall in CO2 has also to be purchased on the ETS market. With regard to its emissions allowances in the Netherlands, Corus has lodged an appeal with the Dutch Council of State as part of administrative proceedings in which Corus has objected to the method used for allocation of emissions allowances under the Dutch National Allocation Plan (see also Legal proceedings under Item 8). Corus is currently addressing contamination at its closed facilities, and may be required to initiate environmental investigation and remediation projects at both former and current operating locations. In addition to potential clean up liability, Corus may become subject to monetary fines and penalties for violation of applicable laws, regulations or administrative orders. Corus may be subject to liability related to the use of hazardous substances in production. Corus uses a variety of hazardous materials, gases and chemicals in its manufacturing activities. The management, use and disposal of these substances are regulated by laws and regulations that have not, to date, resulted in material costs to Corus. There can be no assurance that more onerous laws will not be adopted in the future, resulting in material costs or liabilities to Corus. In the event that any of these substances, proves to be toxic or accidents involving these substances occur, Corus may be liable for increased costs for health-related claims or removal or treatment of such substances. Actions taken by governments of other major steel importing countries can result in disruption to Corus business and affect steel prices globally as trade flows adjust. The large trade flows and, in particular, large swings in trade, which can result from changing market conditions, can lead to trade remedy actions to protect domestic industries. Exports by Corus to the United States have been subject to such trade remedies, including Safeguard measures imposed by the US under Section 201 of the US Trade Act of 1974 on imports of a number of steel products such as flat rolled steel, plates, and wire rod. Although these Safeguard measures were terminated in December 2003, there can be no assurance that future similar trade remedy measures instituted by the US or other governments will not have a significant impact on Corus export sales or that Corus will be able to mitigate the impact of such measures. 8 Form 20-F 2004 Return to contents page
