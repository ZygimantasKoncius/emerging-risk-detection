Item 1A. Risk Factors Affecting Operating ResultsAdverse market conditions in the electronics industry could reduce our future sales and earnings per share. We cannot accurately predict future levels of demand for our customers' electronics products. Consequently, our past operating results, earnings and cash flows may not be indicative of our future operating results, earnings and cash flows. In 2008, 2009 and then again during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, adverse worldwide economic conditions led to challenging conditions in the electronics industry. A number of factors, including lower asset values, price instability, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, high unemployment and concerns about the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, and sovereign nations slowed global economic growth and resulted in recessions in many countries, including in the United States, Europe and certain countries in Asia. The conditions resulted in our customers delaying purchases or placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously experienced or anticipated. These conditions have persisted and, in some cases, worsened, increasing the risk of a renewed worldwide economic downturn. Such conditions could cause a number of adverse conditions, including the reduction or delay in orders from our customers or potential customers, the insolvency of key suppliers, which could result in production delays, shorter payment terms from suppliers due to reduced availability of credit default insurance in the market, the inability of customers to obtain credit needed to purchase products from us, and the insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables, increase our need for cash, and decrease our net revenue and profitability.We may experience component shortages or price increases, which could cause us to delay shipments to customers and reduce our sales and net income; the natural disasters in Japan and Thailand could also reduce our sales and profitability. We are dependent on certain suppliers, including limited and sole source suppliers, to provide key components we incorporate into our products. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, delays in component deliveries, which in turn could cause delays in product shipments to customers, result in reduced revenue from and have an adverse effect on our relationship with the affected customer, and our reputation generally as a reliable service provider. In addition, component shortages, whether anticipated or not, can increase our cost of goods sold and therefore decrease our gross margin since we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply and redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate substitute components. Additionally, we may purchase components in advance of our requirements for those components as a result of a threatened or anticipated shortage. In this event, we may incur additional inventory carrying costs and have a heightened risk of exposure to inventory obsolescence, the cost of either of which may not be recoverable from our customers. Such costs would reduce our margins and net income. Finally, if key components become scarce, we may be required to look to second tier vendors or to procure components through brokers. Such components may be of lesser quality than those otherwise available and could cause us to incur costs to qualify such components or to replace them if they prove to be defective. The continuing economic effects of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan may result in our customers based in Japan ordering reduced amounts of product from us resulting from interruptions in their own businesses and diminished demand from Japanese consumers. In addition, recent floods in Thailand may also adversely impact our ability to source components in that country. Although these conditions have not, to date, significantly impacted our financial results, a slow-down in the pace of recovery in Japan or a worsening of conditions in Thailand could adversely impact our business in the future by preventing us from building products that require components sourced in those countries or increasing our expenses as we are forced to find alternative sources of supply. Should such reduction of demand and tightening supply conditions arise and then continue over an extended period of time, our revenue, margins and net income could be reduced, perhaps significantly. Our customers could experience credit problems, which would reduce our future revenues and net income.Many of the industries to which we provide products have previously experienced significant financial difficulty, with some of the participants filing for bankruptcy. Such financial difficulty, if experienced by one or more of our customers, may negatively affect our business due to the decreased demand from these financially distressed customers, the lengthening of customer payment terms, the potential inability of these companies to make full payment on amounts owed to us, or any of these factors. Customer bankruptcies also entail the risk of potential recovery by the bankruptcy estate of amounts previously paid to us that are deemed a preference under bankruptcy laws. We do not carry insurance against the risk of customer default on their payment obligations to us.We seek to mitigate the impact of collection problems with our customers on our financial results by evaluating their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis and by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts that is assessed for adequacy 18Table of Contentsquarterly. Should customer defaults increase substantially or exceed the level of our allowance, our revenue, net income and cash position would be reduced, perhaps significantly. Our cash generated from operations is variable, which can adversely affect our ability to plan and invest in the business. Cash generated from operations is highly variable. For example, during fiscal 2010, we used $78 million of cash in operating activities and in fiscal 2011, we generated $235 million in cash from operating activities. Our cash generated by or used in operations is impacted by a number of variables, including customer and supplier payment terms, timeliness of customer payments to us and the extent to which we need to increase inventories in response to customer forecasts. Our ability to make capital expenditures and pay down debt or whether we need to utilize our borrowing facilities depends in large part on our ability to generate cash from operations. To the extent our cash from operations fluctuates significantly in the future, our ability to make such investments and payments could be adversely impacted, which could also adversely impact our ability to expand our business and reduce our indebtedness. Our strategy to pursue higher margin business depends in part on the success of our components and optical businesses, which if not successful, could cause our future gross margins and operating results to be lower. Our components business, which includes printed circuit boards, mechanical systems, cable manufacturing and our optical business, are a key part of our strategy to grow our future margins and profitability by expanding our vertical integration capabilities. In order to grow this portion of our business profitably, we must continue to make substantial investments in the development of our components capabilities, research and development activities, test and tooling equipment and skilled personnel. Given the relatively higher fixed cost structure of this business, our success is greatly dependent upon obtaining sufficient orders for our components manufacturing services which is difficult to predict. For example, in the second quarter of 2011, a sudden drop in optical product orders contributed to a decrease in our revenue and gross margin compared to analyst expectations. The success of our components and optical businesses also depends on our ability to achieve commercially viable production yields and to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the specifications and quality standards required by customers. In particular, our customers require that all new components used in their products be qualified in advance which can be costly both in terms of time and cost and may not result in the customers' acceptance of our components. Any of these factors could cause our components and optical revenue or margins to be less than expected, which would have an overall adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. Adverse changes in the key end markets we target could harm our business by reducing our sales.We provide EMS services to companies that sell products in the communications, industrial, defense, medical, enterprise computing and storage and multimedia markets. Adverse changes in any of these markets could reduce demand for our customers' products and make these customers more sensitive to the cost of our EMS services, either of which could reduce our sales, gross margins and net income. Factors affecting any of our customers' industries in general, or our customers in particular, have led to reductions in net sales in certain end markets, and such factors could seriously harm our business in the future. These factors include: •short product life cycles of our customers' products leading to continuing new requirements and specifications and product obsolescence , either of which could cause us to lose business;•failure of our customers' products to gain widespread commercial acceptance which could decrease the volume of orders customers place with us; and •recessionary periods in our customers' markets which decrease orders from affected customers. In addition, in the case of our defense business, U.S. government budgetary conditions or withdrawal from Iraq or Afghanistan could result in a decrease in defense spending, which in turn could cause a reduction in orders placed by the government or defense contractors for products manufactured by our defense and aerospace (DAS) division. Since such products carry higher margins than many of our other products and services, such a decrease would contribute disproportionately to a reduction in our gross margin and profitability. An unexpected decline in DAS orders during the second quarter of 2011 contributed to our financial results not meeting analyst expectations for such quarter. Although it appears that revenue levels for our defense and aerospace division have stabilized, there can be no assurance that we will not experience declines in demand in the future. We may be unable to obtain sufficient financing to reduce our debt levels or maintain or expand our operations, which may cause our stock price to fall and reduce the business our customers and vendors do with us. Our liquidity needs are largely dependent on changes in working capital, including inventory requirements, the extension 19Table of Contentsof trade credit by our suppliers, the degree of alignment of payment terms from our suppliers to payment terms granted to our customers, investments in facilities and equipment, acquisitions, repayments of obligations under outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of our outstanding debt. In connection with the management of our liquidity needs, we entered into a five-year $135 million asset-backed credit facility in November 2008, which we later increased to $235 million, under which we could borrow $141.2 million as of October 1, 2011. We also have $85 million in foreign short-term financing facilities under which $24.8 million remained available to be borrowed as of October 1, 2011. Our asset-backed credit facility expires in November 2013 and our next long-term debt maturity is in 2014. In the event we need additional capital, whether for working capital, debt repayment or otherwise, there can be no assurance that debt or equity capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. New financing could result in us issuing additional equity securities, which could cause dilution to existing stockholders. If additional or continued financing, including the continued extension of trade credit by our suppliers, is not available when required, our ability to repay, reduce or refinance our debt, maintain or increase our rates of production and expand our manufacturing capacity, as well as our overall liquidity, will be harmed, which could cause our stock price to fall and reduce our customers' and vendors' willingness to do business with us. Our credit arrangements contain covenants which may adversely impact our business and the failure to comply with such covenants could cause our outstanding debt to become immediately payable. Our debt agreements do not contain financial covenants currently applicable to us, but do include a number of negative covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, making investments and other restricted payments, acquiring new businesses, paying dividends and redeeming or repurchasing capital stock and debt, subject to certain exceptions. These covenants could constrain our ability to grow our business through acquisition or engage in other transactions which the covenants would otherwise restrict, including refinancing our existing debt. In addition, such agreements include affirmative covenants requiring, among other things, that we file quarterly and annual financial statements with the SEC, comply with all laws, pay all taxes and maintain casualty insurance. If we are not able to comply with all of these covenants, for any reason, some or all of our outstanding debt as well as all amounts payable under our interest rate swaps on such debt, if any, could become immediately due and payable and the incurrence of additional debt under our asset-backed credit facility would not be allowed. Our early redemptions of debt have reduced our working capital and liquidity; debt refinancing can entail higher interest expense, which would lower our net income; interest payments on variable rate debt can increase, which would lower our net income. During 2010 and 2011, we redeemed $195.7 million and net $80 million of our long-term debt, respectively. Although redemptions of debt improve our operating results by reducing our interest expense, these redemptions have reduced our liquidity. If we should repurchase or redeem additional debt or equity, our working capital and liquidity would be further reduced. In addition, should we undertake to refinance any of our outstanding long-term debt, the next maturity of which is 2014, there can be no assurance that the terms of such refinancing, particularly the interest rate, would be favorable to us. Should we be forced to replace lower interest rate debt with higher interest rate debt, our net income would be reduced. In addition, an aggregate of $500 million of our long-term debt and $60.2 million in short-term borrowings bear interest at a variable rate based upon LIBOR. Interest rates, including LIBOR, can rise due to a variety of factors, including governmental debt levels, ratings downgrade of U.S. or other sovereign debt, the pace of economic growth and central bank actions. Should LIBOR increase substantially in the future for any reason, our interest payments on our variable interest rate debt would also increase, lowering our net income. We are subject to intense competition in the EMS industry which could cause us to lose sales and therefore hurt our financial performance. The EMS industry is highly competitive and the industry has been experiencing a surplus of manufacturing capacity, particularly in light of the slowdowns in the U.S. and certain international economies. Our competitors include major global EMS providers such as Celestica, Inc., Flextronics International Ltd., Hon Hai (Foxconn) and Jabil Circuit, Inc., as well as other EMS companies that have a regional, product, service or industry specific focus. Some of those companies have greater manufacturing and financial resources than we do. We also face competition from current and potential OEM customers who may elect to manufacture their own products internally rather than outsourcing to EMS providers. We may not be able to offer prices as low as some of our competitors because those competitors may have lower operating costs as a result of their geographic location, greater economies of scale or the services they provide or because these competitors are willing to provide EMS services at prices we are unable or unwilling to offer. There can be no assurance that we will not lose business in the future in response to such competitive pricing or other inducements which may be offered by our competitors, which would decrease our sales and net income.20Table of ContentsIf demand for our higher-end, higher margin manufacturing services does not increase, our future gross margins and operating results may be lower than expected. We typically earn lower gross margins when we provide less complex EMS services. We experience continued pressure from OEMs to reduce prices, and competition remains intense. Pricing pressure is typically more intense for less complex, lower margin EMS services. This price competition has affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our gross margins. If demand for our higher-end, higher margin manufacturing services does not increase in the future, our gross margins and operating results in future periods may be lower than expected. Our operating results are subject to significant uncertainties, which make predictability of our future sales and net income difficult. Our operating results are subject to significant uncertainties, including: •conditions in the economy as a whole and in the electronics industry;•fluctuations in components prices and component shortages caused by high demand, natural disaster or otherwise, which could cause us to be unable to meet customer delivery schedules, increase our costs and potentially decrease our profitability;•timing of new product development by our customers which creates demand for our services;•levels of demand in the end markets served by our customers;•our ability to replace declining sales from end of life programs with new business wins;•timing of orders from customers and the accuracy of their forecasts;•inventory levels of customers, which if high relative to their normal sales volume, could cause them to reduce their orders to us;•timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales, customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor;•increased labor costs in the regions in which we operate;•mix of products ordered by and shipped to major customers, as high volume and low complexity manufacturing services typically have lower gross margins than more complex and lower volume services;•degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity;•our ability to maintain desired plant operating efficiencies, including achieving acceptable yields, effectively planning production and managing our inventory and fixed assets to avoid high carrying costs and excess working capital;•our ability to effectively plan production and manage our inventory and fixed assets;•customer insolvencies resulting in bad debt or inventory exposures that are in excess of our reserves;•our ability to efficiently move manufacturing activities to lower cost regions without adversely affecting customer relationships while controlling costs related to the closure of facilities and employee severance;•pricing and other competitive pressures;•fluctuations in the values of our assets, including real property and assets held for sale, which could result in charges to income;•volatility of foreign currency exchange rates;•changes in our tax provision due to our estimates of pre-tax income in the jurisdictions in which we operate; and•political and economic developments in countries in which we have operations. A portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders, which are difficult to predict. If we do not receive anticipated orders as expected, our profitability will decline. Moreover, our ability to reduce our costs as a result of current or future restructuring efforts may be limited because consolidation of operations can be a costly and lengthy process to complete.We generally do not obtain long-term volume purchase commitments from customers and, therefore, cancellations, reductions in production quantities and delays in production by our customers could reduce our sales and net income.We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers and our bookings may generally be cancelled prior to the scheduled shipment date. Customers may cancel their orders, reduce production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons, including significant decreases in demand for their products and services. Although the customer is generally liable for finished goods and work-in-process at the time of cancellation, we may be unable or, for other business reasons, choose not to enforce our contractual rights. Cancellations, reductions or delays of orders by customers would: 21Table of Contents •reduce our sales and net income by decreasing the volumes of products that we manufacture for our customers;•delay or eliminate recovery of our expenditures for inventory purchased in preparation for customer orders; and•lower our asset utilization, which would result in lower gross margins and lower net income. In addition, customers sometimes require that we transfer the manufacturing of their products from one facility to another to achieve cost reductions and other objectives. These transfers have resulted in increased costs to us due to facility downtime or less than optimal utilization of our manufacturing capacity. These transfers also have required us to close or reduce operations at certain facilities, particularly those in high cost locations such as the United States, Canada and Western Europe, and as a result we have incurred significant costs for the closure of facilities, employee severance and related matters. We also have encountered occasional delays and complications related to the transition of manufacturing programs to new locations. We may be required to relocate our manufacturing operations in the future and, accordingly, we may incur additional costs that decrease our net income. Commodity price fluctuations may negatively impact our results of operations.Our components are manufactured using a number of commodities, including gold, copper and other metals, as well as petroleum, that are subject to frequent and unpredictable changes in price due to worldwide demand, investor interest and economic conditions. We do not hedge against the risk of these fluctuations, but rather attempt to adjust our product pricing to reflect such changes. Should significant increases in commodities prices occur and should we not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs, our gross margins and profitability would decrease, perhaps significantly. Energy price increases may negatively impact our results of operations.Certain of the components that we use in our manufacturing activities are petroleum-based. In addition, we, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources (including oil) in our facilities and transportation activities. Significant uncertainty currently exists about the future levels of energy prices and significant long-term increases are possible. Increased energy prices could cause an increase to our raw material costs and transportation costs. In addition, increased transportation costs of certain of our suppliers could be passed along to us. We may not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs. In addition, any increase in our product prices may reduce our future customer orders and profitability. We rely on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our sales, and declines in sales to these customers would reduce our net sales and net income. One customer represented more than 10% of our net sales and sales to our ten largest customers represented 49.9% of our net sales during 2011. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our sales. Consolidation among our customers may further concentrate our business in a limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks related to dependence on a small number of customers. In addition, a significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by such a customer would adversely affect our operating results. In the past, some of our large customers have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us as a result of changes demand for their product, consolidations or divestitures or for other reasons. In particular, certain of our customers have from time to time entered into manufacturing divestiture transactions with other EMS companies, and such transactions could reduce our revenues with these customers. We cannot assure you that present or future large customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us, any of which would reduce our net sales and net income. We are subject to risks arising from our international operations. We conduct our international operations primarily in Asia, Latin America, Canada and Europe, and we continue to consider additional opportunities to make foreign acquisitions and construct new foreign facilities. We generated 81.8% of our net sales from non-U.S. operations in 2011 and a significant portion of our manufacturing material was provided by international suppliers during this period. As a result of our international operations, we are affected by economic and political conditions in foreign countries, including: •the imposition of government controls;•compliance with U.S. and foreign laws concerning trade and employment practices;•difficulties in obtaining or complying with export license requirements; 22Table of Contents•trade restrictions;•changes in tariffs;•labor unrest, including strikes, and difficulties in staffing;•inflexible employee contracts in the event of business downturns;•coordinating communications among and managing international operations;•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•currency controls;•increases in duty and/or income tax rates;•adverse rulings in regards to tax audits;•excess costs associated with reducing employment or shutting down facilities;•misappropriation of intellectual property; and•constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices. Our operations in certain foreign locations receive favorable income tax treatment in the form of tax holidays or other incentives. In the event that such tax holidays or other incentives are not extended, are repealed, or we no longer qualify for such programs, our taxes may increase, which would reduce our net income. Additionally, a significant portion of our worldwide cash reserves are generated by, and therefore held in, foreign jurisdictions. Certain of such jurisdictions restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to the U.S or impose taxes and penalties on such transfers of cash. To the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in, or is needed by, our U.S. operations, we may incur significant taxes to repatriate these funds. We operate in countries that have experienced labor unrest and political instability, including China, India, Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia and we have experienced work stoppages and similar disruptions in certain foreign jurisdictions, including India. To the extent such developments prevent us from adequately staffing our plants and manufacturing and shipping products in those jurisdictions, our margins and net income could be reduced and our reputation as a reliable supplier could be negatively impacted.We have taken substantial restructuring charges in the past and we may need to take material restructuring charges in the future. We have incurred significant expenses related to restructuring of our operations in the past and may continue to do so in the future. For example, we have moved, and may continue to move, our operations from higher-cost to lower-cost locations to meet customer requirements. We have incurred costs related to workforce reductions, work stoppages and labor unrest resulting from the closure of our facilities in higher cost locations. In addition, we have incurred unanticipated costs related to the transfer of operations to lower-cost locations, including costs related to integrating new facilities, managing operations in dispersed locations and realigning our business processes. We also have incurred costs to restructure operations that have been acquired in order to integrate them into our Company. We expect to be required to record additional charges related to restructuring activities in the future, but cannot predict the timing or amount of such charges. Any such charges would reduce our net income. Our results can be adversely affected by rising labor costs. There is uncertainty with respect to rising labor costs, in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate. In the past, labor disputes and strikes based partly on wages have slowed or stopped production at certain manufacturers in China and India. In some cases, employers have responded by significantly increasing the wages of workers at such plants. Any increase in labor costs that we are required to make in order to retain qualified personnel and are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could adversely impact our operating results. To respond to competitive pressures and customer requirements, we may further expand internationally in lower cost locations, particularly in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. As we pursue these expansions, we may be required to make additional capital expenditures. In addition, the cost structure in certain countries that are now considered to be favorable may increase as economies develop or as such countries join multinational economic communities or organizations, causing local wages to rise. As a result, we may need to continue to seek new locations with lower costs and the employee and infrastructure base to support electronics manufacturing. We cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated strategic benefits of our international operations or that our international operations will contribute positively to our operating results. As a result of our components ordering policies, and customer-requested ship dates, we may incur carrying costs or not be compensated for components, work-in-process or finished goods, which would decrease our margins and net income.23Table of Contents In order to satisfy customer orders, we are frequently required to order components and other parts in advance of customer payment, particularly for long lead-time items. Furthermore, we may be required to keep additional components, work-in-process and finished goods in inventory in order to meet customer delivery dates. While our supply agreements with our customers generally allocate most of the liability for payment for such items to the customers, we may nonetheless incur additional carrying costs or not ultimately be compensated for these items should the customer default upon its obligations. To the extent we incur any such costs, our gross margins and net income would be reduced. If we manufacture or design defective products, or if our manufacturing processes do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, we could be subject to claims, damages and fines and lose customers. We manufacture products to our customers' specifications, and in some cases our manufacturing processes and facilities may need to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. For example, many of the medical devices that we manufacture, as well as the facilities and manufacturing processes that we use to produce them, are regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration. In addition, our customers' products and the manufacturing processes that we use to produce them often are highly complex. As a result, products that we design or manufacture may at times contain design or manufacturing defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or may not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Defects in the products we design or manufacture may result in product recalls, warranty claims by customers, including liability for repair costs, delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders. If these defects or deficiencies are significant, our results of operations and business reputation could be harmed. The failure of the products that we design or manufacture or of our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may subject us to legal fines or penalties and, in some cases, require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing program or facility. In addition, these defects may result in product liability claims against us. The magnitude of such claims may increase as we expand our medical, automotive, and aerospace and defense manufacturing services because defects could result in death or significant injury to end users of these products. Even if our customers are contractually responsible for defects in the design of a product, we could nonetheless be named in a product liability suit over such defects and could be required to expend significant resources defending ourselves. We sometimes design products on a contract basis or jointly with our customers. The design services that we provide can expose us to different or greater potential liabilities than those we face when providing our regular manufacturing services. For example, we have increased exposure to potential product liability claims resulting from injuries caused by defects in products we design, as well as potential claims that products we design infringe third-party intellectual property rights. Such claims could subject us to significant liability for damages and, regardless of their merits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve. Any such costs and damages could be significant and would reduce our net income. Our business could be adversely affected by any delays, or increased costs, resulting from issues that our common carriers are dealing with in transporting our materials, our products, or both.We rely on a variety of common carriers to transport our materials from our suppliers to us, and to transport our products from us to our customers. Problems suffered by any of these common carriers, whether due to a natural disaster, labor problem, increased energy prices or some other issue, could result in shipping delays, increased costs, or some other supply chain disruption, and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our key personnel are critical to the continued growth of our business and we cannot assure you that they will remain with us. Our success depends upon the continued service of our key personnel. Generally, these employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements. We cannot assure you that we will retain our key employees, particularly our highly skilled operations managers and engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and development of new products and processes. The competition for these employees is intense. In addition, if one or more of our key employees were to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us or otherwise become unavailable to us, we could lose customers and our sales and gross margins could decrease.If we are unable to maintain our technological and manufacturing process expertise, our business could be adversely affected.Improvements to and refinements of our manufacturing processes are necessary to manufacture next generation products for our customers in a cost-efficient manner. As a result, we are continually evaluating the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of new manufacturing processes. In some cases, we will be required to make capital expenditures and incur engineering expense 24Table of Contentsin order to qualify and validate any such new process. Such expenses would reduce our net income. In addition, any delay in the deployment of such new process, or problems commencing volume production using a new process could also reduce our margins and net income and harm our reputation with our customers.Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could increase our taxes and decrease our net income.We are subject to income, sales, value-added and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for taxes and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and other factors. Our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our tax provisions, including through assessment of back taxes, interest and penalties. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions which could lead to an increase in our taxes payable and a decrease in our net income.Our international sales are subject to laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We are required to comply with all applicable domestic and foreign export control laws, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”). Some items manufactured by us are controlled for export by the United States Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security under the EAR. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and international counterparts that bar bribes or unreasonable gifts for foreign governments and officials. Violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including large monetary penalties and suspension or debarment from participation in future government contracts, which could reduce our future revenue and net income. We are subject to a number of U.S. governmental procurement rules and regulations, the failure to comply with which could result in damages or reduction of future revenue. We are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts and subcontracts. Such laws and regulations govern, among other things, price negotiations, cost accounting standards and other aspects of performance under government contracts. These rules are complex and our performance under them is subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other government regulators. If an audit or investigation reveals a failure to comply with regulations or other improper activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions by either the government or the prime customer, including termination of the contract, payment of fines and suspension or debarment from doing further business with the U.S. government. Any of these actions would increase our expenses, reduce our revenue and damage our reputation as a reliable government supplier. We can experience losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which would reduce our net income. Because we manufacture and sell a substantial portion of our products abroad, our operating costs are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar weakens against the foreign currencies in which we denominate certain of our trade accounts payable, fixed purchase obligations and other expenses, the U.S. dollar equivalent of such expenses would increase. We use financial instruments, primarily short-term foreign currency forward contracts, to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations. Our foreign currency hedging activities depend largely upon the accuracy of our forecasts of future sales, expenses, capital expenditures and monetary assets and liabilities. As such, our foreign currency forward contracts may exceed or not cover our full exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. If these hedging activities are not successful, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates. Although we believe our foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances, we can provide no assurances that we will not experience losses arising from currency fluctuations in the future, which could be significant. Any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws could adversely affect our business by causing us to pay significant amounts for cleanup of hazardous materials or for damages or fines. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes in the ordinary course of our manufacturing 25Table of Contentsoperations. We also are subject to laws and regulations governing the recyclability of products, the materials that may be included in products, and the obligations of a manufacturer to dispose of these products after end users have finished using them. If we violate environmental laws or if we occupy or occupied in the past a site at which a predecessor company caused contamination, we may be held liable for damages and the costs of remedial actions. We cannot assure you that we will not violate environmental laws and regulations in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Although we estimate and regularly reassess our potential liability with respect to violations or alleged violations and accrue for such liability, we cannot assure you that our accruals will be sufficient to cover the actual costs we incur as a result of these violations or alleged violations or that no violations will not occur for which a reserve has not been established. Any increase in existing reserves or establishment of new reserves for environmental liability would reduce our net income. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could also limit our ability to expand facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with these laws and regulations. Asbestos containing materials, or ACM, are present at several of our manufacturing facilities. Although the ACM is being managed and controls have been put in place pursuant to ACM operations and maintenance plans, the presence of ACM could give rise to remediation obligations and other liabilities. No governmental or third-party claims relating to ACM have been brought at this time. Our plants generally operate under environmental permits issued by governmental authorities. For the most part, these permits must be renewed periodically and are subject to revocation in the event of violations of environmental laws. Although we have not experienced any material revocations to date, any such revocation could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby having an adverse impact on our results of operations. Primarily as a result of certain of our acquisitions, we have incurred liabilities associated with environmental contamination. These liabilities include ongoing investigation and remediation activities at a number of sites, including those located in Irvine, California; Owego, New York; Derry, New Hampshire; and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. We have been named in a lawsuit alleging operations at our current and former facilities in Orange County, California contributed to groundwater contamination and our Canadian subsidiary is party to an order of the Ontario, Canada Ministry of Environment with respect to our former Brockville site. There can be no assurance that these or any other similar third-party or governmental claims that may be filed in the future will not result in material liability to us. In addition, there are some sites, including our acquired facility in Gunzenhausen, Germany, that are known to have groundwater contamination caused by a third-party, and that third-party has provided indemnity to us for the liability. We have also been named as a potentially responsible party at a contaminated disposal site operated by another party at the Casmalia Resources site in Southern California, as a result of the past disposal of hazardous waste by companies we have acquired or by our corporate predecessors. Although liabilities for such historical disposal activities have not materially affected our financial condition to date, we cannot assure you that past disposal activities will not result in liability that will materially affect us in the future, nor can we provide assurance that we do not have environmental exposures of which we are unaware and which could adversely affect our operating results. Over the years, environmental laws have become, and in the future may continue to become, more stringent, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We operate in several environmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business and environmental groups. Changes in or restrictions on discharge limits, emissions levels, permitting requirements and material storage or handling could require a higher than anticipated level of operating expenses and capital investment or, depending on the severity of the impact of the foregoing factors, costly plant relocation. In addition, the electronics industry became subject to the European Union's RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and WEEE (Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment) directives which took effect beginning in 2005. Parallel initiatives have been adopted in other jurisdictions, including several states in the United States and the People's Republic of China. RoHS prohibits the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires industry OEMs to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components. Although we believe we have implemented procedures to make our manufacturing process RoHS compliant, a successful assertion by a governmental entity of non-compliance could result in significant costs and/or penalties. In the case of WEEE, the compliance responsibility rests primarily with OEMs rather than with EMS companies. However, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their WEEE obligations, which could increase our costs.Consolidation in the electronics industry may adversely affect our business by increasing competition or customer buying power and increasing prices we pay for components. 26Table of ContentsConsolidation in the electronics industry among our customers, our suppliers and/or our competitors may increase as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies. Consolidation in the electronics industry could result in an increasing number of very large electronics companies offering products in multiple sectors of the electronics industry. The significant purchasing and market power of these large companies could increase competitive pressures on us. In addition, if one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide EMS services either because it has its own production facilities or relies on another provider of similar services, we may lose that customer's business. In addition, consolidation in the electronics industry may also result in excess manufacturing capacity among EMS companies, which could drive our profitability down. Similarly, consolidation among our suppliers could result in a sole or limited source for certain components used in our customers' products. Any such consolidation could cause us to be required to pay increased prices for such components, which would reduce our gross margin and profitability. Failure to comply with employment and related laws could result in the payment of significant damages, which would reduce our net income. We are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, including those related to safety, discrimination, whistle-blowing, classification of employees, wages and severance payments. Such laws are subject to change as a result of judicial decisions or otherwise and there can be no assurance that we will not be found to have violated any such laws in the future. Such violations could lead to the assessment of significant fines against us by federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or to the award of damages claims (including severance payments) against us in judicial proceedings by employees, any of which would reduce our net income.Employee theft or fraud could result in loss.Certain of our employees have access to, or signature authority with respect to, bank accounts or other company assets, which could expose us to fraud or theft. In addition, certain employees have access to key IT infrastructure and to customer and other information that is commercially valuable. Should any employee, for any reason, compromise our IT systems, or misappropriate customer or other information, we could incur losses, including losses relating to claims by our customers against us, the willingness of customers to do business with us may be damaged and, in the case of our defense business, we could be debarred from future participation in government programs. Any such losses may not be fully covered by insurance.We may not be successful in implementing and integrating strategic transactions or in divesting non-strategic assets, which could cause our financial results to fail to meet our forecasts. From time to time, we may undertake strategic transactions that give us the opportunity to access new customers and new end-customer markets, to obtain new manufacturing and service capabilities and technologies, to enter new geographic manufacturing locations, to lower our manufacturing costs and improve the margins on our product mix, and to further develop existing customer relationships. Strategic transactions involve many difficulties, uncertainties and costs, including the following: •integrating acquired operations and businesses;•regulatory approvals or other conditions to closing that delay the completing of strategic transactions beyond the time anticipated;•diversion of management attention from day-to-day duties in order to implement and integrate strategic transactions;•scaling up production and coordinating management of operations at new sites;•transaction expenses, including fees of investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which could be significant; •separating operations or support infrastructure for entities divested;•managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations;•maintaining customer, supplier or other favorable business relationships of acquired operations and terminating unfavorable relationships;•integrating the acquired company's systems into our management information systems;•satisfying unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses, including liability for past violations of law, which could require the expenditure of material amounts of cash or subject us to ongoing regulatory scrutiny or requirements;•operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the business acquired in which we may have little or no experience;•improving and expanding our management information systems to accommodate expanded operations; and•losing key employees of acquired operations. Any of these factors could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of a strategic transaction, and our failure to realize these benefits could reduce our sales below and increase our costs above our forecasts and could cause write-downs of 27Table of Contentsthe value of the business acquired which would decrease our net income. Acquisitions may also be dilutive to our earnings per share, particularly if our projections and assumptions about the acquired business' future operating results prove to be inaccurate. As a result, although our goal is to improve our business and maximize stockholder value, any transactions that we complete may ultimately fail to increase our sales and net income and stock price. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or infringe, or are alleged to infringe, upon intellectual property of others, we could lose sales or be required to pay significant amounts in costs or damages. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property. For example, we rely in part upon patents to protect our intellectual property position. However, a number of our patents covering certain aspects of our manufacturing processes or products have expired or will expire in the near future. Such expirations reduce our ability to assert claims against competitors or others who use or sell similar technology. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights would diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology. We are also subject to the risk that former employees violate the terms of their proprietary information agreements with us which require them to keep confidential and not to use for their benefit information obtained in the course of their employment with us. Should a key former employee use or disclose such information, including information concerning our customers, pricing, capabilities or strategy, our ability to obtain new customers and to compete could be adversely impacted. Finally, we may occasionally become involved in administrative proceedings, lawsuits or other proceedings if others allege that we infringe on their intellectual property rights. Some of these claims could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our property rights. If successful, such claims could impair our ability to collect royalties or license fees or could force us or our customers to: •stop producing products that use the challenged intellectual property;•obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property, at our expense, a license to sell the relevant technology at an additional cost, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or•redesign those products or services that use the infringed technology. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, costs and net income and could damage our reputation with our customers. In addition, any type of intellectual property lawsuit, whether initiated by us or a third party, would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management's time and attention. We may not have sufficient insurance coverage for certain of the risks and liabilities we assume in connection with the products and services we provide to our customers, which could leave us responsible for certain costs and damages incurred by our customers. We carry various forms of business and liability insurance in amounts we believe are reasonable and customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. However, we do not have insurance coverage for all of the risks and liabilities we assume in connection with the products and services we provide to our customers, such as potential warranty, product liability, intellectual property infringement, product recall claims and losses due to hacking or intrusion into our IT infrastructure. As a result, such liability claims may not be covered under our insurance policies. Should we sustain a significant uncovered loss, our net income would be reduced. Changes in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, changes in securities laws and regulations have increased, and are likely to continue to increase, our operating costs. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. Our preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of those assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the recorded amounts of expenses during the reporting period. A change in the facts and circumstances surrounding those estimates could result in a change to our estimates and could impact our future operating results. In addition, these principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies. A change in those policies can have a significant effect 28Table of Contentson our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions which are completed before a change is announced. Accounting policies affecting many other aspects of our business, including rules relating to revenue recognition, off-balance sheet transactions, stock-based compensation, restructurings, acquisition accounting, asset disposals and asset retirement obligations, leases, intangible assets, derivative and other financial instruments and in-process research and development charges, have recently been revised or are under review. Changes to those rules or the questioning of how we interpret or implement those rules may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business. For example, a preliminary timetable by which U.S. companies would adopt International Financial Reporting Standards has been promulgated by the SEC. Although at a very early stage of consideration by regulatory agencies, adoption of such standards could substantially change our reporting practices in a number of areas, including revenue recognition and recording of assets and liabilities. Finally, corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices continue to evolve based upon continuing legislative action, SEC rulemaking and stockholder advisory group policies. As a result, the number of rules and regulations applicable to us may increase, which would also increase our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time management must devote to compliance activities. For example, the SEC has issued proposed rules requiring disclosure of the extent to which we use certain minerals in the production of our products and California has enacted regulations requiring disclosure of our business practices intended to reduce the risk of human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain. Increasing regulatory burdens could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers in light of an increase in actual or perceived workload and liability for serving in such positions. Outages, computer viruses, break-ins and similar events could disrupt our operations. We rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for a variety of functions, including worldwide financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and email communications. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions. If we or our vendors are unable to prevent such outages and breaches, our operations could be disrupted. The market price of our common stock is volatile.The stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of companies, including companies in the EMS business. These fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. The market for our common stock has been and may in the future be subject to similar volatility. Factors such as fluctuations in our operating results, announcements by our competitors or other events affecting companies in the electronics industry, currency fluctuations, general market fluctuations, and macro economic conditions may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and global events. We conduct a significant portion of our activities including manufacturing, administration and information technology management in areas that have experienced natural disasters, such as major earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and tsunamis. For example, in March 2011, Japan experienced a major earthquake and tsunami and in October 2011, flooding occurred in large parts of Thailand. Our insurance coverage with respect to damages to our facilities or our customers' products caused by natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. In the event of a major earthquake or other disaster affecting one or more of our facilities, our operations and management information systems, which control our worldwide procurement, inventory management, shipping and billing activities, could be significantly disrupted. Such events could also delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment for the time required to transfer production or repair, rebuild or replace the affected manufacturing facilities. This time frame could be lengthy and result in significant expenses for repair and related costs. While we have in place disaster recovery plans, there can be no assurance that such plans will be sufficient to allow our operations to continue in the event of every natural or man-made disaster, pandemic or other extraordinary event. Any extended inability to continue our operations at unaffected facilities following such an event would reduce our revenue and potentially damage our reputation as a reliable supplier. Our profitability could be adversely impacted by climate change initiatives. 29Table of ContentsConcern over climate change has led to state, federal and international legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. While we don't expect existing or currently proposed initiatives to directly impact our business operations, these measures could lead to an increase in the cost of energy used in the manufacture of our products as a result of restrictions placed upon power generators and distributors. We can't currently estimate the impact of any such indirect costs. However, should our operating costs in fact rise as a result of any current, proposed or future greenhouse gas initiatives, and we are not able to pass such costs to our customers, our profitability would be reduced.
