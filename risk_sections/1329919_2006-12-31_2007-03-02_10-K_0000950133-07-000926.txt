Item 1A. Risk Factors We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. This discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results would likely suffer. 13 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry The markets for our on-demand software and solutions are emerging, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects and may increase the risk of your investment. The market for software specifically designed for public relations is relatively new and emerging, making our business and future prospects difficult to evaluate. Many companies have invested substantial personnel and financial resources in their PR departments, and may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to on-demand software and services specifically designed to address the public relations market. Widespread market acceptance of our solutions is critical to the success of our business. You must consider our business and future prospects in light of the challenges, risks and difficulties we encounter in the new and rapidly evolving market of on-demand public relations management solutions. These challenges, risks and difficulties include the following:  generating sufficient revenue to maintain profitability;  managing growth in our operations;  managing the risks associated with developing new services and modules;  attracting and retaining customers; and  attracting and retaining key personnel. We may not be able to successfully address any of these challenges, risks and difficulties, including the other risks related to our business and industry described below. Failure to adequately do so could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. If our on-demand solutions are not widely accepted, our business will be harmed. We derive, and expect to continue to derive for the foreseeable future, principally all of our revenue from providing on-demand solutions. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of companies to increase their use of on-demand solutions in general and for on-demand public relations software and services in particular. If businesses do not perceive the benefits of our on-demand solutions, then the market may not develop further, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A substantial majority of our on-demand solutions are sold pursuant to subscription agreements, and if our existing subscription customers elect either not to renew these agreements or renew these agreements for fewer modules or users, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. A substantial majority of our on-demand solutions are sold pursuant to annual subscription agreements and our customers have no obligation to renew these agreements. As a result, we are not able to consistently and accurately predict future renewal rates. Our subscription customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate or our subscription customers may renew for fewer modules or users as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our solutions, budgetary or other concerns, and the availability and pricing of competing products. Additionally, we may lose our subscription customers due to the high turnover rate in the PR departments of small and mid-sized organizations. If large numbers of existing subscription customers do not renew these agreements, or renew these agreements on terms less favorable to us, and if we cannot replace or supplement those non-renewals with new subscription agreements generating the same or greater level of revenue, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. Because we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable subscription agreement, the lack of subscription renewals or new subscription agreements may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We recognize revenue from our subscription customers over the term of their subscription agreements. The majority of our quarterly revenue usually represents deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into 14 during previous quarters. As a result, a decline in new or renewed subscription agreements in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue for the corresponding quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Additionally, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solutions may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Our business model continues to evolve, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate or decline. Our business model continues to evolve, and is therefore subject to additional risk and uncertainty. For example, through our acquisition of PRWeb International, Inc. in August 2006, we began providing online press release distribution. We anticipate that our future financial performance and revenue growth will depend, in part, upon the growth of these services. Unlike our traditional, subscription-based model, we recognize revenue from our online news distribution services on a per transaction basis when our customers press releases are made available to the public. In 2006, transaction revenue was not significant; however, we expect transaction revenue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues in the future. Since our transaction revenue is not derived from contracted recurring services, the amount of transaction revenue we recognize in any period could fluctuate significantly from prior periods, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We might not generate increased business from our current customers, which could limit our revenue in the future. The success of our strategy is dependent, in part, on the success of our efforts to sell additional modules and services to our existing customers and to increase the number of users per subscription customer. These customers might choose not to expand their use of or make additional purchases of our solutions. If we fail to generate additional business from our current customers, our revenue could grow at a slower rate or decrease. If our information database does not maintain market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We have developed our own content that our customers began using in place of a significant portion of the third-party content that had been included in the information database that we make available to our customers through our on-demand software. In August 2005, we began providing this internally-developed content to our customers. If our internally-developed content does not maintain market acceptance, current subscription customers may not continue to renew their subscription agreements with us, and it may be more difficult for us to acquire new subscription customers. It may become necessary for us to license content from third parties, and such content may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur operating losses in the future. We have incurred operating losses in the past and we may incur operating losses in the future. Our recent operating losses were $2.7 million for 2004, $4.9 million for 2005, and $1.1 million for 2006. We expect our operating expenses to increase as we expand our operations, and if our increased operating expenses exceed our expected revenue growth, we may not be able to achieve operating income. You should not consider recent quarterly revenue growth as indicative of our future performance. In fact, in future quarters we may not have any revenue growth or our revenue could decline. Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of investors or securities analysts which could cause our stock price to decline. Our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly revenue or results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our results of 15 operations may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below and identified throughout this Risk Factors section:  our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers;  changes in the volume and mix of subscriptions sold and press releases distributed in a particular quarter;  seasonality of our business cycle, given that our subscription volumes are normally lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter;  our policy of expensing sales commissions at the time our customers are invoiced for a subscription agreement, while the majority of our revenue is recognized ratably over future periods;  the timing and success of new product introductions or upgrades by us or our competitors;  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;  the amount and timing of expenditures related to expanding our operations;  changes in accounting policies or the timing of non-recurring charges;  changes in the payment terms for our products and services; and  the purchasing and budgeting cycles of our customers. Most of our expenses, such as salaries and third-party hosting co-location costs, are relatively fixed in the short-term, and our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. As a result, if revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations, we may not be able to proportionally reduce operating expenses for that quarter, causing a disproportionate effect on our expected results of operations for that quarter. Due to the foregoing factors, and the other risks discussed in this report, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. We face competition, and our failure to compete successfully could make it difficult for us to add and retain customers and could reduce or impede the growth of our business. The public relations market is fragmented, competitive and rapidly evolving, and there are limited barriers to entry to some segments of this market. We expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future as existing competitors develop their capabilities and as new companies enter our market. Increased competition could result in pricing pressure, reduced sales, lower margins or the failure of our solutions to achieve or maintain broad market acceptance. If we are unable to compete effectively, it will be difficult for us to maintain our pricing rates and add and retain customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed. We face competition from:  PR solution providers offering products specifically designed for PR;  generic desktop software and other commercially available software not specifically designed for PR;  outsourced PR service providers; and  custom-developed solutions. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, a larger presence in the general PR market, access to larger customer bases and substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, management, service, support and other resources than we have. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services than we can. To the extent our competitors have an existing relationship with a potential customer, that customer may be unwilling to switch vendors due to existing time and financial commitments with our competitors. We also expect that new competitors, such as enterprise software vendors and online service providers that have traditionally focused on enterprise resource planning or back office applications, will enter the on-demand 16 public relations management market with competing products as the on-demand public relations management market develops and matures. Many of these potential competitors have established or may establish business, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers, alliance partners or other third parties or may combine and consolidate to become more formidable competitors with better resources. It is possible that these new competitors could rapidly acquire significant market share. If we fail to respond to evolving industry standards, our on-demand solutions may become obsolete or less competitive. The market for our on-demand solutions is characterized by changes in customer requirements, changes in protocols and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to enhance or develop new features for our existing solutions or develop acceptable new solutions that keep pace with these changes, our on-demand software and services may become obsolete, less marketable and less competitive and our business will be harmed. The success of any enhancements, new modules and on-demand software and services depends on several factors, including timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of our solutions. Failure to produce acceptable new offerings and enhancements may significantly impair our revenue growth and reputation. If there are interruptions or delays in providing our on-demand solutions due to third-party error, our own error or the occurrence of unforeseeable events, delivery of our solutions could become impaired, which could harm our relationships with customers and subject us to liability. All of our solutions reside on hardware that we own or lease and operate that is currently located in two third-party facilities maintained and operated in Virginia and Washington. Our third-party facility providers do not guarantee that our customers access to our solutions will be uninterrupted, error-free or secure. Our operations depend, in part, on our third-party facility providers ability to protect systems in their facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. In the event that our third-party facility arrangements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service or damage to such third-party facilities, we could experience interruptions in our service as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services. Our disaster recovery computer hardware and systems located at our headquarters in Lanham, Maryland, have not been tested under actual disaster conditions and may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage occurring at our third-party facilities. We are in the process of establishing a disaster recovery site for our Washington facility. In the event of a disaster in which one of our third-party facilities was irreparably damaged or destroyed, we could experience lengthy interruptions in our service. Moreover, our disaster recovery computer hardware and systems are located within the same geographic region as one of our third-party facilities and may be equally or more affected by any disaster affecting such third-party facility. Any or all of these events could cause our customers to lose access to our on-demand software. In addition, the failure by our third-party facilities to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions in such service or impede our ability to scale our operations. We architect the system infrastructure and procure and own or lease the computer hardware used for our services. Design and mechanical errors, spikes in usage volume and failure to follow system protocols and procedures could cause our systems to fail, resulting in interruptions in our service. Any interruptions or delays in our service, whether as a result of third-party error, our own error, natural disasters or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with customers and our reputation. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could reduce our revenue, subject us to liability, and cause us to issue credits or cause customers to fail to renew their subscriptions, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 The market for our solutions among large customers may be limited if they require customized features or functions that we do not currently intend to provide in our solutions or that would be difficult for individual customers to customize within our solutions. Prospective customers, especially large enterprise customers, may require heavily customized features and functions unique to their business processes. If prospective customers require customized features or functions that we do not offer, and that would be difficult for them to implement themselves, then the market for our solutions will be more limited and our business could suffer. Acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business. One of our business strategies is to continue to selectively acquire companies which would either expand our solutions functionality, provide access to new customers or markets, or both. An acquisition may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired organizations, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, and we may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership. Acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. We also may experience lower rates of renewal from subscription customers obtained through acquisitions than our typical renewal rates. Moreover, we cannot provide assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities. In connection with one or more of these transactions, we may:  issue additional equity securities that would dilute the ownership of our stockholders;  use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;  incur or assume debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;  incur large charges or substantial liabilities;  encounter difficulties retaining key employees of an acquired company or integrating diverse business cultures; and  become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges. To date, we have completed several acquisitions. For example, in November 2004 we acquired substantially all of the assets of Gnossos Software, Inc., and in August 2006 we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of PRWeb International, Inc. In each of these transactions, the consideration we paid included both cash and shares of our common stock. The issuance of shares of our common stock diluted the ownership of our existing stockholders, and the cash consideration paid reduced the cash available to us for other purposes. Failure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our solutions. Increasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our solutions will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our sales and marketing operations. We plan to continue to expand our direct sales force and engage additional third-party channel partners, both domestically and internationally. This expansion will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. Our business will be seriously harmed if our efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our direct sales force if we are unable to hire and develop talented direct sales personnel, if our new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or if we are unable to retain our existing direct sales personnel. We also may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from our third-party channel partners if we are unable to attract and retain additional motivated third-party channel partners, if any existing or future third-party channel partners fail to successfully market, resell, implement or support our solutions for their customers, or if they represent multiple providers and devote greater resources to market, resell, implement and support competing products and services. 18 If we fail to develop our brands cost-effectively, our business may suffer. We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of our brands in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. Successful promotion of our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful solutions. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands. Our online press release and news distribution is a trusted information source. To the extent we were to distribute an inaccurate or fraudulent press release, our reputation could be harmed. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer. We may be liable to our customers and may lose customers if we provide poor service, if our solutions do not comply with our agreements or if there is a loss of data. The information in our databases may not be complete or may contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant. Our ability to collect and report data may be interrupted by a number of factors, including our inability to access the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems or failure by our third-party facilities to meet our capacity requirements. In addition, computer viruses and intentional or unintentional acts of our employees may harm our systems causing us to lose data we maintain and supply to our customers or data that our customers input and maintain on our systems, and the transmission of computer viruses could expose us to litigation. Our subscription agreements generally give our customers the right to terminate their agreements for cause if we materially breach our obligations. Any failures in the services that we supply or the loss of any of our customers data that we cannot rectify in a certain time period may give our customers the right to terminate their agreements with us and could subject us to liability. As a result, we may also be required to spend substantial amounts to defend lawsuits and pay any resulting damage awards. In addition to potential liability, if we supply inaccurate data or experience interruptions in our ability to supply data, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers. Although we maintain general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, this coverage may be inadequate, or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that this policy will cover any claim against us for loss of data or other indirect or consequential damages and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert managements attention. If our solutions fail to perform properly or if they contain technical defects, our reputation will be harmed, our market share would decline and we could be subject to product liability claims. Our on-demand software may contain undetected errors or defects that may result in product failures or otherwise cause our solutions to fail to perform in accordance with customer expectations. Because our customers use our solutions for important aspects of their business, any errors or defects in, or other performance problems with, our solutions could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. If that occurs, we could lose future sales or our existing subscription customers could elect to not renew. Product performance problems could result in loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance and the diversion of development resources. If one or more of our solutions fail to perform or contain a technical defect, a customer may assert a claim against us for substantial damages, whether or not we are responsible for our solutions failure or defect. We do not currently maintain any warranty reserves. Product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or arbitration/dispute resolution or to pay significant settlements or damages. Although we maintain general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, this coverage may not be sufficient to cover liabilities resulting from such product liability claims. Also, our insurer may disclaim coverage. Our liability insurance also may not continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all. Any product liability claim successfully brought against us could cause our business to suffer. 19 Changes in laws and/or regulations related to the Internet or changes in the Internet infrastructure itself may cause our business to suffer. The future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business applications. Federal, state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting data privacy, the use of the Internet as a commercial medium and the use of email for marketing or other consumer communications. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the Internet or for sending commercial email. These laws or charges could limit the growth of Internet-related commerce or communications generally, result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services such as ours and reduce the demand for our products. The Internet has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience, significant user and traffic growth, which has, at times, caused user frustration with slow access and download times. If Internet activity grows faster than Internet infrastructure or if the Internet infrastructure is otherwise unable to support the demands placed on it, or if hosting capacity becomes scarce, our business growth may be adversely affected. If we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights, it will reduce our ability to compete for business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market products similar to our products, which could decrease demand for our solutions. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures, to protect our intellectual property rights. These protections may not be adequate to prevent our competitors from copying our solutions or otherwise infringing on our intellectual property rights. Existing laws afford only limited protection for our intellectual property rights and may not protect such rights in the event competitors independently develop solutions similar or superior to ours. In addition, the laws of some countries in which our solutions are or may be licensed do not protect our solutions and intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. If a third-party asserts that we are infringing its intellectual property, whether successful or not, it could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses, and our business may be harmed. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Third-parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of lawsuits, letters, or other forms of communication. As currently pending patent applications are not publicly available, we cannot anticipate all such claims or know with certainty whether our technology infringes the intellectual property rights of third-parties. We expect that the number of infringement claims in our market will increase as the number of solutions and competitors in our industry grows. These claims, whether or not successful, could:  divert managements attention;  result in costly and time-consuming litigation;  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all; or  require us to redesign our solutions to avoid infringement. 20 As a result, any third-party intellectual property claims against us could increase our expenses and adversely affect our business. In addition, many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us resulting from an adverse ruling in any such claim. Even if we have not infringed any third-parties intellectual property rights, we cannot be sure our legal defenses will be successful, and even if we are successful in defending against such claims, our legal defense could require significant financial resources and managements time, which could adversely affect our business. Our growth could strain our personnel and infrastructure resources, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. Rapid growth in our headcount and operations may place a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2006, the number of our full time equivalent employees increased by approximately 160%, from 106 to 276. We anticipate that additional growth will be required to address increases in our customer base, as well as expansion into new geographic areas. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To date, we have not experienced any significant problems as a result of the rapid growth in our headcount, other than occasional office space constraints. However, our anticipated future growth may place greater strains on our resources. For instance, if our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees as needed, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. The additional headcount and capital investments we expect to add will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan. We are dependent on our executive officers, and the loss of any of them may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner if at all. Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our development personnel that require them to remain our employees nor do the employment agreements we have with our executive officers require them to remain our employees and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty. We do not currently maintain key man life insurance on any of our executives, and such insurance, if obtained in the future, may not be sufficient to cover the costs of recruiting and hiring a replacement or the loss of an executives services. The loss of one or more of our key employees could seriously harm our business. We may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth. To execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for senior sales executives and engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than us. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment. Significant volatility in the price of our stock may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees. Furthermore, changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States relating to the expensing of stock options may discourage us from granting 21 the size or type of stock options awards that job candidates require to join our company, and may result in our paying additional cash compensation to job candidates to offset reduced stock option grants. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. Because we conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions, which accounted for approximately 7% of our 2006 revenues, and because our business strategy includes expanding our international operations, our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations. We have small but growing international operations and our business strategy includes expanding these operations. Conducting international operations subjects us to new risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These include:  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;  difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;  potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; and  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards. The occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international operations and, consequently, our results of operations generally. In addition, the Internet may not be used as widely in international markets in which we expand our international operations and, as a result, we may not be successful in offering our solutions internationally. We might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new solutions or enhance our existing solutions, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in further equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, FASB now requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options. Such stock option expensing required us, beginning in 2006, to value our employee stock option grants pursuant to a fair value-based model, and then recognize that value against our reported earnings over the vesting period in effect for those options. Prior to 2006, we had accounted for stock-based awards to employees in accordance with the intrinsic value method. The intrinsic value method generally results in recording less expense than the fair value method for stock- 22 based awards. This change in accounting treatment materially and adversely affected our reported results of operations. We discuss more fully the adoption of the new rules for accounting for stock-based awards in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 2 and Note 11 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Compliance with new regulations governing public company corporate governance and reporting is uncertain and expensive. Many new laws, regulations and standards, notably those adopted in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices and have created uncertainty for public companies. These new laws, regulations and standards are subject to interpretations due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by varying regulatory bodies. This may cause continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Our implementation of these reforms and enhanced new disclosures may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a significant diversion of managements time and attention from revenue-generating activities. Any unanticipated difficulties in implementing these reforms could result in material delays in complying with these new laws, regulations and standards or significantly increase our operating costs. Risks Related to our Common Stock and the Securities Markets If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline. The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. There are many large, well-established publicly traded companies active in our industry and market, which may mean it will be less likely that we receive widespread analyst coverage. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. Volatility of our stock price could adversely affect stockholders. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:  quarterly variations in our operating results;  seasonality of our business cycle;  interest rate changes;  changes in the markets expectations about our operating results;  our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the on-demand software industry in general;  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;  news reports relating to trends in our markets;  changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;  material announcements by us or our competitors;  sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and  general economic and political conditions such as recessions and acts of war or terrorism. 23 The concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters. As of December 31, 2006, our executive officers, directors and affiliated entities together beneficially owned approximately 38% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:  establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;  provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 662/3 percent of our stockholders;  require super-majority voting to amend our bylaws or specified provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation;  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;  limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;  prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;  provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, or repeal our bylaws; and  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Future sales, or the availability for sale, of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline. Our directors and officers hold shares of our common stock that they generally are currently able to sell in the public market. We have also registered shares of our common stock that are subject to outstanding stock options, or reserved for issuance under our stock option plan, which shares can generally be freely sold in the public market upon issuance. In addition, certain stockholders have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or for other stockholders. Moreover, many of our executive officers and directors have established trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for the purpose of effecting sales of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could materially impair our future ability to raise capital through offerings of our common stock.
