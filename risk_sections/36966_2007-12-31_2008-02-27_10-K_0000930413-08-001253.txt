ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS This item outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our various businesses to compete, change our risk profile, or eventually impact our financial results. The risks we face generally are similar to those experienced, to varying degrees, by all financial services companies. Our strategies and managements ability to react to changing competitive and economic environments have enabled us historically to compete effectively and manage risks to acceptable levels. However, our operating environment continues to evolve and new risks continue to emerge. To address that challenge we have established an enterprise-wide risk management committee that oversees processes for monitoring evolving risks and oversees various initiatives designed to manage and control our potential exposure. We have outlined potential risk factors below that we presently believe could be important to us; however, other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict with certainty all potential developments which could affect our financial performance. The following discussion highlights potential risks which could intensify over time or shift dynamically in a way that might change our risk profile. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report (including the material incorporated into this report), among the factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from our past results and from expectations are those discussed in this item. Forward-Looking Statements This report, including materials incorporated into it, may contain forward-looking statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, and estimates. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not a representation of historical information but rather are related to future operations, 14 strategies, financial results or other developments. The words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, should, is likely, will, going forward, and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond any companys control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisions and actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change. Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other important factors: general and local economic and business conditions; expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial services institution; market and monetary fluctuations; inflation or deflation; customer and investor responses to these conditions; the financial condition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry; geopolitical developments including possible terrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness of our hedging practices; technology; demand for our product offerings; new products and services in the industries in which we operate; and critical accounting estimates. Other factors are those inherent in originating, selling, and servicing loans including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles. Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and other regulators; regulatory, administrative, and judicial proceedings and changes in laws and regulations applicable to us; and our success in executing our business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, could cause actual results to differ. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that are made in this report or in any other statement, release, report, or filing from time to time. Actual results could differ because of one or more factors, including those presented below, in other sections of this report, or in material incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this report should carefully consider the factors discussed in this Item below, among others, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects. Competition Risks Like all financial services companies, we compete for customers. Our primary areas of competition include: retail and commercial deposits and bank loans, wealth management, home mortgage loans and lines of credit, mortgage servicing, capital markets products and services, and other consumer and business financial products and services. Our competitors in these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, and other financial services companies that serve the markets which we serve. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products and services. For additional information regarding competition for customers, refer to the Competition heading of Part I, Item 1 beginning on page 12 of this report. While we face competition for customers, we also compete for financial capital (see Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks beginning on page 19 of this report) and to acquire and retain the human capital we need to thrive. Labor markets change over time; the segments of that market most useful to us may contract with demographic shifts relating to age, birth rates, education levels, geography, local or regional economic conditions, and other factors. Some of the keys to our ability to manage our competitive challenges are: 15  Our leading position in many of our markets and business lines  Our historical growth and retention of consumer and business customers  Historically strong employee value and loyalty ratings and national workplace recognition resulting in attraction and retention of high performing employees Using those factors and others, we have focused on the delivery of products and services in a manner that maximizes the value our customers obtain from their relationships with us, and we have developed strategies that have enabled us to gain market share in our targeted markets over time. We also have developed strategies to attract customers and talent that are displaced when competitors merge. Growth and Disposition Risks Every organization faces risks associated with growth. Our growth in recent years has resulted primarily from a combination of: our expansion strategy in banking; acquisition of customers from competitors that have merged with each other; and targeted non-bank business acquisitions. In 2007 we modified our growth strategy in response to substantial and rapid changes in business conditions and to take advantage of certain opportunities. Although our growth strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions continue to change, at present our strategy has two primary components: to invest capital and other resources in our current Tennessee-based retail/commercial banking market footprints; and to continue to expand our capital markets business into a broader range of products, services, and customers. In any case in 2008 growth is expected to be coordinated with a focus on stronger and more stable returns on capital. Our growth has been and at present continues to be primarily organic rather than through substantial acquisitions. We believe that the successful execution of our growth strategy depends upon a number of key elements, including:  our ability to attract and retain banking customers in our Tennessee market areas;  in our capital markets business, our ability to successfully identify and exploit opportunities for new products and services, and for new customers, in the US and overseas, while at the same time maintaining or strengthening our existing customer relationships in that business;  our ability to develop and retain profitable customer relationships while expanding our existing information processing, technology, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently; and  our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with organic growth. We have in place a number of strategies designed to achieve each of those elements. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them as conditions change. To the extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face various risks associated with that practice, including:  our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the contingent risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately;  our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively;  our ability to integrate the name recognition and goodwill of the acquired company with our own; and,  our ability to retain customers and key employees of the acquired company. 16 At times a company must consider disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses or units that no longer fit into managements plans for the future. Key risks associated with dispositions, including closures, include:  our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate appropriate terms;  our ability to identify and implement key customer and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses;  our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the disposed or exited business had with our retained businesses; and  our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise in the event of a closure or other disposition that results in significant cash expenditures or a financial loss to us. Credit Risks Like all other lenders, we face the risk that our customers may not repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a loss. In our business some level of credit loss is unavoidable and overall levels of credit loss can vary over time. Our ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and the value of collateral, including real estate. We control credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio and managing its granularity, and by recording and managing an allowance for expected loan losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We also record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. These guidelines and rules could change and cause charge-offs to increase for reasons related or unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio; such changes by the OCC and other banking agencies have been common in recent years. This risk is shared with all financial institutions. Moreover, the SEC could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the OCC or other regulators for the Bank. The models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans are regularly updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and other collateral values, and in the economy, among other things, based on our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. Additional information concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forth under the captions Credit Risk Management beginning on page 34, Foreclosure Reserves beginning on page 47, and Allowance for Loan Losses beginning on page 48, of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Insurance We use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction of property, legal and other liability, and certain types of credit risks. Not all such risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, we also face the risk that the insurer may default on its obligations or refuse to honor them. We treat the former risk as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when feasible and practical. The latter risk is inherent in any contractual situation. A portion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financial results. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified and the disruption to the default insurance industry could curtail our ability to originate new loans that need such insurance, which would result in a loss of business for us. Risk From Economic Downturns and Changes Delinquencies and credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure on collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness), deposit products, fixed income products, and financial services may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand for loans and other financial products and services such as (for example) changes in interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economic change (local, regional, or national) can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, and lower fees from transactions and services. These risks are faced by all financial services companies and we have in place processes and tools that we believe allow us to monitor and manage those risks. 17 Hedge Risks In the normal course of our businesses, including (among others) banking, mortgage, and capital markets, we attempt to create partial or full economic hedges of various, though not all, financial risks. We do that primarily by using derivative instruments or by engaging in business activities that we believe are countercyclical to the risks at issue. Our hedging activities are discussed in more detail in various places under the following captions of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report: Risk Management, beginning on page 27; and, Critical Accounting Policies, beginning on page 42. Hedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Although we actively manage those risks, unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings. Reputation Risks Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and our financial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our own practices and how those practices are perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation. Damage to our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk. As with all other risks, we actively devote significant resources to safeguard our reputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, and management. Operational Risks Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon our ability to create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage an increasingly complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate processes; faulty or disabled computer systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and related security breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties; and exposure to other external events. In addition, we outsource some of our operational functions to third parties. Those third parties may experience similar errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in some cases, limited ability to quickly obtain an alternate vendor. To the extent we increase our reliance on third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes more difficult. 18 Failure to build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, or noncompliance with applicable laws or regulatory standards. Operational risk is specifically managed through internal monitoring, measurement, and assessment by line management and oversight of processes by top management. Operational risk also is mitigated by following regulatory guidance. Additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them appears under the caption Operational Risk Management beginning on page 34 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks Management of liquidity and related risks is a key function for our business. Additional information concerning liquidity risk management is set forth under the caption Liquidity Management beginning on page 30 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Our funding requirements currently are met principally by deposits, financing from other financial institutions, and financing from institutional investors by means of the capital markets. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. A number of factors could make such funding more difficult, more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results, organizational changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets, and may become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond our control. To a certain degree we depend on our ability to sell or securitize first and second mortgage loans and, in the past, home equity line of credit loans (which we refer to as HELOC). Those actions involve the sale of whole loans or of beneficial interests in loans. Although the market for loans traditionally has been substantial, if it experiences disruptions we may be unable to sell or securitize our mortgage or HELOC loans at favorable or profitable pricing levels, or at all. If we are unable to continue to sell or securitize our loans, we seek alternative funding sources to fund loan originations and meet our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to find cost-effective and stable alternatives, that failure can negatively impact our liquidity and can potentially increase our cost of funds and lower our loan growth. Moreover, such disruptions: (i) can force us to significantly and disadvantageously change our loan products and product mix; (ii) can temporarily or indefinitely reduce our loan origination flow and the resulting revenues; and, (iii) as to loans originated prior to such disruptions, can result in our selling such loans at an immediate loss or our keeping them on our balance sheet or both. Keeping pre-disruption loans on our balance sheet can adversely impact our liquidity and capital ratios, and can expose us to losses both immediately and later due to the effects of accounting rules that require us to adjust certain loan values to the lower of cost or market (sometimes referred to as a LOCOM adjustment). Disruptions of this sort in 19 fact occurred in 2007, as did many of the impacts outlined above; see Recent Downturns and Disruptions beginning on page 24 of this report for further information. Events affecting interest rates, markets, and other factors which adversely impact our ability or desire to access the capital markets for funding likewise may adversely affect the demand for our services in our capital markets business. As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit as well as in our retail/commercial banking and mortgage banking units. For instance, the disruptions in 2007 that were primarily related to mortgages and mortgage-backed assets significantly reduced the current demand for certain of our capital markets products and services, and increased the costs and uncertainties associated with our mortgage servicing business. When we sell or securitize mortgage and HELOC loans, we sometimes do with varying degrees of recourse, which means, in effect, that we retain some of the risk for the loan if it defaults. In many instances we sell or securitize loans with no recourse. A loan sold with recourse generally means we retain substantial or full responsibility if it defaults. For a loan sold with no recourse, we could still bear responsibility to the buyer in many cases if the loan defaults early or is paid off early (typically within the first 90 days), or if the loan does not conform to representations we made to the buyer at the time of sale. In those cases usually we would satisfy our obligations to the buyer by repurchase or substitution of an eligible loan. Typically we have similar obligations for breach of representations or warranties, or early default, if the loan is included on a non-recourse basis in a securitization transaction. We manage the early default risk through our credit review processes, and we manage the risk of non-conformity through origination and documentation controls and procedures, and through post-closing quality control processes. Additional information concerning these risks is set forth under the caption Foreclosure Reserves beginning on page 47 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Rating agencies assign credit ratings to issuers and their debt. In that role, agencies directly affect the availability and cost of our funding. The Corporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating entities for unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating of Baa3 or higher by Moodys Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for many purposes. At the present time, all three rating agencies rate the unsecured senior debt of the Corporation and the Bank as investment grade. Because we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of funding if our debt ratings were lowered, particularly if lowered below investment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect the cost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Regulatory laws or rules that establish minimum capital levels, regulate deposit insurance, and govern related funding matters for banks could be changed in a manner that could increase our overall cost of capital and thus reduce our earnings. Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks A significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money. Accordingly, changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, and potentially could expand or compress our net interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. Additional information concerning 20 those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Interest Rate Risk Management beginning on page 28 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Our mortgage lending and servicing businesses also are affected by changes in interest rates. Generally, when rates increase, demand for mortgage loans and HELOC tend to decrease (and our revenues from new originations tend to fall), and when rates decrease, demand tends to increases (and our origination revenues tend to increase). In a contrary fashion, when interest rates increase, the value of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) that we retain generally increases, and when rates decline the value of MSR tends to declines. However, those general tendencies do not result in concrete outcomes in all circumstances; for example, a decrease in interest rates does not always result in an increased volume of loan originations even if MSR values are affected negatively because other factors may blunt loan demand or curtail credit availability. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Mortgage Servicing Rights and Other Related Retained Interests beginning on page 43 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Our mortgage lending business is affected by changes in interest rates in another manner. During the period of loan origination (when loans are in the pipeline) and prior to the loans sale in the secondary market (when loans are in the warehouse), we are exposed to the risk of interest rate changes for those pipeline loans which we have agreed to lock in the customers mortgage rate and for all warehouse loans that bear a fixed rate. We manage that rate-change risk through hedging activities and other methods; however, it is not possible to eliminate all such risks, and a rate change is just one of the risks that could impact the demand for, and thus the value of, our pipeline and warehouse loans. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Pipeline and Warehouse beginning on page 46 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Like all financial services companies, we face the risks associated with movements in the yield curve. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-term rates are equal, or nearly equal, to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve normally is positively sloped. However, recently the yield curve has been relatively flat or inverted for protracted periods. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, as yields on the warehouse narrow relative to their short-term funding sources, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities, adversely impacting the revenues of our capital markets business. A prolonged inversion of the yield curve historically is so uncommon that it is difficult to predict all the effects that such a market condition is reasonably likely to create. One such effect upon us was an overall increase in the cost of hedging mortgage servicing rights (MSR) in our mortgage business. This cost is tied to factors including volatility in the market place, the shape of the yield curve, product duration, risk tolerance and other effects which may favorably or unfavorably impact hedging cost. Lastly, expectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements, particularly long-term rates, can impact the demand for long-term debt which in turn can impact the revenues of our capital markets business. That risk is most apparent during times when strong 21 expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain. Securities Inventories and Market Risks Our capital markets business buys and sells various types of securities for its institutional customers. In the course of that business we hold inventory positions and are exposed to certain risks of market fluctuations. In addition, we are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with debt securities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities through certain policies and procedures, including hedging activities related to certain interest rate risks. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Market Risk Management beginning on page 34 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report, and in the Credit Risks discussion beginning on page 17 of this report. In addition, we earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business and our management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources. Venture Capital Risks Our venture capital business is inherently volatile. The companies we invest in tend to be much less mature, smaller, and much more unproven than a typical public company. Accordingly, those investments carry a substantial risk of loss. Venture capital investments also are inherently illiquid. Success in this business can only be assessed in the long term and depends to a very large extent upon the ability of management to find sound investment prospects, negotiate financially appropriate investment terms, and oversee each investment as the company uses the venture capital and develops. In the short term, venture capital losses are not uncommon even if the business proves to be successful in the long term. Regulatory and Legal Risks We operate in a heavily regulated industry and therefore are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, insurance brokerage, securities brokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 3 above, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areas of employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities occasionally consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, or could materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulations also could expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions, restricting our ability to share or receive customer information and increasing our costs. In addition, changes in accounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. The Bank is required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios, as discussed under the caption Capital Adequacy beginning on page 6 of this report. If the Bank experiences financial losses, its ability to meet those requirements may be strained. Pressure to maintain capital and capital ratios during times of financial loss, especially protracted loss, may lead to actions that are adverse to our shareholders. Those actions could include, among other things, reductions in our common dividend, the sale of the Banks or our stock at a time when market prices are disadvantageous, and a contraction of our balance sheet (involving sales or other dispositions of assets or businesses) at a time when market values are depressed. 22 Some state authorities have from time to time challenged the position of the OCC that it is the exclusive regulator of various aspects of national banks or their operating subsidiaries. If one or more of those challenges were successful, or if Congress or the OCC were to change the applicable banking laws or regulations, we could be impacted significantly, due, among other things, to possible increased regulatory burdens, governmental and private party actions alleging non-compliance with state law, and the expense of tracking and complying with the different laws and regulations of nearly all 50 states. We also face litigation risks from customers, employees, vendors, contractual parties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or state regulators. Litigation is an unavoidable part of doing business, and we seek to manage those risks through internal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with certainty. Holding Company Dividends Historically the Corporation has depended upon common dividends from the Bank for cash to fund common dividends paid to the Corporation’s shareholders. Because the Bank experienced a loss for 2007, however, regulatory constraints will prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividends to the Corporation in 2008 unless and until the Bank’s earnings are greater than $74.0 million plus preferred dividends. The Bank has regulatory permission to declare preferred dividends payable in April 2008, which are estimated to total approximately $4 million. Additional information concerning those regulatory restrictions on the Bank is discussed in more detail under the heading “Liquidity Management” in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section beginning on page 30 of the Corporation’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which section is incorporated herein by reference. At December 31, 2007 the Corporation, on a non-consolidated basis, had approximately $215.9 million cash on hand. The Corporation paid a dividend of 45 cents per share, or approximately $56.5 million, in early January, 2008 and has declared a dividend of 20 cents per share, or approximately $25.1 million, payable in April, 2008, representing a rate reduction of over 50%. Due to the foregoing circumstances and certain other commitments of the Corporation, the Corporation’s common dividend could be at risk of further reduction unless the Bank’s earnings ease the regulatory constraints. Accounting Estimate Risks The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Two of our most critical estimates are the level of the allowance for credit losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. However, other estimates occasionally become highly significant, especially in volatile situations such as litigation and other loss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points in time; as actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our mortgage servicing rights, goodwill, or other assets, or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. For additional information concerning the sensitivity of these estimates, refer to Critical Accounting Policies beginning on page 42 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders. Risks of Expense Control Expenses and other costs directly affect our earnings. Our ability to successfully manage expenses is important to our long-term survival. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As our businesses change or expand, additional expenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. We manage expense growth and risk through a variety of means, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes. Geographic Risks Our mortgage and capital markets businesses are national in scope, and capital markets is developing in selected international markets. Our traditional banking business remains grounded in, and depends upon, the major Tennessee markets. As a result, to a greater degree than many of our competitors that operate nationally or in much broader regions, our banking business currently is exposed to adverse economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that might primarily impact Tennessee and the mid-South region of the US. 23 Non-US Operations Risks In 2007 we expanded our capital markets business by opening an office in Hong Kong, our first office outside of the United States. Opening and operating non-US offices creates a number of risks. Specific risks associated with any non-US presence include: the risk that taxes, licenses, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may be created or increased by the US or other countries that would impact our ability to operate overseas profitably or at all; the risk that our assets and operations in a particular country could be nationalized in whole or part without adequate compensation; the risk that currency exchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish or destroy the US dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the US dollar value of liabilities, denominated in those currencies; and the risk that political or cultural preferences in a particular host country might become antagonistic to US companies. Our ability to manage those and other risks will depend upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differences in cultural and other expectations applicable to customers, employees, regulators, and vendors and other business partners; our ability to recognize and act upon opportunities and constraints peculiar to the countries and cultures in which our offices operate; our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed; and our ability to anticipate the stability of or changes in the political, legal, and monetary systems of the countries in which our offices operate. Recent Downturns and Disruptions In 2007 several downturns and disruptions occurred in markets which are important to our businesses, and similar or additional adverse events may occur in the future. Although those events did not create new types of risks, we believe it is useful to highlight some of the key impacts of those events on our business to illustrate how events beyond our control can adversely affect us. Some of the significant recent downturns and disruptions relevant to mortgage and related businesses include:  residential housing values in the US have stagnated or fallen, and in some highly-populated markets values have fallen significantly;  the volume of residential housing transactions also has stagnated or fallen, and in some markets volume has fallen significantly;  investor demand for mortgage-backed securities fluctuated suddenly and sharply, and for some categories of mortgages disappeared almost entirely;  except for conforming loans, which are loan products conforming to standards of certain government sponsored entities, rates for some types of home mortgage products have risen sharply and some mortgage products, with new and more restrictive credit criteria, have become difficult for borrowers to obtain even at high interest rates, making it difficult or impossible for some borrowers to refinance an existing mortgage;  many mortgage borrowers in recent years have obtained adjustable-rate products, and it is possible that many will adjust to higher rates, and therefore higher payments, in the near future;  fear has been expressed by some public officials and others that mortgage-related defaults, foreclosures, and personal bankruptcies have risen and will rise significantly in the future;  the US Congress and other governmental bodies have considered, and in the future may enact or adopt, new laws and regulations intended to modify the terms of outstanding mortgage loans in a manner benefiting borrowers at the expense of lenders, restrict the ability of lenders to make new loans, and increase the regulatory burdens and legal risks on mortgage lenders and servicers; and 24  the Federal Reserve has acted recently to lower certain short-term interest rates, possibly to help ameliorate the impacts of the disruptions in housing and the mortgage industry, which has triggered reductions in the prime lending rates charged by most US banks. Some of the significant actual and potential impacts of those events on one or more of our businesses include:  abrupt loss in value of loans held in our pipeline and warehouse at times when investor demand decreased sharply  the loans were priced appropriately when we made our loan commitments but those prices were below market levels by the time the loans could be sold to investors;  pressures on our liquidity in the mortgage business as investor demand shrank and the securitization markets diminished or, for some products, disappeared;  significant reduction in our ability to create gains on sale of mortgage loans we originate;  significant reduction in mortgage origination volume and fees;  significant reduction in the volume of and the fees from certain capital markets structured finance activities;  significant increase in delinquencies in some loan products and markets which are related to mortgages and housing;  significant increase in loan loss provision for loans secured by, or directly related to, mortgages and the housing industry,  significant volatility in our mortgage servicing rights (MSR) assets and mortgage servicing business, with correspondingly volatile impacts on our earnings from quarter to quarter;  significant increase in costs of servicing mortgages due to increased credit remediation and loss mitigation activity, as well as increased collection and foreclosure activity;  the possibility that falling US prime rates in 2008 could compress our net interest margin; and  the possibility that, in 2008, adjustable rate HELOC loans that are tied to falling US prime rates could be drawn more fully and could be pre-paid less often so that, in conjunction with falling housing values, the ratio of HELOC loan balances to current actual values may weaken which could, in turn, translate into higher loan losses and higher provisioning for future losses within the HELOC portfolio.
