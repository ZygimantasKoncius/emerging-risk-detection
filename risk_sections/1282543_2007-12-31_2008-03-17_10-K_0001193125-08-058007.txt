Item 1A. Risk Factors Our largest stockholder controls a significant percentage of our common stock and its interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders. New Affirmative LLC (New Affirmative) beneficially owns approximately 51.0% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, New Affirmative exercises significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our charter documents and significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business. The interests of New Affirmative with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as future acquisitions, financings and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. New Affirmatives continued concentrated ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. Future issuances or sales of our common stock, including under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisition activities, may adversely affect our common stock price. As of the date of this filing, we had an aggregate of 57,231,279 shares of our common stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes. In general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders. We have reserved 3,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under our equity incentive plan, of which 1,795,171 shares are issuable upon vesting and exercise of options granted as of the date of this filing, including exercisable options of 708,875 as of December 31, 2007. In addition, we may pursue acquisitions of competitors and related businesses and may issue shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock, and any sale or issuance of our common stock will dilute the percentage ownership held by our stockholders. New Affirmative, our largest stockholder, beneficially owns approximately 51.0% of our common stock. New Affirmative has certain demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares of our common stock it beneficially owns. Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock by our largest stockholder, New Affirmative, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Since we are a controlled company for purposes of The NASDAQ Global Select Markets corporate governance requirements, our stockholders will not have, and may never have, the protections that these corporate governance requirements are intended to provide. Since we are a controlled company for purposes of The NASDAQ Global Select Markets corporate governance requirements, we are not required to comply with the provisions requiring that a majority of our directors be independent, the compensation of our executives be determined by independent directors or nominees for election to our board of directors be selected by independent directors. As a result, our stockholders will not have, and may never have, the protections that these rules are intended to provide. The board of directors has determined that Paul J. Zucconi, Suzanne T. Porter, Thomas C. Davis and Nimrod T. Frazer are independent under The NASDAQ Global Select Markets listing standards. Because of our significant concentration in non-standard personal automobile insurance and in a limited number of states, our profitability may be adversely affected by negative developments and cyclical changes in the industry or negative developments in these states. Substantially all of our gross premiums written and our commission income and fees is generated from sales of non-standard personal automobile insurance policies. As a result of our concentration in this line of business, 18 negative developments in the business, economic, competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the non-standard personal automobile insurance industry could have a negative effect on our profitability and would have a more pronounced effect on us as compared to more diversified companies. Examples of such negative developments would be increasing trends in automobile repair costs, automobile parts costs, used car prices and medical care expenses, increased regulation, as well as increased litigation of claims and higher levels of fraudulent claims. All of these events can result in reduced profitability. In addition, the non-standard personal automobile insurance industry historically has been cyclical in nature, characterized by periods of severe price competition and excess underwriting capacity followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity. In the late 1990s, many non-standard personal automobile insurers attempted to capture more business by reducing rates. We believe that these industry-wide rate reductions, combined with increased costs per claim during the period, contributed to the deterioration of industry loss ratios in the years 1999 through 2001. We believe that in 2002 through 2004, the underwriting results in the non-standard personal automobile insurance business improved as a result of favorable pricing and competitive conditions that allowed for broad increases in rate levels by insurers, including us. In late 2004 and continuing through 2007, increased price competition and excess underwriting capacity produced a softening market. These fluctuations in the non-standard personal automobile insurance business cycle may negatively impact our profitability. Our financial results may be adversely affected by conditions in the states where our business is concentrated. Our business is concentrated in a limited number of states. For the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately 32.7% of our gross premiums written related to policies issued to customers in Louisiana, 15.7% to customers in Texas and 15.1% to customers in Illinois. Our revenues and profitability are therefore subject to prevailing regulatory, legal, economic, demographic, competitive and other conditions in these states. Changes in any of these conditions could make it less attractive for us to do business in these states and could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Intense competition could adversely affect our profitability. The non-standard personal automobile insurance business is highly competitive and, except for regulatory considerations, there are relatively few barriers to entry. Our insurance companies compete with other insurance companies that sell non-standard personal automobile insurance policies through independent agencies as well as with insurance companies that sell such policies directly to their customers. Our retail agencies and the independent agencies that sell our insurance products compete both with these direct writers and with other independent agencies. Therefore, our competitors are not only large national insurance companies, but also smaller regional insurance companies and independent agencies. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer a broader range of products or competing products at lower prices. In addition, existing competitors may attempt to increase market share by lowering rates and new competitors may enter this market, particularly larger insurance companies that do not presently write non-standard personal automobile insurance. In this environment, we may experience a reduction in our underwriting margins or sales of our insurance policies may decrease as individuals purchase lower-priced products from other insurance companies. A loss of business to competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages could negatively affect our revenues and net income. In addition to selling policies for our own insurance companies, our retail stores offer and sell non-standard personal automobile insurance policies for unaffiliated insurance companies. As a result, our insurance companies compete with these unaffiliated insurance companies for sales to the customers of our owned retail stores. If the competing insurance products offered by an unaffiliated insurance company are priced lower or have more attractive features than the insurance policies offered by our insurance companies, customers of our retail stores may decide not to purchase insurance policies from our insurance companies and may instead 19 purchase policies from the unaffiliated insurance company. A loss of business by our insurance companies resulting from our retail stores selling relatively more policies of unaffiliated insurance companies and fewer policies of our insurance companies could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. Our retail stores would, however, earn commission income and fees from the unaffiliated insurance companies for the sales of their policies. Our success depends on our ability to price accurately the risks we underwrite. The results of our operations and the financial condition of our insurance companies depend on our ability to underwrite and set premium rates accurately for a wide variety of risks. Rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price our products accurately, we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data; develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully, and as a result price our products accurately, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control, including:  the availability of sufficient reliable data and our ability to properly analyze available data;  the uncertainties that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions;  our selection and application of appropriate rating and pricing techniques; and  unanticipated changes in legal standards, claim settlement practices, medical care expenses and automobile repair costs. Consequently, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our sales volume and competitiveness. In either event, the profitability of our insurance companies could be materially and adversely affected. If our actual losses and loss adjustment expenses exceed our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, we will incur additional charges to earnings. We maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability for losses and the related loss adjustment expenses for both reported and unreported claims on insurance policies issued by our insurance companies. The establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process, involving actuarial and statistical projections of what we expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims based on historical claims information, estimates of future trends in claims severity in multiple markets and other variable factors such as inflation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves, it has been necessary, and will continue to be necessary, to revise estimated future liabilities as reflected in our reserves for claims and related expenses. We cannot be sure that our ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses will not materially exceed our reserves. To the extent that our reserves prove to be inadequate in the future, we would be required to increase our reserves for losses and the related loss adjustment expenses and incur a charge to earnings in the subsequent period during which such reserves are increased, which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the subsequent period. In addition, we have a limited history in establishing reserves, and our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses may not necessarily accurately predict future trends in our models to assess these amounts. 20 We may not be successful in reducing our risk and increasing our underwriting capacity through reinsurance arrangements, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In order to reduce our underwriting risk and increase our underwriting capacity, we may choose to transfer portions of our insurance risk to other insurers through reinsurance contracts. Historically, we have ceded a portion of our non-standard automobile insurance premiums and losses to unaffiliated reinsurers in accordance with these contracts. The availability, cost and structure of reinsurance protection is subject to changing market conditions that are outside of our control. In order for these contracts to qualify for reinsurance accounting and thereby provide the additional underwriting capacity that we might need, the reinsurer generally must assume significant risk and have a reasonable possibility of a significant loss. Reinsurance may not be continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates that are currently available. Although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent we transfer, or cede, risk to the reinsurer, we remain ultimately liable to the policyholder on all risks reinsured. As a result, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not limit our ultimate obligations to policyholders to pay claims. We are subject to credit risks with respect to the financial strength of our reinsurers. We are also subject to the risk that our reinsurers may dispute their obligations to pay our claims. As a result, we may not recover claims made to our reinsurers in a timely manner, if at all. In addition, if insurance departments deem that under our existing or future reinsurance contracts the reinsurer does not assume significant risk and has a reasonable possibility of significant loss, we may not be able to increase our ability to write business based on this reinsurance. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may incur significant losses if Vesta Fire Insurance Corporation (VFIC), which currently has an A.M. Best financial strength rating of F (In Liquidation) or any of our other reinsurers, do not pay our claims in a timely manner. Although our reinsurers are liable to us to the extent we transfer risk to the reinsurers, we remain ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks reinsured. Consequently, if any of our reinsurers cannot pay their reinsurance obligations, or dispute these obligations, we remain liable to pay the claims of our policyholders. In addition, our reinsurance agreements are subject to specified contractual limits on the amounts and types of losses covered, and we do not have reinsurance coverage to the extent our losses exceed those limits or are not of the type reinsured. As of December 31, 2007, we had a total of $66.8 million of receivables from reinsurers, including $17.1 million gross recoverable from VFIC. We have, with the approval of the VFIC Special Deputy Receiver and the District Court, Austin, Texas, withdrawn $5.8 million from the trust securing our reinsurance recoverables from VFIC, which represented 100% of the amount we paid in losses as of the date of the withdrawal covered by the VFIC reinsurance. We have made arrangements with the VFIC Special Deputy Receiver to submit quarterly statements for approval to withdraw additional funds from the trust based upon losses paid. VFIC currently has been assigned a financial strength rating of F (In Liquidation) from A.M. Best. According to A.M. Best, F ratings are assigned to companies that have been placed under an order or liquidation by a court of law or whose owners have voluntarily agreed to liquidate the company. If any of our reinsurers are unable or unwilling to pay amounts they owe us in a timely fashion, we could suffer a significant loss, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because we have reduced our use of quota share reinsurance, we have retained more risk, which could result in losses. We have historically used quota share reinsurance primarily to increase our underwriting capacity and to reduce our exposure to losses. Quota share reinsurance is a form of pro rata reinsurance arrangement in which the reinsurer participates in a specified percentage of the premiums and losses on every risk that comes within the scope of the reinsurance agreement in return for a portion of the corresponding premiums. 21 We have reduced our use of quota share reinsurance. As a result, we retain and earn more of the premiums we write, but we also retain more of the related losses. We generally enter into quota share reinsurance agreements that cover business written through our underwriting agencies in specified states or regions. Reducing our use of quota share reinsurance increases our risk and exposure to such losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to comprehensive regulation that may restrict our ability to earn profits. We are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as in the states where our subsidiaries sell insurance products, issue policies and handle claims. Certain states impose restrictions or require prior regulatory approval of certain corporate actions, which may adversely affect our ability to operate, innovate, obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or grow our business profitably. These regulations provide safeguards for policy owners and are not intended to protect the interests of stockholders. Our ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable expense and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success.  Required licensing. We operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. If a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license, our ability to enter that market quickly or offer new insurance products in that market might be substantially impaired.  Transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates. Transactions between our insurance companies and their affiliates generally must be disclosed to state regulators, and prior approval of the applicable regulator generally is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated. State regulators may refuse to approve or delay approval of such a transaction, which may impact our ability to innovate or operate efficiently.  Restrictions on cancellation, non-renewal or withdrawal. Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurance companys ability to exit a market. For example, certain states limit an automobile insurance companys ability to cancel or not renew policies. Some states prohibit an insurance company from withdrawing from one or more lines of business in the state, except pursuant to a plan approved by the state insurance department. In some states, this applies to significant reductions in the amount of insurance written, not just to a complete withdrawal. These laws and regulations could limit our ability to exit or reduce our writings in unprofitable markets or discontinue unprofitable products in the future.  Other regulations. We must also comply with state and federal regulations involving, among other things:  the use of non-public consumer information and related privacy issues;  the use of credit history in underwriting and rating;  limitations on types and amounts of investments;  premium finance laws and regulations of the various states in which we do business;  the payment of dividends;  the acquisition or disposition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company;  involuntary assignments of high-risk policies, participation in reinsurance facilities and underwriting associations, assessments and other governmental charges;  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;  SEC reporting; 22  reporting with respect to financial condition; and  periodic financial and market conduct examinations performed by state insurance department examiners. Compliance with laws and regulations addressing these and other issues often will result in increased administrative costs. In addition, these laws and regulations may limit our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent us from obtaining timely rate increases necessary to cover increased costs and may restrict our ability to discontinue unprofitable relationships or exit unprofitable markets. These results, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability to grow our business in certain jurisdictions. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in actions by regulators, fines and penalties, and in extreme cases, revocation of our ability to do business in that jurisdiction. In addition, we may face individual and class action lawsuits by our insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. Regulation may become more extensive in the future, which may adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that states will not make existing insurance-related laws and regulations more restrictive in the future or enact new restrictive laws. New or more restrictive regulation in any state in which we conduct business could make it more expensive for us to conduct our business, restrict the premiums we are able to charge or otherwise change the way we do business. In such events, we may seek to reduce our writings in, or to withdraw entirely from these states. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. We are unable to predict whether and to what extent new laws and regulations that would affect our business will be adopted in the future, the timing of any such adoption and what effects, if any, they may have on our operations, profitability and financial condition. New pricing, claim, coverage and financing issues and class action litigation are continually emerging in the automobile insurance industry, and these new issues could adversely impact our revenues or our methods of doing business. As automobile insurance industry practices and regulatory, judicial and consumer conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims, coverages, business practices and premium financing plans may emerge. These issues can have an adverse effect on our business by changing the way we price our products, by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent, or by increasing the size of claims. Recent examples of some emerging issues include:  concerns over the use of an applicants credit score and zip code as a factor in making risk selections and pricing decisions;  a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting automobile insurers, including us, in purported class action litigation relating to claims-handling practices, such as the permitted use of aftermarket (non-original equipment manufacturer) parts, total loss evaluation methodology and the alleged diminution in value to insureds vehicles involved in accidents;  a relatively new trend of plaintiffs targeting insurers, including automobile insurers, in purported class action litigation which seek to recharacterize installment fees and other allowed charges related to insurers installment billing programs as interest that violates state usury laws or other interest rate restrictions; and  attempts by plaintiffs to initiate purported class action litigation targeting premium finance operations relating to unearned interest rebates and the collection of service and finance charges. The effects and costs of these and other unforeseen emerging issues could negatively affect our revenues, income or our methods of business. 23 Our insurance companies are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action. Our insurance companies are subject to risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable state laws, including the laws of their state of domicile. The risk-based capital standards, based upon the Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, require our insurance companies to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to state departments of insurance and the NAIC. These risk-based capital standards provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending upon the ratio of an insurance companys total adjusted capital, as calculated in accordance with NAIC guidelines, to its authorized control level risk-based capital. Authorized control level risk-based capital is the number determined by applying the NAICs risk-based capital formula, which measures the minimum amount of capital that an insurance company needs to support its overall business operations. Failure to meet applicable risk-based capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements could subject us to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, state supervision or liquidation. Any changes in existing risk-based capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements may require us to increase our statutory capital levels. At December 31, 2007, each of our insurance subsidiaries maintained a risk-based capital level that was in excess of an amount that would require any corrective actions on our part. Our failure to pay claims accurately could adversely affect our business, financial results and capital requirements. We must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training and experience of our claims representatives, the culture of our claims organization and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and other factors. Our failure to pay claims accurately could lead to material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image, as a result, and negatively affect our financial results. In addition, if we do not train new claims employees effectively or if we lose a significant number of experienced claims employees, our claims departments ability to handle an increasing workload as we grow could be adversely affected. In addition to potentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets, we could suffer decreased quality of claims work, which in turn could lower our operating margins. If we are unable to retain and recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could be hindered. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategies and could materially and adversely affect our business, growth and profitability. We do not have key person insurance on the lives of any of our executive officers. We may encounter difficulties in implementing our strategies of expanding into new markets and acquiring agencies. Our growth strategy includes expanding into new geographic markets, introducing additional insurance and non-insurance products and acquiring the business and assets of underwriting and retail agencies. Our future growth will face risks, including risks associated with our ability to:  obtain necessary licenses;  properly design and price our products; 24  identify, hire and train new claims and sales employees;  identify agency acquisition candidates; and  assimilate and integrate the operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of the acquired companies. We may also encounter difficulties in connection with implementing our growth strategy, including unanticipated expenditures, damaged or lost relationships with customers and independent agencies and contractual, intellectual property or employment issues relating to companies we acquire. In addition, our growth strategy may require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience. Further, any potential agency acquisitions may require significant capital outlays, and if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to pay for an acquisition, these securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stockholders or the issuance may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Once agencies are acquired, we could suffer increased costs, disruption of our business and distraction of our management if we are unable to smoothly integrate the agencies into our operations. Our expansion will also continue to place significant demands on our management, operations, systems, accounting, internal controls and financial resources. Any failure by us to manage our growth and to respond to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our underwriting operations are vulnerable to a reduction in the amount of business written by independent agencies. For the year ended December 31, 2007, independent agencies were responsible for approximately 35.3% of the gross premiums produced by our underwriting agencies. As a result, our business depends in part on the marketing efforts of independent agencies and on our ability to offer insurance products and services that meet the requirements of these independent agencies and their customers. Independent agencies are not obligated to sell or promote our products, and since many of our competitors rely significantly on the independent agency market, we must compete with other insurance companies and underwriting agencies for independent agencies business. Some of our competitors offer a larger variety of products, lower prices for insurance coverage or higher commissions, and we therefore may not be able to continue to attract and retain independent agencies to sell our insurance products. A material reduction in the amount of business our independent agencies sell would negatively impact our revenues. If we are unable to establish and maintain relationships with unaffiliated insurance companies to sell their non-standard personal automobile policies through our owned retail stores, our sales volume and profitability may suffer. Our owned retail stores sell non-standard personal automobile insurance policies for our insurance companies and also for unaffiliated insurance companies. Particularly in soft markets, our commitment to underwriting discipline may result in declining sales of our insurance companies policies in favor of lower-priced products from other insurance companies willing to accept less attractive underwriting margins. Consequently, part of our strategy in a soft market is to generate increased commission income and fees from sales of third-party policies through our retail stores relationships with unaffiliated underwriting agencies and insurance companies. If our retail stores are unable to establish and maintain these relationships, they would have a more limited selection of non-standard personal automobile insurance policies to sell. In such an event, our retail stores might experience a net decline in overall sales volume of non-standard personal automobile insurance policies, which would decrease our profitability. 25 If our insurance companies, which currently have A.M. Best financial strength ratings of B, fail to maintain commercially acceptable financial strength ratings, our ability to implement our business strategies successfully could be significantly and negatively affected. Financial strength ratings are important in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and could have an effect on an insurance companys sales. A.M. Best, generally considered to be a leading authority on insurance company ratings and information, has currently assigned three of our insurance companies ratings of B (Fair). The B rating is the seventh highest of fifteen rating categories that A.M. Best assigns to insurance companies, ranging from A++ (Superior) to F (In Liquidation). According to A.M. Best, B ratings are assigned to insurers that have a fair ability to meet their current obligations to policyholders but are financially vulnerable to adverse changes in underwriting or economic conditions. This rating reflects A.M. Bests opinion of our ability to pay claims and is not an evaluation directed to investors regarding an investment in our common stock. In evaluating an insurance companys financial and operating performance, A.M. Best reviews its profitability, leverage and liquidity, as well as its book of business, the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance, the quality and estimated market value of its assets, the adequacy of its loss reserves, the adequacy of its surplus, its capital structure, the experience and competence of its management and its market presence. In addition, A.M. Best evaluated the insurance companys ownership and the capital structure of any parent company. Our insurance companies ratings are subject to change at any time and may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of A.M. Best. A.M. Bests ratings reflect its opinion of an insurance companys financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed to potential or current investors in our common stock or recommendations to buy, sell or hold our common stock. Our insurance companies ratings are subject to change at any time and may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of A.M. Best. Because lenders and reinsurers will use our A.M. Best ratings as a factor in deciding whether to transact business with us, the current ratings of our insurance companies or their failure to maintain the current ratings may dissuade a financial institution or reinsurance company from conducting any business with us or may increase our borrowing costs or reinsurance costs. We face litigation, which if decided adversely to us, could adversely impact our financial results. We are a party in a number of lawsuits. These lawsuits are described more fully elsewhere in this report. Litigation, by its very nature, is unpredictable and the outcome of these cases is uncertain. The precise nature of the relief that may be sought or granted in any lawsuits is uncertain and may, if these lawsuits are determined adversely to us, negatively impact our earnings. In addition, potential litigation involving new claim, coverage and business practice issues could adversely affect our business by changing the way we price our products, extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increasing the size of claims. Recent examples of some emerging issues include a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting automobile insurers in purported class action litigation relating to claims handling practices such as total loss evaluation methodology and the alleged diminution in value to insureds vehicles involved in accidents and the relatively new trend of plaintiffs targeting insurers, including automobile insurers, in purported class action litigation which seeks to recharacterize installment fees and other allowed chargers related to insurers installment billing programs as interest that violates state usury laws or other interest rate restrictions. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claims, coverage and business practice issues could negatively impact our profitability or our methods of doing business. 26 Adverse securities market conditions can have a significant and negative impact on our investment portfolio. Our results of operations depend in part on the performance of our invested assets. As of December 31, 2007, our investment portfolio was completely invested in fixed-income securities. Certain risks are inherent in connection with fixed maturity securities including loss upon default and price volatility in reaction to changes in interest rates and general market factors. In general, the fair value of a portfolio of fixed-income securities increases or decreases inversely with changes in the market interest rates, while net investment income realized from future investments in fixed-income securities increases or decreases along with interest rates. In addition, some of our fixed-income securities have call or prepayment options. This could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall and issuers call their securities. We attempt to mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates, so that only a portion of the portfolio will mature at any point in time. Furthermore, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates. If market interest rates were to change 1.0% (for example, the difference between 5.0% and 6.0%), the fair value of our fixed-income securities would change approximately $4.1 million. The change in fair value was determined using duration modeling assuming no prepayments. We are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants under our current credit facility that may restrict our business and financing activities. Our credit facility contains restrictive debt covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:  Borrow money;  Pay dividends and make distributions;  Issue stock;  Make certain investments;  Use assets as security in other transactions;  Create liens;  Enter into affiliate transactions;  Merge or consolidate; or  Transfer and sell assets Our credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial tests, and our need to meet the requirements of these financial tests may limit our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with the provisions contained in our credit facility may be affected by changes in our business condition or results of operation, adverse regulatory developments, or other events beyond our control. Our failure to comply with the terms of these provisions could result in a default under our credit facility which, in turn, could cause all or a substantial portion of our debt to become immediately due and payable. If our debt under the credit facility was to be accelerated, we cannot assure that we would be able to repay it. In addition, a default would give our lender the right to terminate any commitment to provide us with additional funds under our credit facility. 27 We rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and the failure of these systems could disrupt our operations. Our business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our current information technology and telecommunications systems as well as our future integrated policy and claims system. We rely on these systems to process new and renewal business, provide customer service, make claims payments and facilitate collections and cancellations, as well as to perform actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for pricing and product development. As a result, the failure of these systems could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business and provide customer service or compromise our ability to pay claims in a timely manner. This could result in a material adverse effect on our business. As part of our efforts to continue improving our internal control over financial reporting, we are upgrading and transforming our existing information technology system. We may experience difficulties in transitioning to new or upgraded systems, including loss of data and decreases in productivity until personnel become familiar with new systems. In addition, our management information systems will require modification and refinement as we grow and as our business needs change, which could prolong difficulties we experience with systems transitions, and we may not always employ the most effective systems for our purposes. If we experience difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or experience significant system failures, or if we are unable to successfully modify our management information systems and respond to changes in our business needs, our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations. Severe weather conditions and other catastrophes may result in an increase in the number and amount of claims filed against us. Our business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophic events, such as rainstorms, snowstorms, hail and ice storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires and other events such as explosions, terrorist attacks and riots. The incidence and severity of catastrophes and severe weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. Such conditions generally result in higher incidence of automobile accidents and an increase in the number of claims filed, as well as the amount of compensation sought by claimants. As a holding company, we are dependent on the results of operations of our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations and pay future dividends. We are organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries, which include our agency subsidiaries and our insurance company subsidiaries. We cannot pay dividends to our stockholders and meet our other obligations unless we receive dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries, including our insurance company subsidiaries. State insurance laws limit the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends and require our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus. In addition, for competitive reasons, our insurance companies need to maintain financial strength ratings which require us to maintain certain levels of capital and surplus in those subsidiaries. The need to maintain these capital and surplus levels may affect the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. Under state insurance laws, dividends from our insurance companies, which must be paid from earned surplus, are subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus and earnings. Prior approval from state insurance regulatory authorities is generally required in order for our insurance companies to declare and pay extraordinary dividends. In most states, an extraordinary dividend is defined as any dividend or distribution that, together with 28 other distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurance companys statutory surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurance companys statutory net income for the 12-month period ending the preceding December 31. Without regulatory approval, the aggregate maximum amount of dividends that can be paid in 2008 to us by our insurance company subsidiaries is approximately $18.6 million. During 2007, our insurance company subsidiaries paid total dividends of $13.1 million and as a result, the maximum dividend capacity of $18.6 million is not immediately available. The aggregate maximum amount of dividends permitted by law to be paid by an insurance company does not necessarily indicate an insurance companys actual ability to pay dividends. The actual ability to pay dividends may be further constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, which could affect an insurance companys ratings, competitive position, amount of premiums that can be written, and ability to pay future dividends. State insurance regulators have broad discretion to limit the payment of dividends by insurance companies and our rights to participate in any distribution of assets of our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to prior claims of policyholders and creditors, except to the extent that our rights, if any, as a creditor are recognized. As a result, a prolonged, significant decline in the profits of our insurance company subsidiaries or regulatory action limiting dividends could subject us to shortages of cash because our insurance company subsidiaries would not be able to pay us dividends. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS On February 19, 2008, we received a comment letter from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking further clarification and expansion of certain disclosures we made in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The comment letter requests that we provide further explanation of: (i) how the increase in gasoline prices in mid-2005 was responsible for our favorable claim frequency trend in 2006; (ii) how and to what extent the risks arising from our reliance on certain third party-generated information affects our financial reporting in terms of estimating our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses; and (iii) (in the context of SOP 98-7), the specific risks transferred, resulting accounting classifications and the revenue recognition method utilized under certain novation and quota share reinsurance agreements to which we are currently a party. The comment letter further requests that we indicate the periodic SEC filing in which we intend to include our responsive explanations to the foregoing requests. On March 4, 2008, we filed our written response to the SECs comment letter, wherein we indicated that our responsive explanations would be included in this Form 10-K.
