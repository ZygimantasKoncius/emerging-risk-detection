Risk Factors section of this report. The Company has historically financed its operations primarily from equity capital. 38 On August 1, 2011 the Company completed the sale of its consumer products business to Pharm -a-Care Laboratories Pty Limited for a total sale price of A$10.1 million in cash. On September 30, 2011, the Company purchased 1,333,333 shares of common stock of MEI for an aggregate cash purchase price of US$2 million. In December 2011 Novogen Limited made an additional investment of US$2 million in MEI with the purchase 1,941,747 common shares. On March 26, 2012, MEI’s registration statement on Form S-1, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, became effective. The Form S-1 was filed in connection with MEI’s rights offering (“Rights Offering”) to its existing stockholders and to holders of MEI’s Series A warrants issued in connection with the May 2011 private placement. Following approval by its shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on May 7, 2012, Novogen Limited invested US$4 million in MEI under the MEI rights offering with the purchase of 8,988,674 units, amounting to 4,494,337 common shares and warrants to purchase 2,247,168 common shares at a unit price of US$1.19 per share. These warrants will expire in May 2017. Novogen owned 63.5% of MEI at June 30, 2012. The subscription period for the Rights Offering expired on May 11, 2012. Eligible participants exercised subscription rights to purchase 11,660,606 Units under the offering, including 8,988,675 Units purchased by Novogen Limited (described above). Based on the irrevocable exercise of the subscription rights, MEI issued 5,830,202 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase 2,915,152 shares upon exercise of the warrants (subject to adjustment for fractional shares). Gross proceeds of US$5.2 million were received in connection with the Rights Offering. There are no commitments for capital expenditure outstanding at the end of the financial year. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements “Financial Instruments” for disclosures about financial risk management including interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and liquidity risk. Research and Development Research and development policy Expenditure during the research phase of a project is recognised as an expense when incurred. Development costs are capitalised only when technical feasibility studies identify that the project will deliver future economic benefits and these benefits can be measured reliably. Development costs have a finite life and are amortised on a systematic basis matched to the future economic benefits over the useful life of the project. The Company spent A$5.4 million, A$4.4 million and A$8.1 million on gross research and development expenditure during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively. All of these costs have been recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income in the respective periods. Due to the nature and uncertainty of the research and development projects being undertaken by the Company, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost and timing of project completion. The costs of research and development projects are not estimated on a project by project basis. An analysis of costs between projects may only be performed on an arbitrary and subjective basis. 39 Trend Information The Company expects to consume cash and incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company’s subsidiary MEI intends to continue its expenditure on the development of its oncology drug candidates. The impact on cash resources and results from operations will vary with the extent and timing of the future clinical trial program. It is not possible to make accurate predictions of future operating results particularly in light of the potential capital reduction and in specie distribution transactions currently awaiting shareholder approval. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Compensation Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration Remuneration philosophy Remuneration is assessed for Directors and senior executives with the overall objective of ensuring maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention of a high quality executive team. The appropriateness and nature of remuneration is assessed by reference to employment market conditions. The financial and non-financial objectives of the Company are also considered when assessing the remuneration of Directors and other key management personnel. The Board has a Remuneration Committee which is responsible for determining and reviewing compensation arrangements for the key management personnel. Director’s fees The Constitution of the Company and the ASX Listing Rules specify that the aggregate remuneration of Non-executive Directors shall be determined from time to time by General Meeting. The last determination for Novogen Limited was at the Annual General Meeting held on October 28, 2005 when the shareholders approved an aggregate remuneration of A$560,000. The total Non-executive Director remuneration of Novogen Limited, including share based payments, for the year ended June 30, 2012 utilised A$345,000, (2011: A$415,000) of this authorised amount. The amount of aggregate remuneration sought to be approved by shareholders and the manner in which it is apportioned amongst Directors is reviewed periodically. Non-executive Director remuneration Fees to Non-executive Directors reflect the demands which are made on, and the responsibilities of the Directors. Non-executive Directors’ fees are reviewed periodically by the Board. In conducting these reviews the Board considers independent remuneration surveys to ensure Non-executive Directors’ fees are appropriate and in line with the market. Each Non-executive Director receives a fee for being a Director of the Company. An additional fee is also paid for each Board committee on which a Director sits. The payment of additional fees for serving on a committee recognises the additional time commitment required by Non-executive Directors who serve on one or more committees. 44 Due to the impact of the global financial crisis and the need for the Company to conserve cash, the Company’s Non-executive Directors voluntarily reduced Director’s fees by 20% with effect from February 1, 2009, this reduction was maintained for the year ended June 30, 2012. Executive Directors and other key management personnel remuneration The Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for determining and reviewing compensation arrangements for the key management personnel. The Remuneration Committee assesses the appropriateness of the nature and amount of remuneration of such Officers on a periodic basis by reference to relevant employment market conditions with the overall objective of ensuring maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention of a high quality executive team. Such officers are given the opportunity to receive their base remuneration, which is structured as a total employment cost package, in a variety of forms including cash and prescribed non-financial benefits. It is intended that the manner of payment chosen will be optimal for the recipient without creating undue cost for the Group. Employment Agreements Novogen Executive Directors and key management executives (standard contracts) It is the Remuneration Committee policy that employment contracts are entered into with each of the executives who are considered key management personnel. Under the terms of the agreement remuneration is reviewed annually and any increases may be made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Key management executives are given the opportunity to receive their base remuneration, which is structured as a total employment cost package, in a variety of forms including cash and prescribed non financial benefits. The employment agreement with the Chief Financial Officer continues until terminated by either party by giving six months notice in accordance with the terms of their contract or in the case of the Company by making a payment in lieu of six months notice to the employee. In the event of the Company terminating without cause, under the terms of the contract the amount payable on termination is equal to 6 months remuneration, in addition to any amount payable in lieu of notice. The Company may terminate the contracts at any time without cause if serious misconduct has occurred. MEI Pharma, Inc. – Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Contracts MEI Pharma, Inc.

Share Based Compensation Employee share option plan The Company established an Employee Share Option Plan which was approved by shareholders in October, 2007. The employee Share Option Plan provides for the issue of options to eligible employees being an employee or Director of the Company or related company. The number and timing of options issued under the terms of the Employee Share Option Plan is entirely at the discretion of the Board. Each option issued under the Employee Share Option Plan entitles its holder to acquire one fully paid ordinary share and is exercisable at a price generally equal to the weighted average price of such shares at the close of trading on the Australian Stock Exchange Limited for the five days prior to the date of issue. Options generally vest equally over a four year period from the date of grant and expire five years after grant date. No performance conditions apply to the options granted, however, the unvested option lapses if the employee ceases to be an employee during the vesting period. Options are not transferable and can not be settled by the Company in cash. The Employee Share Option Plan provides that in the event of a change of control of the Company or in the event that the Company is taken over, outstanding options become exercisable regardless of vesting status. Remuneration options: granted and vested during the year During the financial year no options were granted, by Novogen Limited, under the Employee Share Option Plan. There were no alterations to the terms and conditions of options granted as remuneration since their grant date. There is no Board policy in relation to staff members limiting their exposure to risk as options vest subject to service criteria, not performance criteria. The following table sets out options issued by MEI to Directors and key management personnel during the year: Terms and conditions for each grant Granted number Grant date Value per option Exercise price at grant date per share First exercise date Last exercise date (US$) (US$) Non-executive Directors WD Rueckert 25,169 20/10/2011 1.18 1.34 20/10/2012 20/10/2016 Executives DP Gold 100,000 1/08/2011 1.66 1.90 1/08/2012 1/08/2016 TM Zech 26,537 1/08/2011 1.66 1.90 1/08/2012 1/08/2016 Total 151,706 Under the terms of the options issued by MEI, 25% will vest one year from grant date and, thereafter, the remaining 75% of options will vest in equal monthly instalments over the following thirty-six (36) months. The options do not have any performance conditions. There were no options forfeited and all options granted are available for future years. 47 Shares issued on exercise of remuneration options No key management personnel or executives exercised options during the year ended June 30, 2012. Shares lapsed The value of options for key management personnel, which lapsed during the year ended June 30, 2012, was nil. Fair values of options: The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants made on: Novogen 6 May, 2011 Exercise price A$0.297 Share price at grant date A$0.24 Dividend yield 0% Expected volatility 125% Historical volatility 125% Risk-free interest rate 5.20% Expected life of option 3.7 years Option fair value A$0.19 MEI Pharma, Inc. 1 June, 2012 20 October, 2011 1 September, 2011 1 August, 2011 1 June, 2011 1 November, 2010 1 September, 2010 Exercise price US$0.61 US$1.34 US$1.53 US$1.90 US$1.28 US$1.15 US$0.77 Share price at grant date US$0.61 US$1.34 US$1.53 US$1.90 US$1.28 US$1.15 US$0.77 Dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % Expected volatility 152 % 148 % 147 % 145 % 144 % 137 % 136 % Historical volatility 152 % 148 % 147 % 145 % 144 % 137 % 136 % Risk-free interest rate 0.62 % 1.05 % 0.90 % 1.32 % 1.60 % 1.17 % 1.41 % Expected life of warrant/option 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Warrant/option fair value US$0.54 US$1.18 US$1.34 US$1.66 US$0.67 US$1.01 US$1.11 The dividend yield reflects the assumption that the current dividend payout, which is zero, will continue with no anticipated increases. The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. Further detail on the remuneration of Directors and Executives are also provided in Note 20 to the financial statements. Arrangements and Relationships There are no arrangements (other than standard employment remuneration arrangements) by which any Director or Executive Officer was appointed to his position. There are no family relationships between any of the Directors or Executive Officers. 48 No Director has received or has become entitled to receive, during or since the end of the fiscal year ended 2012, a benefit because of a contract made by Novogen Limited, a controlled entity, or a related body corporate with a Director, a firm of which a Director is a member or an entity in which a Director has a substantial financial interest. Pension Benefits The Company has paid A$90,000 during fiscal 2012 for employee superannuation benefits and pension benefits.

Austin Director 2010 October-2014 P.R. White Director 2010 October-2013 R.C. Youngman Director 2010 October-2013 J.P. O'Connor Director 2012 November-2012 Former Directors who served during the fiscal year 2012: P. Scutt Director 2010 Resigned May 25, 2012 Term of Directors The Company’s Constitution requires that at each Annual General Meeting of the Company, one third (or the number nearest to but not exceeding one third) of the Directors, (excluding a Director who is the Managing Director, and a Director appointed to fill a casual vacancy) must retire from office provided that no Director may retain office for more than 3 years without offering himself/herself for re-election even though such submission results in more than one third of the Directors retiring from office. The Board of Directors has the power to appoint any person to be a director either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director (up to a maximum of 10). Any Director so appointed may hold office only until the next Annual General Meeting when he or she shall be eligible for election by the Company shareholders. Board of Directors The Board of Directors of Novogen Limited is elected by and accountable to shareholders. The Board monitors and directs the business and is responsible for the corporate governance of the Company. The Board is comprised of five Directors all of whom are non-Executive Directors. In addition, the Board has established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee. 49 Structure of the Board of Directors The skills, expertise and experience relevant to the position of Director held by each Director in office at the date of this Annual Report is included in Item 6 beginning on page 41. Directors are considered to be independent when they are independent of management and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with, or could reasonably be perceived to materially interfere with, the exercise of their unfettered and independent judgement. In the context of Director independence, “materiality” is considered from both the Company and individual Director perspective. In determining whether a non-Executive Director is independent, he or she must not hold more than 5% of the Company’s outstanding shares. Also, the following qualitative factors, among others, are considered: · whether the director has been employed as an Executive of the Company within the last three years; · whether the director has been a principal of a material professional advisor or consultant of the Company; · whether the director has a material contractual relationship with the Company; · whether the director has served on the Board of Directors for a period which could be perceived to interfere with his or her ability to act in the best interests of the Company; and · whether the director has any business interests which could be perceived to interfere with his or her ability to act in the best interests of the Company. In accordance with the definition of independence above, and the materiality thresholds set, the following Directors of Novogen Limited are considered to be independent: Name Position William D Rueckert Non-Executive Director John P O’Connor Non-Executive Director Peter R White Non-Executive Director Ross C Youngman Non-Executive Director There are procedures in place, agreed upon by the Board of Directors, to enable Directors in the furtherance of their duties, to seek independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. For additional details regarding appointments to the Board of Directors please refer to the Company’s web site. Audit Committee The Board has an Audit Committee which comprises a majority of independent Non-executive Directors and operates under a charter approved by the Board. It is the Board’s responsibility to ensure that an effective internal control framework exists within the Group. This includes internal controls to deal with both the effectiveness and efficiency of significant business processes, the safeguarding of assets, the maintenance of proper accounting records and the reliability of financial information as well as non-financial considerations such as bench marking of operational key performance indicators. The Board has delegated the responsibility for the establishment and maintenance of a framework of internal control and ethical standards for the management of the Company to the Audit Committee. 50 The Audit Committee is responsible for the selection and appointment of the external auditor. The Audit Committee reviews the performance of the external auditor on an annual basis and meets with it to discuss audit planning matters and statutory reporting requirements. The Audit Committee also assesses whether non-audit services provided by the external auditor are consistent with maintaining auditor independence. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the auditor without management being present. The current external auditor, Grant Thornton Audit Pty Limited (“GT”) (previous auditors BDO Audit (NSW-VIC) Pty Ltd), attends the Annual General Meeting. The Audit Committee also provides the Board with additional assurance regarding the reliability of financial information for inclusion in the financial reports. The Board is of the view that the skill and experience of its members are sufficient to enable the Committee to discharge its responsibilities within its charter. The members of the Audit Committee during the year were Peter White (appointed Chairman January 18, 2012), Josiah Austin and William Rueckert (resigned as Chairman January 18, 2012). Performance The performance of the Board of Directors and the key Executives is reviewed regularly against both measurable and qualitative indicators. The performance criteria against which Directors and Executives are assessed have regard to the financial and non-financial objectives of Novogen Limited. Remuneration Committee Remuneration Committee. The Board has established a Remuneration Committee which is responsible for determining and reviewing compensation arrangements for the key management personnel. The Remuneration Committee operates in accordance with its charter which is available on the Company’s website. The Remuneration Committee comprises a majority of independent Non-executive Directors and has responsibility for reviewing and setting the remuneration of any Executive Directors and key management personnel by reference to independent data, external professional advice (as required) and the requirement to retain high quality management. Remuneration policies are established to attract and retain highly qualified Directors and senior management. The Remuneration Committee obtains independent advice on the appropriateness of remuneration levels.

Exemptions from Certain Corporate Governance Rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC Exemptions from the corporate governance standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”) are available to foreign private issuers such as Novogen when those standards are contrary to a law, rule or regulation of any public authority exercising jurisdiction over such issuer or contrary to generally accepted business practices in the issuer's country of domicile. In connection with Novogen's National Market Listing Application, Nasdaq granted Novogen exemptions from certain corporate governance standards that were contrary to the laws, rules, regulations or generally accepted business practices of Australia. These exemptions and the practices followed by Novogen are described below: · Novogen is exempt from Nasdaq's quorum requirements applicable to meetings of ordinary shareholders. In keeping with the law of Australia and generally accepted business practices in Australia, Novogen's Constitution requires a quorum of three shareholders for a shareholders' meeting. · Novogen is exempt from Nasdaq's requirement that each Nasdaq issuer shall require shareholder approval of a plan or arrangement in connection with the acquisition of the stock or assets of another company if "any director, officer or substantial shareholder of the issuer has a 5 percent or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10 percent or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the Company or assets to be acquired or in the consideration to be paid in the transaction or series of related transactions and the present or potential issuance of common stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5 percent or more". Novogen is listed on the ASX and subject to Chapter 10 of the ASX listing rules which requires shareholder approval for an acquisition from or disposal to a "related party" (including a director) or "substantial shareholder" (who is entitled to at least 10% of the voting securities) of "substantial assets".

Each share of Preferred Stock is convertible into 4,827 shares of MEI common stock for an aggregate of 4,827,000 shares, valued in total at US$4 million based on the volume weighted average price over the 20 trading days prior to the date of the execution of the asset purchase agreement.

Significant Changes After Balance Sheet Date Novogen Limited On July 27, 2012, Novogen announced that it had entered into a merger agreement with Kai Medical, a United States based company, incorporated in Delaware, whose business is focused on sleep apnea therapy devices and wireless respiration monitoring technology. The agreement was subject to a number of conditions including completion of due diligence and shareholder approval. On September 24, 2012 Novogen announced the termination of the merger agreement with Kai Medical following confirmation that the merged entity would not be able to maintain continued listing on the ASX (and Nasdaq markets). Under the terms of the merger agreement entered into by the companies, the merger agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect without any liability or obligation on the part of Novogen or Kai. Novogen plans to undertake a capital reduction and in specie distribution to the Novogen shareholders of the shares of MEI Pharma, Inc. (“MEI”) that it owns. This transaction is subject to shareholder approval. On 11 October 2012, Novogen announced that this transaction would be included in the items for shareholders to vote on at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 12 November, 2012. This distribution will allow Novogen shareholders to directly own their proportionate share of the MEI’s shares now held by Novogen. 56 The glucan technology assets, previously being developed by Glycotex, Inc., were not going to be acquired by Kai Medical in the proposed merger and Novogen completed a sale of those assets to TR Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held US corporation, on August 16, 2012. Following the planned in specie distribution of shares held by Novogen Limited, the Company will have no active operations and limited financial resources. The Company is currently exploring various strategic alternatives involving assets comprising substantially all of its business. MEI Pharma, Inc. On August 9, 2012, MEI announced that it had entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with S*BIO Pte Ltd, pursuant to which MEI will acquire S*BIO’s exclusive worldwide rights to Pracinostat, an investigational, potential best-in-class, based on improved physicochemical, pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic properties when compared to other compounds in its class of oral histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Pracinostat is an orally available, selective HDAC inhibitor that has demonstrated clinical study evidence of single-agent activity, including studies in patients with advanced hematologic disorders such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelofibrosis. In addition, Pracinostat has demonstrated pharmacokinetic properties in the clinic, including increased bioavailability and increased half-life that compare favorably to other compounds of this class. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, MEI will issue US$500,000 of common stock to S*BIO. The agreement also includes potential success-based clinical, regulatory and sales milestone payments of up to US$75.2 million, as well as low single-digit contingent earn-out payments based on net sales. On August 22, 2012, MEI completed the asset purchase and issued 1,174,536 shares of common stock to S*Bio Pte Ltd.
