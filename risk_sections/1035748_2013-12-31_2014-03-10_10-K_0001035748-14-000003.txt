Item 1A. Risk FactorsFactors That Could Affect Future ResultsWe operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSWe have a history of losses, and we cannot assure you that we will return to or maintain non-GAAP profitability.We incurred net losses of $21.4 million in 2013, $27.7 million in 2012, and $15.8 million in 2011. To achieve profitability, we must further increase our total revenue, principally by growing our recurring revenue offerings by entering into more and/or larger transactions, maintaining or reducing the rate of existing customer cancellations, and ensuring that our cost structure is aligned with our recurring revenue model. If we cannot increase our recurring revenue and manage costs, our future results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected and we may be unable to continue operating.We continue to monitor and manage our costs in an effort to further optimize our performance for the long-term. However, there is no assurance that these steps will be adequate, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties or delays may prevent us from realizing our goals. We 5Table of Contentsmay need to incur restructuring expenses or implement other cost reduction efforts in the future and, even with these or any future actions, we cannot be sure that we will achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. In addition, we cannot be certain the steps we have taken to control our costs in the near term will not adversely affect our prospects for long-term revenue growth. If we cannot increase our total revenue, continue to improve our gross margins, and control our costs, our future operating results and financial condition will be negatively affected. A majority of our revenue are derived from a single solution in 2013, and a decline in sales of that solution could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.We derive, and expect to continue to derive, majority of our product revenue from a single solution, and are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for that solution. If demand for that solution declines significantly and we can’t replace the revenue with revenue from our other offerings, our business and operating results will be adversely affected as our financial performance and business outlook depends on continued market acceptance of that solution. We cannot ensure that our current levels of market penetration and revenue will continue in the future. If market conditions or increased competition result in customer cancellations or reductions in our subscription service, or if we are unable to successfully introduce new solutions or keep pace with technological advancements, our revenue may decline.Our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future, harming our results of operations, and because we recognize revenue from subscriptions over a period of time, downturns or upturns in revenue may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.Because we generally recognize SaaS revenue and maintenance revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription and maintenance support agreements, most of the revenue we report in each quarter result from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions and maintenance in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in revenue for that quarter but will harm our revenue in future quarters. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our operating costs and capital expenditures to reflect the changes in revenue. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales of our SaaS offerings and increases in customer attrition may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our on-demand subscription model also makes it more difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. In addition, although our revenue is primarily focused on recurring revenue, we anticipate continuing to recognize perpetual license revenue, particularly with international customers. Perpetual license revenue is difficult to forecast and is likely to fluctuate, sometimes significantly, from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are wholly or partially beyond our control. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as definitive indicators of future performance. Other factors that may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate include:•the discretionary nature of customer spending levels and budget cycles as well as the priority our customers place on our products compared to other business investments;•varying size, timing and contractual terms of orders for our products, which may delay the recognition of revenue;•competitive factors, including new product introductions, upgrades and discounted pricing or special payment terms offered by our competitors;•technical difficulties, errors or interruptions in our solutions which may result in customer dissatisfaction with our products and services;•pricing changes and general economic conditions, including the ongoing after-effects of the global economic crisis;•unpredictable and often lengthy sales cycles;•strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;•consolidation among our customers, which may alter their buying patterns, or business failures that may reduce demand for our products and services;•increased operating expenses associated with expansion of our sales force or business, and increased product development efforts;•extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other payments related to settlement of disputes; and•cost, timing and management effort related to the introduction of new features to our solutions.With respect to general economic conditions, our business may be adversely impacted by: (i) reduced bookings and revenue, as a result of longer sales cycles, reduced, deferred or cancelled customer purchases, and lower average selling prices; (ii) increased operating losses and reduced cash flows from operations; (iii) greater than anticipated uncollectible accounts receivable and increased allowances for 6Table of Contentsdoubtful accounts receivable; and (iv) impairment in the value of our financial and non-financial assets resulting in non-cash impairment charges. Any of these developments, or the combination thereof, may adversely affect our revenue, operating results and financial condition in future periods. Furthermore, we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In such cases, we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. In the future, we may have to record additional reserves or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results.Interruption of our operations, infrastructure or systems upon which we rely could prevent us from delivering our products and services to our customers, which could significantly harm our business.Our business is primarily conducted over the Internet and, therefore, it depends on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our computer equipment, offices and hosting facilities against damage from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion and other events. There can be no assurance that our disaster preparedness will prevent significant interruption of our operations. Interruptions in the services provided by these facilities may result in unexpected and possibly lengthy service interruptions. Any service interruptions, regardless of the cause, may result in material liability claims against us for breach of service-level commitments to our customers, customer terminations and damage to our reputation.In addition, we engage third-party service providers for our hosting facilities and related infrastructure that is essential for our subscription services. Our service to customers could be interrupted in the event of a natural disaster, by a hosting provider decision to close a facility or terminate operations or by other unanticipated problems. Similarly, we use third-party telecommunications providers for Internet and other telecommunication services. We also rely heavily on our own and third-party financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. Any of these third-party providers may fail to perform their obligations adequately, and any of these third-party systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled for varying periods of time, causing business interruption or system damage, which could reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions, cause other liability to customers, or cause regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation.Errors or interruptions in our solutions could be costly to correct and time consuming to repair, and adversely affect our reputation and impair our ability to sell our solutions.Our solutions are complex and, accordingly, they may contain errors, or "bugs." Any errors or vulnerabilities could be extremely costly to correct, materially and adversely affect our reputation and impair our ability to sell our solutions. Moreover, customers relying on our solutions to calculate and pay incentive compensation may have a greater sensitivity to errors, security vulnerabilities and interruptions than in other applications. If we incur substantial costs to correct any errors or repair availability issues, our operating margins will be adversely affected. Because our customers depend on our solutions for their critical business functions, any interruptions could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our solutions, product liability suits against us, diversion of development resources and substantially greater service-level credits and warranty costs than anticipated or accrued. Further, our efforts to reduce costs by employing more subcontracting personnel to perform product development, technical support, professional services and application hosting tasks may make it more difficult for us to timely respond to errors or interruptions.Companies and solutions added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities. Despite precautions taken at these facilities or by us, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service and damage our reputation.If we are unable to maintain the profitability of our recurring revenue products and services, our operating results could be adversely affected.We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, substantial resources to expand, market and refine our recurring revenue products and services offerings. If we are unable to continue increasing the volume of our on-demand business or improving gross margins, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability and our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. Factors that could harm our ability to improve our gross margins include:•significant attrition as customers decide not to renew for their own economic or other reasons;•our inability to maintain or increase the prices customers pay for our products and services based on competitive pricing pressures and limited customer demand;•increased cost of third-party services providers, including hosting facilities for our SaaS operations and professional services contractors performing implementation and technical support services as well as inefficiencies, delays and unacceptable quality from such vendors;•increased costs that relate to integration of acquired products or personnel;•increased cost to license and maintain third-party software embedded in our solution or the cost to create or substitute such third-7Table of Contentsparty software if it can no longer be licensed on commercially reasonable terms;•the inability to implement, or delays in implementing, technology-based efficiencies and efforts to streamline and consolidate processes to reduce operating costs; and•higher wage and benefits costs for our existing personnel or the need to increase the number of our employees to support increasing customer demands for our professional services, technical support or general operations.Breaches of security or failure to safeguard customer data could create the perception that our products and services are not secure, causing customers to discontinue or reject the use of our products or services and potentially subject us to significant liability. Implementing, monitoring and maintaining adequate security safeguards may be costly.Our on-demand service allows customers to access our solutions and transmit confidential data, including personally identifiable individual data of their employees, agents and customers over the Internet. We also store data provided to us by our customers on servers in our hosting facilities. In addition, we may have access to confidential and private individual data as part of our professional services organization activities, including implementation, maintenance and support of our software for term and perpetual license customers.Moreover, many of our customers are subject to heightened security obligations regarding the personally identifiable information of their downstream customers. In the United States, these heightened obligations particularly affect the financial services, healthcare and insurance sectors, which are subject to stringent controls over personal information under various state and federal laws and regulations. In addition, the European Union Directive on Data Protection as well as the laws and regulations of the Member States of the European Union implementing the directive create international obligations on the protection of personal data that typically exceed security requirements mandated in the United States. The security measures we have implemented and may need to implement, monitor and maintain in the future to satisfy the requirements of our customers may be substantial and involve significant time and effort, which are typically not chargeable to our customers.In addition, these security measures may be breached due to third-party action, including intentional misconduct or malfeasance, employee error or otherwise, and result in unauthorized disclosure of or access to our customers’ data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our IT systems. Third parties also may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers’ data or our data or IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data. Because we do not control our customers and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third-parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. If we do not adequately safeguard the information imported into our solutions or otherwise provided to us by our customers, or if third parties penetrate our systems or security and misappropriate our customers' confidential information, it may damage our reputation, result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business, and we may be sued and incur substantial damages in connection with such events. Even if it is determined that our security measures were adequate, the damage to our reputation may cause customers and potential customers to reconsider the use of our products and services, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Decreases in retention rates for customer on-demand subscription or on-premise maintenance arrangements could materially impact our future revenue or operating results.Our customers have no obligation to renew our on-demand service or maintenance support transactions after the expiration of the subscription or maintenance period, which is typically 12 to 24 months, and some customers have elected not to renew. Our customers may renew for fewer payees or renew for shorter contract lengths. In addition, we offer a pay-as-you-go model, whereby customers can pay for our on-demand service on a monthly basis without a long-term commitment, which may unexpectedly increase the rate of customer non-renewals and thus negatively and unpredictably affect our recurring revenue during a particular reporting period. Our customer retention rates, including the retention of customers gained from the addition of acquired products, may decline and we cannot accurately predict renewal rates. If our customers' renewal rates decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including reduced budgets, insourcing decisions, or dissatisfaction with our service, our revenue will be adversely affected and our business will suffer. If we do not compete effectively, our revenue may not grow and could decline.We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition from a number of software companies and internally-developed solutions as the market for sales effectiveness products is rapidly evolving. We believe one of our key challenges is to be able to demonstrate the benefit of our products and services to prospective customers such that they place purchases of our products and services at a higher priority relative to other projects. Our financial performance depends in large part on continued growth in the number of organizations adopting sales effectiveness and other related solutions to manage the performance of their sales organizations. The market for sales effectiveness solutions may not develop as we expect, or at all. Moreover, our competitors may be more successful than we are in capturing the market. In either case, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.8Table of ContentsWe compete principally with vendors of sales effectiveness software, Enterprise Incentive Management ("EIM") software, enterprise resource planning software and customer relationship management software. Our competitors may announce new products, services or enhancements that better meet the needs of prospects, customers and/or changing industry standards. Increased competition may cause price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Many of our enterprise resource planning competitors and other potential competitors have longer operating histories with significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources. Many also have a larger installed base of users, larger marketing budgets and relationships, established distribution agreements, and greater name recognition. Some of our competitors' products may also be more effective at performing particular sales effectiveness or EIM system functions or may be more customized for particular customer needs in a given market. Even if our competitors provide products with less sales performance management or EIM system functionality than our products, their products may incorporate other capabilities, such as recording and accounting for transactions, customer orders or inventory management data. A product that performs these functions, as well as some of the functions of our solutions, may be appealing to some customers because it would reduce the number of applications used to run their business.Our products generally must be integrated with software provided by existing or potential competitors. These competitors could alter their products in ways that inhibit integration with ours, or they could deny or delay our access to advance software releases, which would restrict our ability to adapt our products for integration with their new releases and could result in the loss of both sales opportunities and renewals of on-demand services and maintenance.In addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Increased competition may cause price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share.Some potential customers have already made substantial investments in third-party or internally developed solutions designed to model, administer, analyze and report on pay-for-performance programs. These companies may be reluctant to abandon such investments in favor of our products and services. In addition, information technology departments of potential customers may resist purchasing our solutions for a variety of reasons, particularly the potential displacement of their historical role in creating and running software and concerns that packaged and hosted product offerings are not sufficiently customizable and/or pose data security concerns for their enterprises.The use and adoption of our solutions may be limited by privacy concerns and laws, including cross-border data transfers and other domestic or foreign regulations which could have an adverse effect on our future revenue or operating results. We expect federal, state and foreign governments to continue to increase regulation of Internet commerce, including data privacy. The laws and regulations that relate to the solicitation, collection, processing, use, and disclosure of personal information, as well as those that apply to cross-border transfers of personal information, could affect demand for our solutions. For example, our customers can use our service to store compensation and other personal or identifying information about their sales personnel.The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to our customers’ businesses may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws. As a result, certain industries may not adopt our services based on perceived privacy concerns, regardless of the validity of such concerns. The transfer of our on demand infrastructure may result in interruptions to service or other difficulties which may negatively impact our customers.We deliver our solutions by using an integrated architecture environment, which has previously been provided through third-party facilities. We are in the process of transitioning to a new third-party facility with full redundancy capabilities in Sacramento, California to support our SaaS solutions. We intend to establish a second, fully redundant hosting facility in Virginia in 2014. Our systems, procedures or controls might not be adequate to support this functionality. Further, these functions are complex and disruptions to the environment could occur during the transfer of customers to the new data center, which may result in increased exposure to remediation efforts and liability claims against us for breach of service-level commitments, customer terminations and damage to our reputation and future business prospects.Acquisitions and investments present many risks. We may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic benefits of such transactions, and may not be able to successfully integrate and manage the acquired businesses. In addition, we may not be able to manage our operations with the acquired businesses efficiently or profitably.As part of our business strategy, we evaluate opportunities to expand and enhance our product and services offerings to meet our customers' needs, increase our market opportunities and grow revenue, both through internal development efforts and external acquisitions and partnerships. We have completed a number of acquisitions since 2010, and we may continue to acquire or make investments in other companies, products, services and technologies in the future. Acquisitions and investments may cause disruptions in or add complexity to our operations and involve a number of risks, including the following:9Table of Contents•the benefits that we anticipated from an acquisition, such as an increase in revenue, may not materialize if, for example, a larger number of customers than expected choose not to renew or if we are not able to cross-sell the acquired company's products and services to our existing customer base;•we may have difficulty integrating and managing the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines, and in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies across locations;•we may experience challenges in, and have difficulty penetrating, new markets where we have little or no prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions;•we may have difficulty integrating the financial systems and personnel of the acquired business and in retaining the key employees, and to the extent we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock, including options, to such individuals, existing stockholders may be diluted;•our ongoing business and management's attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of overseeing geographically and culturally diverse locations;•we may find that the acquired business or assets do not further our business strategy, or that we overpaid for the business or assets, or that we do not realize the expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits;•we may fail to uncover or realize the significance of, or otherwise become exposed to, certain liabilities and other issues assumed from an acquired business, such as claims from terminated employees or third-parties and unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting practices;•we may experience customer confusion as a result of product overlap, particularly when we offer, price and support various product lines differently and/or on varying contractual terms;•our use of cash consideration for one or more significant acquisitions may require us to use a substantial portion of our available cash or incur substantial debt, and if we incur substantial debt, it could result in material limitations on the conduct of our business.These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or cash flows. Furthermore, during periods of operational expansion, we often need to expand the size of our staff, grow and manage our related operations and third-party partnerships, and potentially amplify our financial and accounting controls to ensure they remain effective. Such changes may increase our expenses, and there is no assurance that our infrastructure will be sufficiently scalable to efficiently manage any growth that we may experience. If we are unable to leverage our operating cost investments as a percentage of revenue, our ability to generate or increase profits will be adversely impacted. In addition, from time to time, we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions investments that are not ultimately consummated, which could result in significant diversion of management time, as well as out-of-pocket expenses. Some of our products rely on third-party software licenses to operate, and the loss or inability to maintain these licenses and/or errors, discontinuations, or updates in or to such software, could result in increased costs, delayed sales, or customer claims against, or termination of, our existing agreements.We license technology from several software providers for our reporting, analytics, and integration applications, and we anticipate that we may continue to license some of these technologies from these or other providers in connection with future products. We also rely on generally available third-party software to run our applications. Any of these software applications may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or new versions may be released that are incompatible with our offerings. Some of the products could be difficult to replace, and developing or integrating new software with our products could require months or years of design and engineering work. The loss or modification of any of these technologies could result in delays in providing our products until equivalent technology is developed or, if available, is identified, licensed and integrated. Acquisitions of third-party technologies by other companies, including our competitors, may have a material adverse impact on us if the acquirer seeks to cancel or change the terms of our license.In addition, we depend upon the successful operation of certain third-party products in conjunction with our products or services. As a result, undetected errors in these products could prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products, delay new product introductions, limit the availability of our products via our on-demand service, and/or injure our reputation. Our use of additional or alternative third-party products could result in new or higher royalty payments if we are required to enter into license agreements for such products.Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services and enhance our existing products and services rapidly and cost-effectively. Failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products and services may adversely affect our operating results.SaaS sales effectiveness solutions and cloud computing markets are generally characterized by:•rapid technological advances;•changing customer needs; and10Table of Contents•frequent new product introductions and enhancements.To keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements, achieve market acceptance and effectively respond to competition, we must quickly identify emerging trends and requirements, accurately define and design enhancements and improvements for existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that satisfy our customers’ changing demands. Accelerated introductions for products and services require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results. Further, any new products or services we develop may not be introduced in a timely manner or be available in a distribution model acceptable to our target markets, and may therefore not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If we are unable to quickly and successfully develop or acquire and distribute new products and services cost-effectively, or enhance existing products and services, or if we fail to position and price our products and services to meet market demand, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.Our offshore product development, support and professional services may prove difficult to manage or of inadequate quality to allow us to realize our cost reduction goals and produce new products and services and provide professional services to drive growth.Our use of offshore resources to perform new product and services development, and provide support and professional consulting efforts has required, and will continue to require, detailed technical and logistical coordination. We must ensure that international resources are aware of and understand development specifications and customer support, as well as implementation and configuration requirements and that they can meet applicable timelines or, if they are not met, that any delays are not significant. We may not be able to maintain acceptable standards of quality in support, product development and professional services. If we are unable to successfully maintain the quality of services provided by our international third-party service providers, our attempts to reduce costs and drive growth through new products and margin improvements in technical support and professional services may be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Outsourcing services to offshore providers may expose us to misappropriation of our intellectual property or that of our customers, or make it more difficult to defend our rights in our technology. The loss of key personnel, higher than normal employee attrition in key departments, or the inability of replacements to quickly and successfully perform in their new roles could adversely affect our business.Our success depends to a significant extent on the abilities and effectiveness of our personnel, and, in particular, our chief executive officer and other executive officers. All of our existing personnel, including our executive officers, are employed on an "at-will" basis. If we lose or terminate the services of one or more of our current executives or key employees or if one or more of our current or former executives or key employees joins a competitor or otherwise competes with us, or if we do not have an effective succession or development plan in place for such individuals, our ability to successfully implement our business plan could be impaired. Likewise, if a number of employees from specific departments were to depart, our short-term ability to maintain business may be adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to quickly hire qualified replacements for our executives, other key positions or employees within specific departments, our ability to execute our business plan could be harmed. Even if we can quickly hire qualified replacements, we would expect to experience operational disruptions and inefficiencies during any transition.If we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees and contractors, including sales, professional services, and engineering personnel, our growth may be impaired.To scale our business successfully, increase productivity, maintain a high level of quality and meet the needs of our customers, we need to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled employees and subcontractors in all areas of our business, including sales, professional services and engineering. In particular, if we are unable to hire or subcontract for and retain talented personnel with the skills, and in the locations, we require, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs. Furthermore, we intend to continue increasing our sales force and, if we are not successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, or if new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels within a reasonable time period, we may not be able to increase our revenue and realize the anticipated benefits of these investments.As our customer base increases and as we continue to evaluate and modify our organizational structure to increase efficiency, we are likely to experience staffing constraints in connection with the deployment of trained and experienced professional services and support resources capable of implementing, configuring, maintaining and supporting our products and related services. Moreover, as a company focused on the development of complex products and the provision of online services, we are often in need of additional software developers and engineers. We have relied on our ability to grant equity compensation as one mechanism for recruiting, retaining and motivating such highly skilled personnel. Our ability to provide equity compensation depends, in part, upon receiving stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans. If we are not able to secure such approval from our stockholders, our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our personnel may be adversely impacted, which would negatively impact our operating results.11Table of ContentsIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock may be negatively affected.We are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Effective planning and management processes are necessary to meet these requirements, and we expect that we will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls to manage our business effectively in the future. We are also required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.If we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property, we may lose valuable assets, experience reduced revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.Our success and ability to compete is dependent on the proprietary technology embedded in our products and services. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, contractual provisions and other similar measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We cannot protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect its unauthorized use. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy and/or reverse engineer our products and services and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. The provisions in our license agreements prohibiting unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our licensed programs and services may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent that we engage in international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products, services and proprietary information increases.We enter into confidentiality and license agreements, as applicable, with our employees and consultants and with customers and third parties with whom we have strategic relationships. We cannot ensure that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products, services and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products and services. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our trade secrets. Litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could seriously harm our business.Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are subject to a protracted infringement claim or one that results in a significant damage award.From time to time, we receive claims that our products, services offerings or business infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of third parties, including the ongoing suit brought against us by Versata Software, Inc. and Versata Development Group, Inc. and our competitors or other third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights. In addition, we have in the past and may continue in the future to assert claims of infringement against third parties on such bases, including the case we brought and ultimately settled in 2013 that involved Xactly Corporation and its President and Chief Executive Officer. For more information, see "Item 3. Legal Proceedings". We believe that claims of infringement are likely to increase as the functionality of our products and services expand and we introduce new products and services. Claims may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties. Any infringement claim, whether offensive or defensive, could:•require costly litigation to resolve;•absorb significant management time;•cause us to enter into unfavorable royalty or license agreements;•require us to discontinue the sale of all or a portion of our products or services;•require us to indemnify our customers and/or third-party service providers; and/or•require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our products or services.Inclusion of open source software in our products may expose us to liability or require release of our source code.We currently use a limited amount of open source software in our products and may use more in the future. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software that has been incorporated into our products. In addition, some open source software is provided under licenses that require that proprietary software, when combined in specific ways with open source software, become subject to the open source license and thus freely available. While we take steps to minimize the risk that our products, when incorporating open source software, would become subject to open source licenses, few courts have interpreted open source 12Table of Contentslicenses. As a result, the enforcement of these licenses is unclear. If our products were to become subject to open source licenses, our ability to commercialize our products and services and consequently, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected.Sales to customers in international markets pose risks and challenges for which we may not achieve the expected results.We continue to invest substantial time and resources to grow our international operations. If we fail to do so successfully, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. Such expansion may require substantial financial resources and a significant amount of attention from our management. International operations involve a variety of risks, particularly:•greater difficulty in supporting and localizing our products and services;•compliance with numerous regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws and tariffs that may conflict and/or change unexpectedly, including labor, tax, privacy and data protection;•use of international resellers and compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;•greater difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations;•greater difficulty in maintaining acceptable standards of quality in support, product development and professional services by our international third-party service providers;•differing abilities to protect our intellectual property rights;•possible political and economic instability; and•fluctuating exchange rates.Our services revenue produce substantially lower gross margins than our recurring and license revenue, and periodic variations in the proportional relationship between services revenue and higher margin recurring and license revenue have harmed, and may continue to harm, our overall gross margins.Our services revenue, which include fees for consulting, implementation and training, represented 20% of our revenue in 2013. Our services revenue have substantially lower gross margins than our recurring and license revenue.Historically, services revenue as a percentage of total revenue have varied significantly from period to period due to a number of circumstances including fluctuations in licensing and, to a lesser extent, recurring revenue, changes in the average selling prices for our products and services, and the effectiveness and appeal of competitive service providers. More recently, the extent of the fluctuations has diminished, primarily due to decreased need for consulting services in light of fewer perpetual license transactions. However, while the fluctuation in the percentage of services revenue as compared to total revenue has moderated on a quarterly basis, we continue to expect wider variability in services revenue itself from quarter-to-quarter, principally as the number of new recurring revenue customer transactions varies from quarter to quarter.In addition, the volume and profitability of services can depend in large part upon:•competitive pricing pressure for professional services;•increases or decreases in the number of services projects being performed on a fixed bid or acceptance basis that may defer recognition of revenue;•the priority and resources customers place on implementation projects;•the timing of milestone acceptance contracts;•the timing and amount of any remediation services related to professional services warranty claims;•the complexity of the customers' information technology environments; and•the extent to which outside consulting organizations provide services directly to customers.Deployment of certain products and services may require substantial technical implementation and support by us or third-party service providers. We may lose sales opportunities and our business may be harmed if we do not successfully meet these requirements and/or develop and maintain strategic relationships to implement and sell our products and services, which may cause a decline or delay in revenue recognition and an increase in our expenses.13Table of ContentsCertain products and services we deploy may require a substantial degree of technical and logistical expertise. Moreover, some of our customers require large, enterprise-wide deployments. It may be difficult for us to manage these deployments, including the timely allocation of personnel and resources by us and our customers. Failure to successfully manage the process could harm our reputation both generally and with specific customers and may cause us to lose existing customers, face potential customer disputes or reduce the number of new customers that purchase our products, each of which could adversely affect our revenue and increase our technical support and litigation costs. If actual remediation services exceed our accrued estimates, we could be required to take additional charges, which could be material.We have relationships with third-party partners, systems integrators and software vendors. These third parties may provide customer referrals, cooperate with us in the design, sales and/or marketing of our products and services, provide valuable insights into market demands, and provide our customers with systems implementation services or overall program management. However, in some cases we may not have formal agreements governing our ongoing relationship with certain of these third-party providers and the agreements we do have generally do not include specific obligations with respect to generating sales opportunities or cooperating on future business.We also, from time to time, consider strategic relationships that are new or unusual for us and which can pose additional risks. For example, while reseller arrangements offer the advantage of leveraging larger sales organizations than our own to sell our products, they also require considerable time and effort on our part to train and support the reseller's personnel, and require the reseller to properly motivate and incentivize its sales force. Also, if we enter into an exclusive reseller arrangement, the exclusivity may prevent us from pursuing the applicable market ourselves; if the reseller is not successful in the particular location, our results of operations may be adversely affected.Should any of these third-parties go out of business, perform unsatisfactory services or choose not to work with us, we may be forced to develop new capabilities internally, which may cause significant delays and expense, thereby adversely affecting our operating results. These third-party providers may offer products of other companies, including products and services that compete with ours. If we do not successfully or efficiently establish, maintain and expand our industry relationships with influential market participants, we could lose sales and service opportunities, which would adversely affect our results of operations.If we change prices, alter our payment terms or modify our products or services in order to compete successfully, our margins and operating results may be adversely affected.The intensely competitive market in which we do business may require us to change our prices and/or modify our pricing strategies in ways that may adversely affect our operating results. If our competitors offer deep discounts on competitive products or services, we may need to lower prices or offer other terms more favorable to existing and prospective customers in order to compete successfully. Alternatively, if we choose to raise prices based upon our own evaluation of the value of our products, such increases may not be well received by customers, which may impact our sales volumes. Some of our competitors may bundle their products with their other products and services for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy, or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time, limit the prices that we can charge for our products or services or cause us to modify our existing market strategies accordingly. If we cannot offset price reductions and other terms more favorable to our customers with a corresponding increase in sales or decrease in spending, then the reduced revenue resulting from lower prices would adversely affect our margins and operating results.Our products have unpredictable sales cycles, making it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results.It is difficult to determine how long the sales cycles for our solutions will be, thereby making it difficult to predict the quarter in which a particular sale will close and to plan expenditures accordingly. Moreover, to the extent that sales are completed in the final two weeks of a quarter, the impact of recurring revenue transactions is typically not reflected in our financial statements until subsequent quarters. In addition, the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and ultimate sale of our products and services is relatively long due to several factors, which may include:•the complex nature of some of our products;•the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our products and services;•budget cycles of our potential customers that affect the timing of purchases;•customer requirements for competitive evaluation and often lengthy internal approval processes (particularly of large organizations) before purchasing our products and services; and•potential delays of purchases due to announcements or planned introductions of new products and services by us or our competitors.The failure to complete sales of our on-demand solutions in a particular quarter will impact revenue in subsequent quarters as revenue from our on-demand services are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement.14Table of ContentsOur latest product features and functionality may require existing on-premise customers to migrate to our on-demand solution. Moreover, we may choose or be compelled to discontinue maintenance support for older versions of our software products, forcing our on-premise customers to upgrade their software in order to continue receiving maintenance support. If existing on-premise customers fail to migrate or delay migration to our on-demand solution, our revenue may be harmed.We continue to promote our on-demand product offerings to existing customers who currently have on-premise perpetual and term licenses. Customers with on-premise licenses may need to migrate to our on-demand solutions to take full advantage of the features and functionality in those products and services. We also expect to periodically terminate maintenance support on older versions of our on-premise products for various reasons including, without limitation, termination of support by third-party software vendors whose products complement ours or upon which we are dependent. Regardless of the reason, a migration is likely to involve additional cost, which our customers may delay or decline to incur. If a sufficient number of customers do not migrate to our on-demand product offerings, our continued maintenance support opportunities and our ability to sell additional products to these customers, and as a result, our revenue and operating income, may be harmed.We have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes. In 2011 we issued $80.5 million in aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes ("Convertible Notes") pursuant to an indenture between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. We repurchased $21.3 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes during 2011, and $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes was exchanged for 5.8 million shares of our common stock in 2013. We may be required to repurchase the remaining outstanding balance of $14.2 million at maturity in 2016, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes, as defined in the indenture. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. This indebtedness could, among other things: •make it difficult for us to pay other obligations;•make it difficult for us to obtain favorable terms for any necessary future financing and place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources;•require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness; •limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business; •limit our ability to sell ourselves or engage in other strategic transactions. The conversion of outstanding Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of common stock, and the holders of such Convertible Notes may covert at any time. Any public market sales of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of those notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. Any sales in the public market of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of such notes could adversely affect trading price of our common stock and the value of the notes.RISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCKOur stock price is likely to remain volatile.The trading price of our common stock has in the past, and may in the future, be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including those described in this section. We receive limited attention by securities analysts and we frequently experience an imbalance between supply and demand in the public trading market for our common stock due to limited trading volumes. Investors should consider an investment in our common stock as risky and should purchase our common stock only if they can withstand significant losses. Other factors that affect the volatility of our stock include:•our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;•significant sales or distributions by existing investors coupled with a lack of trading volume for our stock;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, results of operations, projections, new technologies, acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;•changes in our management team;•failure to meet published operating estimates or expectations of securities analysts and investors;•publication of research reports, particularly those that are inaccurate or unfavorable, about us or our industry by securities analysts; and•developments with respect to intellectual property rights.15Table of ContentsAdditionally, some companies with volatile market prices for their securities have been the subject of securities class action lawsuits. Any such suit could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and the price of our common stock.Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock, by us or our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock, including securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of our common stock, such as shares underlying our existing Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate, subject to adjustment upon certain events, of 129.6596 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $7.71 per share of our common stock).The issuance of additional shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes or other issuances of shares of our common stock or convertible securities, including outstanding options, restricted stock units and warrants, will dilute the ownership interest of our shareholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.In addition, sales by existing stockholders of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public trading market (or in private transactions), including sales by our executive officers, directors or institutional investors, or the perception that such additional sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to drop.We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.Provisions in our charter documents, Delaware law and the indenture may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company.Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third-party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. For example, if a potential acquirer were to make a hostile bid for us, the acquirer would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting. In addition, our board of directors has staggered terms, which means that replacing a majority of our directors would require at least two annual meetings. A potential acquirer would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to replace directors at any annual meeting, and would not be able to accumulate votes at a meeting, which would require such potential acquirer to hold more shares to gain representation on the board of directors than if cumulative voting were permitted. Furthermore, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law limits business combination transactions with 15% stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors. All of these factors make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us without negotiation. These provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. Our board of directors could choose not to negotiate with a potential acquirer that it does not believe is in our strategic interests. If a potential acquirer is discouraged from offering to acquire us or prevented from successfully completing a hostile acquisition by these or other measures, under certain circumstances, this could reduce the market price of our common stock.In addition, certain provisions of the Convertible Notes described above could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third-party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes with a principal amount equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. We may also be required, under certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes if a holder elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change as defined in the indenture.Item 1B.
