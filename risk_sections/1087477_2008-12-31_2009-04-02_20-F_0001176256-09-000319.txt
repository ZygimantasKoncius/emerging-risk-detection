D. Risk Factors We are subject to significant risks and past performance is no guarantee of future performance. The following offers a brief overview of some of the risk factors to be considered in relation to our business. This list of factors may not be exhaustive, as we operate in a rapidly changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. We cannot predict such risk factors, nor can the impact, if any, be assessed of such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements or information. Accordingly, forward-looking statements or information should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. The following summarizes what we believe are the major risks and uncertainties we currently face: General Corporate Risks Need for Additional Funds / M&A Transaction We will need to obtain additional financing, or a suitable merger, acquisition or other strategic combination transaction (an M&A transaction), by the end of 2009 in order to carry on our business as a going concern. We believe our capital resources are adequate to fund operations into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This belief is based on a number of factors and assumptions, and include the assumption that our expenditures will not exceed those currently planned, that we will receive the $800,000 Additional Funding as anticipated, that there will be no material change to our relationships with our four largest customers, and our revenues for 2009 will meet or exceed our expectations. There can be no assurance that such assumptions and factors will be realized or met. In order to continue operations through and beyond the f ourth quarter of 2009, and to minimize risks to our operations in the meantime should any of our assumptions fail to be realized, we will need to undertake a suitable M&A transaction, or obtain additional financing. We have no external sources of liquidity such as lines of credit (excluding the line of credit in Forbes-Fayrefield, which is restricted to use by that entity). While management is considering all financing alternatives and is seeking to raise additional funds for operations from potential investors, there is no assurance that such funding will be available or obtained on favorable terms. The market for both debt and equity financings for companies such as ours has always been challenging. We are also continuing to focus our efforts on obtaining a suitable M&A transaction. Our future operations are completely dependent upon our ability to complete a suitable M&A transaction and/or secure additional funds. If we cannot complete one or more of these, we wil l have to consider additional strategic alternatives which may include, among other strategies, exploring the monetization of certain intangible assets as well as seeking to out-license assets, potential asset divestitures, winding up, dissolution or liquidation. The above matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue to operate as currently structured. 4 Going Concern Our financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will continue in operation throughout 2009 and into the foreseeable future and will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recovery of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. The Report Of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm attached contains a going concern emphasis paragraph. We have a History of Losses We have a history of losses, including a net loss from continuing operations of $7,190,000 for the financial year ended 2008. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $9,242,000, for the financial year ended 2006, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $11,001,000. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses during fiscal 2009 and that we will not reach profitability until further successful and profitable commercialization of our products, which is not assured. Even if we do reach profitability, the initial losses incurred by us may never be recovered. Future Revenues and Profitability are Uncertain Our financial results may fluctuate, and our future revenue and profitability are uncertain. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability in the foreseeable future depends on our ability to increase sales of our products and control costs. Because the majority of our sales are of a nutraceutical ingredient, we need to work with potential customers in their development of their own new product to include our ingredient. There can be no assurance that our product development work with potential customers will reach the stage of successful development and launch of new products or that any such products will achieve market acceptance. Our future revenue is also dependent upon fulfillment of contractual obligations by third parties, including fulfilling payment terms and meeting forecasted purchase requirements by buyers of our products and assets. There can be no assurance that our revenue expectations for the current fiscal year will be achieved. Global Economic Downturn The current credit crisis and general global economic downturn may have a negative effect on demand by consumers and others for functional foods and dietary supplements, which would in turn have a negative affect on the markets for our products. Such a negative effect could reduce our future revenues from sales of ReducolTM and other phytosterol products. Additionally, the current credit crisis has affected the availability and terms of debt and equity financings. We are dependent upon completion of a M&A Transaction or obtaining additional financing to continue as a going concern. Under current market conditions we may not be able to obtain financing an acceptable terms, or at all. Need for Growth and / or Merger & Acquisition Opportunities We intend to expand our sales of Reducol™ and other value-added products, and to diversify our product line with new types of nutraceutical products, however, there is no assurance that our resources will be able to adequately respond to support such growth or that there will exist a demand for such growth by our current and proposed customers. We also intend to build a strong nutraceutical base through merger and acquisition opportunities, which may not materialize. Dependence upon Key Personnel Our key management employees include Charles Butt, Chief Executive Officer and President; David Goold, Chief Financial Officer, and Laura Wessman, Senior Vice President, Operations. These key management employees are primarily responsible for our day to day operations, and we believe our ability to continue operations, increase sales, and complete a suitable M&A transaction or secure additional financing will depend, in large part, upon our ability to retain them and to attract and retain additional highly qualified management personnel. Our employment agreements with our key management employees permit such employees to terminate their employment on three months notice, in the case of Charles Butt, otherwise on thirty days notice. If we lose the services of any our key personnel, we may be unable to replace them, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, fi nancial condition, and ability to continue. 5 Volatility of Stock Price/Liquidity of Shares The market prices for the securities of companies such as ours have historically been highly volatile, and the market has, from time to time, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Factors such as fluctuations in our operating results, announcements of competing or new products by our competitors, clinical study results, governmental regulation, developments in patent or other proprietary rights, public concern as to the safety and efficacy of our products or those of our customers or competitors in the phytosterol market and general market conditions, delay in achieving or failure to achieve our previously announced milestones or goals, can have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares. In particular, the realization of any of the risks described herein could have a material adverse impact on such market price. Sales of substantial amounts of our shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales will occur, could also adversely affect the market price of our shares and make it more difficult in the future for us to raise funds through equity offerings. As a result of the volatility of our stock price, we do not currently meet the minimum listing requirements on The NASDAQ Capital Market or The Toronto Stock Exchange, and our shares may be de-listed from The NASDAQ Capital Market on or about December 21, 2009, and from the Toronto Stock Exchange on or about August 12, 2009. De-listing of us or our shares from either exchange could, and de-listing of our shares from both exchanges would, have a negative effect on the liquidity of our shares and/or the ability of a shareholder to trade in shares of the Company. Our common share price has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Stock Exchange Minimum Listing Requirements NASDAQ Our Common Shares are currently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and The NASDAQ Capital Market. On January 22, 2008 we received a NASDAQ Staff Determination, (the Staff Determination) indicating that we failed to comply with the US$1.00 Minimum Bid Price Requirement for continued listing set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(4), and that our securities were, therefore, subject to delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market. We requested and had a hearing before a NASDAQ Hearings Panel to review the Staff Determination, in which we presented a plan for compliance. The Panel granted our request for conditional listing, or an exception and we had until May 27, 2008 to regain compliance with NASDAQs Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The NASDAQ Hearings Panel granted the Company an extension through June 30, 2008, to demonstrate complianc e with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On June 17, 2008 the Company announced that it had demonstrated compliance with NASDAQs Minimum Bid Price Requirement, as evidenced by a closing bid price of $1.00 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days. Accordingly, the NASDAQ Hearings Panel determined that the Companys shares would continue, at that time, to be listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. On September 19, 2008 the Company received a NASDAQ Staff Deficiency Letter indicating that the bid price for its common stock had closed below the minimum of US$1.00 per share for the last 30 consecutive trading days, as required by Marketplace Rule 4320(e)(2)(E)(ii). NASDAQ provided Forbes with 180 calendar days, or until March 18, 2009, to regain compliance with this rule. In October 2008, NASDAQ decided to temporarily suspend enforcement of the bid price and market value of publicly held share requirements, given the extraordinary current market conditions, and in January 2009, decided to extend such suspension. A second extension was announced by NASDAQ on March 23, 2009, with the result that our compliance deadline is now December 21, 2009. As a result, Forbes now has until December 21, 2009 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement is normally demonstrated if the closing bid price for our common shares on The NASDAQ Capital Market is not less than US$1.00 for ten consecutive trading days. Depending upon the particular facts and circumstances, the NASDAQ Hearing Panel may, in its discretion, require that we evidence a bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a period in excess of ten consecutive trading days before determining that we have complied with the terms of the exception and demonstrated the ability to maintain long-term compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Failure to demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement within the appropriate time allowed will result in our shares being de-listed from The NASDAQ Capital Market. 6 The Toronto Stock Exchange On January 14, 2009, we announced that we had received notice from the Toronto Stock Exchange indicating that it is reviewing the eligibility of our common shares for continued listing on the TSX. The delisting review announced by the TSX relates to our market capitalization, which has fallen below the designated TSX threshold. Pursuant to the TSX's Remedial Review Process, Forbes has been given 210 days  until August 12, 2009  to regain compliance with the TSX continued listing requirements. Failure to regain compliance within the time allowed will result in our shares being de-listed from the TSX. De-listing De-listing of us or our shares from either NASDAQ or the TSX, or both, would likely have a negative effect on the liquidity of our shares, on the ability of a shareholder to trade in our shares, and on our ability to raise equity financing, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to continue. Anti-Takeover Provisions On February 9, 1998, our board of directors (the Board of Directors) adopted a shareholder rights plan which was amended and restated by our board of directors on April 28, 2003 (the Rights Plan). In December 2007, the Board of Directors extended the Rights Plan beyond its scheduled expiry date of February 9, 2008 to the next annual general meeting of the Company and, effective April 22, 2008, the Board of Directors further amended, extended and restated the Rights Plan. The Rights Plan as so amended, extended and restated was adopted by our shareholders at our Annual General Meeting on May 21, 2008. The Rights Plan was adopted in part to discourage takeover attempts that may not be in the best interests of our shareholders. The Rights Plan is designed to give our Board of Directors time to pursue other alternatives to maximize shareholder value in the event of an unsolicited takeover offer for Forbes. The effect of the Rights Plan could be to discourage a third party from attempting to acquire, or make it more difficult to acquire, control of Forbes without first negotiating with our Board of Directors. The Rights Plan could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common shares. Directors and Officers Indemnity We have entered into agreements pursuant to which we will indemnify our directors and officers for any claims made against them while acting in their capacity as such, which may adversely affect our finances. OPERATIONAL RISKS Dependence Upon a Few Customers and Products During the year ended December 31, 2008, we had phytosterol revenues of $7,844,000, most of which was revenue from sales with a small portion ($4,000) attributable to licensing revenues. Most of our revenue was earned from sales of phytosterols to four customers. We anticipate that we will be dependent on these customers for most of our revenues for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2009. Any material change in the relationship with such customers or in the demand for our phytosterol products will have a material effect on our business and results of operations. Our contract for the sale of Reducol™ to Pharmavite will end in June, 2009, and is subject to automatic one-year renewals unless either party provides 90 days’ prior written notice of its intention not to renew. While we have not received any non-renewal notice to date, there can be no a ssurance that this contract will be renewed. Failure to renew or otherwise extend this contract will have a material adverse effect on our product sales and revenue, and on the sustainability of our operations and ability to continue. In addition, our product line is currently limited to Reducol™ and other phytosterol products as cholesterol-lowering ingredients or products. Any decreases in consumer demand in Europe or lack of increase in consumer demand, particularly in the U.S., for phytosterol-containing consumer products, whether due to general economic market conditions, a change in public perception about nutraceuticals in general or phytosterol-containing products in particular, or other factors, would also have a material adverse on our product sales and revenue, and on the sustainability of our operations and ability to continue. 7 Competition The markets for nutraceutical ingredients and products are competitive and, as a result, we face competition from several different sources, including nutraceutical, food and dietary supplement companies and manufacturers. In the functional foods market, our products compete with the products of, among others, Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, Cargill Incorporated, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cognis and Raisio Staest Oy. These companies are more established, benefit from greater name recognition and have greater resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have greater experience in undertaking research and preclinical studies and human clinical studies on, obtaining regulatory approvals for, and manufacturing, distributing and marketing, new nutraceutical products. In addition, there are several other companies and products with which we may compete from time to time, and which may have better and larger resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in commercializing and marketing products more rapidly or effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new products enter the market. There can be no assurance that existing products or new products developed by our competitors will not be more effective, or be more effectively marketed and sold, than any that may be developed or sold by us. Competitive products may render our products obsolete and uncompetitive prior to recovering research, development or commercialization expenses incurred with respect to any such products. The dietary supplement market is very competitive as well as highly fragmented due to the diverse nature of the supplements available. According to the Nutrition Business Journal, dietary supplement manufacturers include companies such as Royal Numico, Wyeth, Bayer and Bristol Myers Squibb/Mead Johnson. Risks Related to Strategic Relationships We are dependent upon strategic relationships, and in particular, on Phyto-Source LP to manufacture product for supply to our customers. The breakdown of our relationships with our strategic partners may have a negative effect our future revenues and business, and such negative effect could be material. However, in the case of Phyto-Source, we believe that in the event that Phyto-Source were unable to provide us with required supplies, we have the technology and resources to engage another potential supplier in a timely manner and to use then existing inventories to support our product sales. Manufacturing Risks We have relied and will continue to rely heavily on contract manufacturers for the production of product required for our clinical studies, product formulation work, up-scaling experiments, and commercial production. We may not be able to obtain contract manufacturers to produce a sufficient quantity or quality of our products to conduct our clinical studies, product formulation work, up-scaling experiments and commercial production. Even if we are successful in securing manufacture of sufficient products for our clinical studies, product formulation work, up-scaling experiments and commercial production, we expect to rely on the efforts of contract manufacturers, including Phyto-Source, and third-party manufacturers to produce our products. Contract manufacturers may not be available or, if obtained, may not be reliable in meeting our requirements for cost, quality, quantity or schedule, or the requirements of any regulatory agencies. Any such failure would adversely affect our business. Factors beyond our control could cause interruption in operations at the Phyto-Source manufacturing facilities, or at other contract manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our ability to supply our customers and in turn could adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace and our business. These facilities could suffer an interruption caused by damage from a variety of sources, many of which are not within our control or that of our contract manufacturers, including, fire, flood and other natural disasters, power loss and telecommunication failure, software and hardware errors, failures or crashes and similar disruptions. These facilities could also suffer interruption, suspension of operations or closure due to global economic conditions, including the tightening of the credit markets, reduced business or loss of business from other customers, or failure to o btain required quantities of raw materials and other supplies from suppliers also suffering due to the economic crisis. Any significant interruptions in operations could interrupt our ability to supply our customers, which in turn could subject us to lawsuits, damage our reputation in the marketplace and have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to continue current operations 8 Risks Associated with Our Patents Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain, enforce and maintain patent protection for our technology and our products, in Canada, the United States and other countries. We cannot be assured that patents will issue from any pending applications or that claims now or in the future, if any, allowed under issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology and patented products. In addition, no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide continuing competitive advantages to us. To date, there have been challenges to some of our European patents. (See Item 8 - Financial Information - A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information - Legal Matters.) The patent positions of companies such as ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, it is not known whether any of our research endeavors will result in the issuance of patents in Canada, the United States, or elsewhere, or if any patents already issued will provide significant proprietary protection or will be circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, we cannot be certain that we or any licensor was the first to create inventions claimed by pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Loss of patent protection could lead to generic competition for our products, and others in the future, which would materially and adversely affect the financial prospects for these products and us. There is no assurance that our patents will be held valid or enforceable by a court or that a competitors technology or product would be found to infringe such patents. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain and enforce effective patents to protect our proprietary rights from use by competitors, and the patents of other parties could require us to stop using or pay to use certain intellectual property, and as such, our competitive position and profitability could suffer as a result. Risks Associated with Our Intellectual Property Rights Our success is dependent not only on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, but also upon the protection of rights of third parties from which we have licensed intellectual property rights. We hold, directly or indirectly, rights to various patents and trade marks and rights to various pending patent and trade mark applications in Canada, the United States, and other jurisdictions. In addition, we rely upon certain other technologies, ideas, know-how, secrets or other information, which we may not be able to protect. Notwithstanding precautions we may take to protect our rights, third parties may copy or obtain and use our proprietary and licensed technologies, ideas, know-how, secrets and other proprietary information without authorization or independently develop technologies similar or superior to our proprietary and licensed technolo gies. We enter into confidentiality and restriction on use agreements with our employees, strategic partners and others; however, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary and licensed technologies or other intellectual property in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. Policing unauthorized use of such technologies and intellectual property is extremely difficult, and the cost of enforcing our rights through litigation may be prohibitive. Further, the laws of jurisdictions other than Canada and the United States may not provide meaningful protection of our and such third parties intellectual property rights. Risks Associated with Claims of Infringement of Proprietary Rights of Others The nutraceutical industry increasingly relies on intellectual property rights for the manufacture, use and sale of new products that may be the subject of conflicting proprietary rights. As a result, there is a substantial risk that we, or our licensors, may become subject to litigation alleging that our or such licensors products and technologies infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. Whether or not our or such licensors products or technologies infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, we or such licensors could incur significant expenses in defending allegations of infringement of proprietary rights. Further, we or such licensors may be required to modify our or their products or obtain licenses for intellectual property rights as a result of any alleged proprietary infringement. We or such li censors may not be able to modify ours or their products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, in a timely manner, or at all, any of which could adversely affect our business. There can be no assurance that third-party claims will not in the future adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 9 Risk of Market Acceptance There can be no assurance that any of our products in development or products recently launched will achieve or sustain market acceptance. Further, there can be no assurance that products launched by third parties containing ReducolTM or any of our other phytosterol products will achieve sustained market acceptance. The degree of market acceptance for our products, and those of our customers, will depend upon a number of factors, including competitive pricing, the extent to which the products fulfill customers expectations and demands, the receipt of regulatory approvals, the establishment and demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of the products, the establishment and demonstration of the potential advantages over competing products and the acceptance of the listing of the product and appropriate distribution with large retailers. There can be no assurance that consumers, distributors, retailers or suppliers in general will accept and utilize any existing or new products that may be developed by us. Acquisition or Development of Additional Nutraceutical Products To achieve sustained, profitable operations, we must acquire or successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for, and profitably manufacture and market nutraceutical products in addition to Reducol™ and our other phytosterol products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully acquire or develop other products. The development and commercialization of new products is subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, particularly in the emerging nutraceutical industry which is highly speculative in nature. Potential products that appear to be promising in various stages of development, may not reach the market, or if reached (such as Reducol™), may not achieve profitable sales levels, for a number of reasons such as: · the discovery of unexpected toxicities or lack of sufficient efficacy of products which make them unattractive or unsuitable for human use; · preliminary results may not be substantiated in later clinical studies or other further testing; · manufacturing costs or other factors, such as the need for new manufacturing processes, may make manufacturing of products impractical, non-competitive or delayed; · proprietary rights of third parties or competing products or technologies may preclude commercialization; · inability to receive necessary regulatory approvals from local and international government and regulators to manufacture, label, advertise, make claims and sell our products; · unacceptability of the products in the market place; · inability to protect our intellectual property rights necessary for the research and development, manufacture and sale of our products or commercialization obstacles imposed by patents held by third parties; · the termination, expiry or inability to use proprietary processes, products or information owned by third parties needed for the manufacture and sale of products developed or acquired by us; · the risk of obsolescence of our technology; · insufficient availability of raw materials and the inability to obtain raw materials on acceptable terms; and · other factors that may become apparent during the course of research, up-scaling or manufacturing which may result in the discontinuation of research and other critical projects. Products that we may develop will never have been manufactured on a commercial scale, and there can be no assurance that such products can be manufactured at a cost or in a quantity to render such products commercially viable. Production of our products may require the development of new manufacturing technologies and expertise. The impact on our business in the event that new manufacturing technologies and expertise are required to be developed is uncertain. There can be no assurance that we will successfully meet any of these technological challenges, or others that may arise in the course of development. 10 Risks Related to Clinical Claims and Studies Clinical claims regarding the efficacy of our products can be advantageous to distinguish finished nutraceutical products from their conventional counterparts. Clinical studies of Reducol™ conducted by or for us in the USA, Europe and Canada have demonstrated a significant LDL cholesterol lowering effect, between 10 to 15%, using various food matrices such as vegetable spreads and oils, yogurts, chocolate, and milk drinks. These studies have been conducted under particular test conditions and parameters and there can be no assurance that results achieved in studies conducted by or for us will be achieved in other studies with different conditions and/or parameters. Clinical studies proving the efficacy of our phytosterols in a wide variety of foods, beverages and dietary supplements have not yet been completed, and there can be no assurance that sufficient efficacy will be demonstrated in any particular product, if required to support commercialization of that product. In addition, further studies may be required by regulatory authorities in certain countries prior to permitting phytosterol products to be sold in those countries, or in order to support health claims made by us or our customers. There can be no assurance that future clinical studies as required by regulatory authorities will result in required regulatory approvals. Failure to obtain such approval may have an adverse effect on our business, and such effect could be material. Risk of Technical Obsolescence The nutraceutical industry is characterized by rapidly changing markets, technology, emerging industry standards and frequent introduction of new products. The introduction of new products embodying new technologies, including new manufacturing processes, and the emergence of new industry standards may render our products obsolete, less competitive or less marketable. The process of developing our products is extremely complex and requires significant continuing development efforts and third party commitments. Our failure to develop new technologies and products and the obsolescence of existing technologies could adversely affect our business. Because the nutraceutical industry is characterized by rapid technology change and obsolescence, we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential customer requirements that could make our existing technology obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and services, develop new technology that addresses the increasing sophistication and varied needs of our current and future customers, license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of our proprietary technology and investing in certain niche markets entails significant technical and business risks. We may not be successful in using our new technologies or exploiting our niche markets effectively or adapting our businesses to evolving customer or medical requirements or preferences or emerging in dustry standards. Government Regulation Generally Some products manufactured by us will have to comply with the FDAs current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and other FDA and local government guidelines and regulations, including other international regulatory requirements and guidelines. Additionally, certain of our customers may require the manufacturing facilities contracted by us to adhere to additional manufacturing standards, even if not required by the FDA. Compliance with cGMP regulations requires manufacturers to expend time, money and effort in production, and to maintain precise records and quality control to ensure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. The FDA and other regulatory bodies periodically inspect drug-manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with applicable cGMP requirements. If the manufacturing facilities contracted by us fail to comply with the cGMP r equirements, the facilities may become subject to possible FDA or other regulatory action and manufacturing at the facility could consequently be suspended. We may not be able to contract suitable alternative or back-up manufacturing facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all. The FDA or other regulatory agencies may also require the submission of any lot of a particular product for inspection. If the lot product fails to meet the FDA requirements, then the FDA could take any of the following actions: (i) restrict the release of the product; (ii) suspend manufacturing of the specific lot of the product; (iii) order a recall of the lot of the product; or (iv) order a seizure of the lot of the product. 11 We are subject to regulation by governments in many jurisdictions and, if we do not comply with food, manufacturing and environmental regulations, among others, our existing and future operations may be curtailed, and we could be subject to liability. In addition to the regulatory approval process, we may be subject to regulations under local, provincial, state, federal and foreign law, including requirements regarding occupational health safety, laboratory practices, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, and may be subject to other present and future local, provincial, state, federal and foreign regulations, including possible future regulations of the food ingredient, dietary supplement and pharmaceutical industries. We cannot predict the time required for regulatory approval, or the extent of clinical testing and documentation that may be required by regulatory authorities. We may not be able to obtain the approval of regulatory authorities in any country to market our products or make appropriate label claims, or if obtained, that the approval will be given in a timely manner or that such approval will not later be revoked. Any delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, or other countries would significantly delay or prevent the development of our markets and products and would therefore adversely and severely affect our business. Government Regulation of Functional Foods The regulatory process for the approval of functional foods in a number of countries is currently in a state of uncertainty, which may negatively impact the marketing of our phytosterol products. For example, prior to June, 2001, Australia had no regulations governing functional foods. However, in June of 2001, the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) regulations governing novel foods, including foods containing plant sterols, came into force with the result that previously unregulated novel foods, including products enriched with Reducol™, were voluntarily withdrawn from the market pending regulatory approval. In 2004, regulations for Natural Health Products (NHP) were passed in Canada. This regulatory route allows the marketing of phytosterols in standard dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, and syrups. Therapeutic and health claims for phytosterols in Natural Health Products are permitted under these regulations. Separate applications have been made to NHP to sell Reducol™ in tablets, soft gelatin capsules and in soft gelatin capsules with Reducol™/Omega-3-fatty acids. The Natural Health Products Directorate currently has a very large backlog of applications. The time required for approval is expected to be lengthy. In the United States, our phytosterols are currently permitted to be included in food or as dietary supplements and the FDA has issued a letter to us allowing us to use a heart-health claim for our phytosterols. There can be no assurance that the current regulations will not be modified or that such modifications will not have an adverse effect on our ability to continue to distribute or advertise such products in the United States with the heart-health claim for our phytosterols. In the EU, we have received approval to market Reducol™ in a variety of approved food groups (See Item 4 – Information on the Company – B. Business Overview – Our Nutraceuticals - Reducol™ and Functional Foods). There can be no assurance that such approval will not be modified in a manner adverse to our business, or will not be revoked in its entirety. Restrictions on Product Labeling and Advertising The FDA, which regulates product labeling, has issued a letter allowing us to use a heart-health claim for our phytosterol products. There can be no assurance that the FDA will not revoke the permission granted to us to make the claim. Regulatory agencies in Europe and other countries may regulate claims made regarding functional foods and their efficacy. Similarly, the United States Federal Trade Commission and its counterparts in other countries may place restrictions on our ability to make claims regarding the efficacy of our products in advertising. Restrictions on product claims may impede our efforts to gain general market acceptance for our products at a premium price, which would adversely affect our business. Currently, the pricing of functional foods generally exceeds the pricing of similar conventional foods, and clinical claims are necessary to maintain t he competitive position of functional foods. 12 Product Liability, Negative Publicity and Insurance The sale of our phytosterol products, or the use of our nutraceutical products in clinical studies, may expose us to liability claims which could adversely affect us. Such claims might be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers or by manufacturers or distributors of finished goods incorporating our products, or by others selling or consuming such products. Our insurance may not cover any potential claim or if coverage is available, may not provide sufficient coverage to protect us against loss. We may not be able to maintain or obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for future products, and any claims under any insurance policies may adversely affect our ability to maintain existing policies or to obtain new insurance on existing or future products. Further, even if sufficient insurance coverage is available to cover any potentia l claim, publicity associated with any such claim could adversely affect public opinion regarding the safety or efficacy of our products. As a result, any product liability claim or recall could seriously adversely affect our business. Risks Relating to Supply and Sale of Raw Materials We rely on the availability of raw materials, such as phytosterols, at commercially reasonable prices for the production and development of our sterol-based products and technology. We may not be able to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely fashion or at acceptable quality, quantity, timing or prices to satisfy our complete long-term requirements. Our inability to obtain raw materials at acceptable qualities, quantities, timing or prices would adversely affect our business. No Assurance Regarding Licensing of Proprietary Technology Owned by Others The manufacture and sale of any products we have developed may involve the use of proprietary processes, products or information, which are owned by third parties. Although we have obtained licenses or rights with regard to the use of certain of such processes, products and information as best we can, there is no assurance that such licenses or rights will not be terminated or expire during critical periods, that we will be able to obtain licenses or other rights which may be important to us, or, if obtained, that such licenses will be obtained on favorable terms. Some of these licenses provide for limited periods of exclusivity that may be extended only with the consent of the licensor. There is no assurance that extensions will be granted on any or all such licenses. This same restriction may be contained in licenses obtained in the future. To maintain these agreements in good standing, we must abide by the terms of such agreements, and the loss of any of such agreements due to default could have a materially adverse impact on our operations. There are no assurances that we will be able to renew or renegotiate the licensing agreements on acceptable terms if and when the agreements terminate. Risk of Side Effects There is a risk that an individual could experience side effects, yet to be determined, through consumption of foods and dietary supplements containing Reducol™ or our other phytosterol products. We could face future liability for unknown side effects and any such liability could exceed our resources. Political and Economic Risks We rely in part on third parties located in the United States and other foreign countries for the development and manufacture of our products. The current political and economic climate in these countries may be considered less predictable than in Canada. Changes in government, economic and political policies may adversely affect our business and operating results. Inflation or other changes in economic conditions that affect demand for nutraceutical products could adversely affect our revenue. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and our customers may postpone spending in response to a number of factors such as tighter credit markets, negative financial news, declines in investment values or income, negative changes in employment compensation, or suspension or loss of employment or anticipation thereof, and other economic factors affectin g consumer spending. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results. 13 Environmental Risks Research, development and commercial processes involve use of materials which may result in by-products that may be hazardous. The Company, our strategic partners, distributors, manufacturers, sales agents and others involved in handling materials are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products. There is a risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials which cannot be eliminated. We could be liable for any resulting damages and any such liability could exceed our resources. We may also be required to obtain permits to transport and dispose of hazardous waste under applicable environmental laws. We may not be able to obtain such permits, which would adversely affect our ability to efficiently manufacture or transport our products. We, our strategic partners, distributors, sales agents, manuf acturers and others involved in handling materials may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future or to remediate environmental violations. We may be adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations. Any failure by us to comply with the present or future environmental laws in Canada and the United States, or elsewhere, could result in any of the following: (i) cessation of portions or all of our operations; (ii) imposition of fines; (iii) restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand operations; (iv) significant expenditures by us in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations; or (v) liabilities in excess of our resources. Any of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to dispose of our waste products in a cost effective or timely manner, or at all. Foreign Currency and Exchange Our functional currency is the Canadian dollar. We operate and intend to continue operating in several foreign markets. As such, cash flows from such foreign operations will be subject to fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate of the applicable currency. Risks Related to Material Contractual Obligations We have obligations under a number of contracts, and failure to meet our obligations under any of our material contracts may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. In particular, but without limitation, failure to meet our obligations under the Pharmavite License & Supply Agreement or the Phyto-Source Supply Agreement (and amendments thereto), and the Forbes-Fayrefield Joint Venture Agreement may adversely affect our assets and business. (See Item 10 - Additional Information  C. Material Contracts). Alternatively, failure on the part of the other party to each material contract to meet their respective obligations may also adversely affect our operations and finances. There exists the possibility that any or all of our material contracts may be renegotiated, amended, terminated, or not renewed, and there is n o guarantee that such action will be favourable to us. Risks Related to Legal Proceedings Any costs associated with legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, attorney fees, filing fees, and damages, may adversely affect our assets and business, whether the outcome of the proceedings is favourable to us or not. (See Item 8  Financial Information  A. Legal Matters). Adherence to Time Frames We set goals and make public statements regarding our expected timing of meeting our objectives, such as the identification of lead compounds. The actual timing of these forward looking events can vary dramatically due to a number of factors, including other risk factors identified herein. There can be no assurance that our objectives will be met within the time lines we expect or at all.
