Item 1A. Risk Factors. Investing in ENR Stock involves risks. Energizer may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports it files with the SEC in the future. General economic conditions can significantly affect Energizer’s financial results. Energizer’s financial results can be significantly affected by general economic conditions, inflationary pressures, high labor or material costs and unforeseen changes in consumer demand or buying patterns. Changes in Energizer’s ability to generate sufficient internal cash flows, as well as access to capital markets, interest rate fluctuations and other conditions which impact the ability to borrow, may negatively affect Energizer’s ability to support capital expansion plans, share repurchase programs, general operations, research and development activity, and advertising and promotional activities. Energizer operates in a highly competitive industry. The battery industry and the wet-shave industry are highly competitive, both in the United States and on a global basis, as a limited number of large manufacturers compete for consumer acceptance and, increasingly, limited retail shelf space. Competition is based upon brand perceptions, product performance and innovation, customer service and price. Energizer’s ability to compete effectively may be affected by a number of factors: · Energizer’s primary competitor, The Procter & Gamble Company, has substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources, and greater market share, than Energizer does, as well as significant advantages in distribution, sales and negotiating leverage with retailers. · Energizer’s competitors, in both of the industries in which it competes, may have lower production, sales and distribution costs, and higher profit margins, than Energizer, which may enable them to compete more aggressively in offering retail discounts and other promotional incentives. · Loss of key retail customers to competitors may erode Energizer’s market share. Both the battery and the wet shave industries have been notable for the pace of innovations in product life, product design and applied technology. Energizer and its competitors have made and continue to make significant investments in research and development with the goal of further innovation. If competitors introduce new or enhanced products that significantly outperform Energizer’s, or if they develop or apply manufacturing technology which permits them to manufacture at a significantly lower cost relative to Energizer’s, Energizer may be unable to compete successfully in the market segments affected by these changes. Energizer’s foreign operations are very significant to it, and results can be impacted by a number of risks specific to international operations. Energizer’s businesses are currently conducted on a worldwide basis, with more than half of its sales arising out of foreign operations, and a significant portion of its production capacity located overseas. Consequently, Energizer is subject to a number of significant risks associated with its subsidiaries doing business in foreign countries. The operating profits of Energizer may decline because of changes in the value of local currencies, or because of hyperinflationary conditions in developing economies. Other risks and considerations include: · the effect of foreign income and withholding taxes and the U.S. tax implications of foreign source income and losses, and other restrictions on the flow of capital between countries; · the possibility of expropriation, confiscatory taxation or price controls; · adverse changes in local investment or exchange control regulations; · political instability, government nationalization of business or industries, government corruption, and civil unrest.
