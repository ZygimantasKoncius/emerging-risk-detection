Risk factors The information on risk factors required by this Item is incorporated by reference herein from pages 96 through 102 of the 2008 Annual Report under the heading Risk categories and factors. It describes some of the risks that could affect Philips businesses. The risk factors and the cautionary statements contained in the section entitled Introduction on page 3 should be considered in connection with any forward-looking statements contained in Philips Annual Report on Form 20-F. Forward-looking statements can be identified generally as those containing words such as anticipates, assumes, believes, estimates, expects, should, will, will likely result, forecast, outlook, projects or similar expressions. From time to time, Philips may also provide oral or written forward-looking statements in other materials Philips releases to the public. The cautionary statements contained in Introduction are deemed to apply to these statements. The risks described are not the only ones that Philips faces. Some risks are not yet known to Philips and certain risks that Philips does not currently believe to be material could later turn out to be material. All of these risks could materially affect Philips business, its revenues, operating income, net income, net assets and liquidity and capital resources. 7 Table of Contents
