Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is cyclical in nature and our industry is currently experiencing softening market conditions which may affect our financial performance, our ability to grow and the price of our common shares. Historically, the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance industry has tended to fluctuate in cyclical patterns. Although an individual insurance companys financial performance is dependent on its own specific business characteristics, the profitability of most property and casualty insurance companies tends to follow this cyclical market pattern. This cyclicality is due in large part to the actions of industry participants, such as inadequate pricing and increasingly broad policy terms, general economic factors, such as low interest rates, the impact of terrorist attacks and severe weather, none of which is within our control. These cyclical patterns cause our revenues and net income to fluctuate, which may cause the price of our common shares to be volatile. During the past five years, many admitted insurers returned to more risk-based underwriting disciplines in the standard market, resulting in higher premium rates, less flexible terms and, in some cases, an unavailability of adequate insurance coverage in the standard market in some classes. We, along with other excess and surplus lines insurers, benefited from this increase in rates and volume. During 2006, however, the excess and surplus lines industry began to experience softer market conditions primarily attributed to intensified competition from admitted and surplus lines insurers, resulting in slight rate decreases. Because these market conditions are due in large part to the actions of our competitors and general economic factors, we cannot predict the timing or duration of these conditions. This increased competition intensified in 2007 and is continuing in 2008. Our success depends on our ability to appropriately price the risks we underwrite. Our financial condition depends on our ability to underwrite and set premium rates accurately for a wide variety of risks. Rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price our products accurately, we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data, develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas, closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully and price our products accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control, including:  the availability of sufficient reliable data and our ability to properly analyze available data;  the uncertainties that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions;  our selection and application of appropriate rating and pricing techniques; and  changes in legal standards, claim settlement practices, medical care expenses and restoration costs. Consequently, we could under-price risks, which would negatively affect our profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our sales volume and competitiveness. In either event, our profitability could be materially and adversely affected. 32 Table of Contents Our actual incurred losses may be greater than our loss and loss expense reserves, which could cause our future earnings, liquidity and financial rating to decline. We are liable for loss and loss expenses under the terms of the insurance policies we write. In many cases, several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss. We establish loss and loss expense reserves for our estimate of the ultimate payment of all loss and loss expenses incurred. If any of our reserves prove to be inadequate, we will be required to increase reserves resulting in a reduction in our net income in the period in which the inadequacy is identified. Future loss experience substantially in excess of established reserves could also cause our future earnings, liquidity and financial rating to decline. These reserves are based on historical data and estimates of future events and by their nature are imprecise. Our ultimate loss and loss expenses may vary from established reserves. Furthermore, several factors may have a substantial impact on our future loss experience. These factors may include:  inflation in the size of claims;  claims development patterns;  legislative and judicial activity;  social and economic patterns; and  litigation and regulatory trends. Additionally, we have established loss and loss expense reserves for certain lines of business we have exited, but circumstances could develop that would make these reserves insufficient. As of December 31, 2007, unpaid loss and loss expense reserves (net of reserves ceded to our reinsurers) were $238.4 million, consisting of case loss and loss expense reserves of $70.0 million and incurred but not reported loss and loss expense reserves of $168.4 million. We have re-estimated our loss and loss expense reserves attributable to insured events in prior years. These reestimations resulted in a (decrease) increase in reserves of $(9.1) million, $(1.1) million and $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Severe weather conditions and other catastrophes may result in an increase in the number and amount of claims experienced by our insureds. Most of our property business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including natural events such as severe hurricanes, winter weather, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe thunderstorms and fires, and other events such as explosions, terrorist attacks and riots. The incidence and severity of catastrophes and severe weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. Severe weather conditions and catastrophes can cause losses in all of our property lines and generally result in an increase in the number of claims incurred as well as the amount of compensation sought by claimants because every geographic location in which we provide insurance policies is subject to the risk of severe weather conditions. In 2005, we recorded $5.4 million of after tax losses related to the hurricane season. Throughout 2007, 2006 and prior to December 31, 2004, we have not been materially impacted by catastrophic events. We use a model that is commonly used throughout the industry to help us ensure that we are purchasing sufficient catastrophe reinsurance limits. Currently, we purchase catastrophe reinsurance to cover a potential catastrophe that is modeled to only occur once every 500 years. There can be no assurance that this modeled information will accurately predict catastrophic losses. It is possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could cause our loss and loss expense reserves to increase and our liquidity and financial condition to decline. A decline in our financial rating assigned by A.M. Best may result in a reduction of new or renewal business. A.M. Best, an insurance rating agency, assigns ratings that generally are based on an insurance companys ability to pay policyholder obligations. The A.M. Best ratings criteria focus on capital adequacy, loss and loss 33 Table of Contents expense reserve adequacy and operating performance. A reduction in our performance in these criteria could result in a downgrade of an insurance companys rating. Our insurance subsidiaries received an A− (excellent) pooled annual rating in 2007 from A.M. Best. A downgrade of our rating below A− (excellent) could cause our current and future general agents, retail brokers and insureds to choose other, more highly rated competitors which would have an adverse impact on our financial results. We may incur increased costs in competing for underwriting revenue. If we are unable to compete effectively with the large number of companies in the insurance industry for underwriting revenues, our underwriting revenues and net income may decline. We compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business. We face competition from specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies and intermediaries, as well as from diversified financial services companies that are significantly larger than we are and that have significantly greater financial, marketing, management and other resources than we do. Some of these competitors also have significantly greater experience and market recognition than we do. In its annual U.S. Surplus Lines Market Review Special Report, published in October 2007, A.M. Best stated that the large, well established insurance carriers continue to dominate the excess and surplus lines market, with the top 25 insurance groups commanding an 81% share of the market. While we believe opportunities are available in this market, the leading insurance carriers have a firm stronghold. We are not one of the 25 largest insurance carriers in the excess and surplus lines market. Competition in this market is generally based on many factors, including  the perceived market strength of the insurer in a particular line;  pricing and other terms and conditions;  service;  promptness of claims payment;  the reputation and experience of the insurer; and  ratings assigned by independent ratings organizations, such as A.M. Best. We compete primarily on the basis of service. We may incur increased costs in competing for premiums. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate or to expand our operations into new markets, our underwriting revenues and net income may decline. A number of new, proposed or potential legislative and industry developments could further increase competition in our industry. These developments include:  an increase in capital-raising by companies in our lines of business, which could result in new entrants to our markets and an excess of capital in the industry;  the implementation of commercial lines deregulation in several states, which could increase competition from standard carriers for our excess and surplus lines of insurance business;  programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas; and  changing practices caused by the Internet, which may lead to greater competition in the insurance business. New competition from these developments could cause the supply and/or demand for insurance or reinsurance to change, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and thereby affect our underwriting results. Ultimately, this competition could affect our ability to attract business at premium rates that are likely to generate underwriting profits. 34 Table of Contents We distribute our products through a select group of general agents, ten of which account for a significant part of our business, and such relationships could be discontinued or cease to be profitable. We distribute our products through a select group of general agents. Of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2007, 52.1% were distributed through ten general agents. In 2007, our largest agency group, with locations in seven states, accounted for $43.3 million (18.2%) of our total gross written premiums. A loss of all or substantially all the business produced by one or more of these general agents could have a negative impact on our revenues. We may not be successful in developing our new specialty lines or new classes of insureds through our program unit that could cause us to experience losses. Since 2003, we have entered into several new specialty lines of business and more than ten new offerings through our program unit, including commercial auto physical damage, garage liability and ocean marine. We continue to look for appropriate opportunities to diversify our business portfolio by offering new lines of insurance in which we believe we have sufficient underwriting and claim expertise. However, because of our limited history in these new lines, there is limited financial information available to help us evaluate whether we will be able to successfully develop these new lines or the likely ultimate losses and expenses associated with these new lines. We also may have less experience managing their development and growth than some of our competitors. Additionally, there is a risk that the lines of business into which we expand will not perform at the levels we anticipate. We may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do, we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures. As part of our present strategy, we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the start-up of complementary business ventures on an ongoing basis, and at any given time, we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures, that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful. The process of integrating any company involves a number of special risks, including the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations, unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems, problems concerning assimilating and retaining the employees of the acquired company, challenges in retaining customers and potential adverse short-term effects on operating results. In addition, we may incur debt to finance future acquisitions and we may issue securities in connection with future acquisitions which may dilute the holdings of our current and future shareholders. If we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our growth strategy could be adversely affected. Furthermore, our current acquisition strategy may include the evaluation of potential acquisitions of privately-held companies. Because privately-held companies are generally not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, such companies may not have adequate internal control procedures, which may, during our integration with any such company, have an adverse affect on our internal controls. Our investment results and, therefore, our financial condition may be impacted by changes in the business, financial condition or operating results of the entities in which we invest, illiquid credit markets, as well as changes in government monetary policies, general economic conditions and overall capital market conditions, all of which impact interest rates. Our results of operations depend, in part, on the performance of our investments. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on and the fair value of our fixed-maturity securities and equity securities. In addition, market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities and equity securities are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes and increase or decrease our shareholders equity as reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest rates in the United States are currently low relative to historical levels. Our available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities and equity securities are currently in a net unrealized loss position, and an increase in interest rates would further reduce the fair value of 35 Table of Contents our investments in available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities and equity securities. In addition, defaults by third parties who fail to pay or perform obligations could reduce our investment income and could result in investment losses in our portfolio. We had fixed-maturity and equity investments with a fair value of $450.8 million as of December 31, 2007 that are subject to:  credit risk, which is the risk that our investments will decrease in value due to unfavorable changes in the financial prospects or a downgrade in the credit rating of an entity in which we have invested;  equity price risk, which is the risk that we will incur economic loss due to a decline in common or preferred stock or bond mutual fund share prices; and  interest rate risk, which is the risk that our investments may decrease in value due to changes in interest rates. Our fixed-maturity investment portfolio had a fair value of $407.6 million as of December 31, 2007 and includes mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations totaled $154.7 million and constituted 33.1% of our cash and investment portfolio. As with other fixed-maturity investments, the fair value of these securities fluctuates depending on market and other general economic conditions and the interest rate environment. Changes in interest rates can expose us to prepayment risks on these investments. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities are paid more quickly, requiring us to reinvest the proceeds at the then prevailing market rates. Our equity portfolio totaled $43.2 million as of December 31, 2007. This total includes $29.0 million of investments in preferred and common securities of individual companies, which are subject to economic loss from the decline in preferred and common share prices. As a result, the value of these investments are driven by the specific financial prospects of these individual companies, as well as the equity markets in general. The remaining $14.2 million of our equity portfolio is invested in bond mutual funds. The book value of our sub-prime residential mortgage backed securities as of December 31, 2007 was $8.4 million. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with weak credit profiles. We are not an originator of below-prime mortgages. The slowing U.S. housing market, greater use of affordability mortgage products, and relaxed underwriting standards for some originators of below-prime loans has recently led to higher delinquency and loss rates, especially within the 2006 and 2007 vintage years. We do not own any sub-prime securities that are backed by mortgage loans made in either 2006 or 2007. These factors have caused a pull-back in market liquidity and repricing of risk, which has led to an increase in unrealized losses from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007. We expect delinquency and loss rates in the sub-prime mortgage sector to be volatile in the near term. In accordance with EITF 99-20, we have performed cash flow analysis on our sub-prime holdings stressing multiple variables, including prepayment speeds, default rates, and loss severity. Based on this analysis and our expectation of future loan performance, other than certain credit-related impairments recorded in the current year, future payments are expected to be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the securities. For a discussion on credit-related impairments, see Other-Than-Temporary Impairments section included under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Investment Results below. During 2007, the U.S. financial markets have experienced a significant level of volatility in the value of the equity markets and a spread widening in the fixed-maturity markets. In addition, certain sectors of fixed-maturity securities, primarily asset backed securities, experienced a significant level of illiquidity and price dislocation, each of which also affect the value of our fixed-maturity securities. As of December 31, 2007, our fixed-maturity securities, equity securities, preferred shares and bond mutual funds, had a fair value of $450.8 million, which represents 96.5% of our total cash and investment portfolio, these securities are subject to changes in fair value based on fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2007, a 200 basis point decline in interest rates would result in a $42.3 million, or 9.5% increase in fair value of our portfolio and a 200 basis point increase would result in a $45.0 million, or 10.0%, decrease in fair value of our portfolio. As of December 31, 2007, our investment portfolio had a net unrealized investment loss, after the effect of income taxes of $8.7 million. However, these unrealized 36 Table of Contents losses may not persist in the current economic environment or may not be realized or the ultimate loss may be greater. Our investment performance may suffer as a result of adverse capital market developments or other factors, which may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business. We invest the premiums we receive from policyholders until it is needed to pay policyholder claims or other expenses. Our investment portfolio is managed by three outside independent investment managers, all of which operate under investment guidelines approved by our investment committee. Although we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity from operations, investing and financing activities to meet our anticipated insurance obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs, our investments are subject to a variety of risks, including risks relating to general economic conditions, market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, liquidity risk and credit and default risk. In particular, the volatility of our claims may force us to liquidate securities, which may cause us to incur capital losses. If we do not structure our investment portfolio so that it is appropriately matched with our insurance liabilities, we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to cover such liabilities. Investment losses could significantly decrease our asset base and statutory surplus, thereby affecting our ability to conduct business. If we are not able to renew our existing reinsurance or obtain new reinsurance, either our net exposure would increase or we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitment. In 2008, for our property business, we retain the first $500,000 of a loss and share on a quota share basis 18% of the loss amount that exceeds $500,000 up to $1.0 million. For example, if we have a casualty policy that has a $600,000 loss, the reinsurer will be liable to us for $82,000 of the loss. For our casualty business, we retain the first $500,000 of a loss and share on a quota share basis 50% of the loss amount that exceeds $500,000 up to $1.0 million. For example, if we have a casualty policy that has a $600,000 loss, the reinsurer will be liable to us for $50,000 of the loss. In 2007, we purchased property excess of loss reinsurance to limit our loss from a single occurrence on any one coverage part from any one policy to $500,000. For example, if we have a property policy that has a $600,000 loss, the reinsurer will be liable to us for $100,000 of the loss. For our casualty business, we retain the first $500,000 of a loss and share on a quota share basis 50% of the loss amount that exceeds $500,000 up to $1.0 million. For example, if we have a casualty policy that has a $600,000 loss, the reinsurer will be liable to us for $50,000 of the loss. Further, we purchase catastrophe reinsurance to limit losses arising from any single occurrence, to $4.0 million up to $15.2 million, regardless of how many policyholders are involved or the extent of their loss,. We purchase casualty clash coverage for the loss amount above $1.0 million up to $19.0 million for any single occurrence, regardless of the number of policyholders involved. However, we may choose in the future to re-evaluate the use of reinsurance to increase or decrease the amount of liability we cede to reinsurers, depending upon the cost and availability of reinsurance. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection that we purchase. The reinsurance market has changed dramatically over the past few years as a result of inadequate pricing, poor underwriting and the significant losses incurred in conjunction with the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 and the 2004 and 2005 hurricane storm seasons. As a result, reinsurers have exited some lines of business, reduced available capacity and implemented provisions in their contracts designed to reduce their exposure to loss. In addition, the historical results of reinsurance programs and the availability of capital also affect the availability of reinsurance. The reinsurance market improved throughout 2006, 2007 and 2008 due to a moderate hurricane season. Our reinsurance facilities generally are subject to annual renewal. If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase, which could increase our exposure to loss, or, if we were unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, especially catastrophe exposed risks, which would reduce our revenues. To the extent that we are forced to pay more for reinsurance or retain more liability than we do currently, we may need to reduce the volume of insurance we write. Due to the underwriting profile of our business, we have not been 37 Table of Contents significantly impacted by the changes in the reinsurance market described above either in claims or reinsurance terms and pricing. Our reinsurers may not pay claims made by us on losses in a timely fashion or may not pay some or all of these claims, in each case causing our costs to increase and our revenues to decline. We purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk we have assumed (known as ceding) to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us (the reinsured) of our liability to our policyholders. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. That is, our reinsurers may not pay claims made by us on a timely basis, or they may not pay some or all of these claims. Either of these events would increase our costs. As of December 31, 2007, we had $44.8 million of amounts recoverable from our reinsurers that we would be obligated to pay if our reinsurers failed to pay. We have recorded a provision for uncollectible amounts of $3.4 million at December 31, 2007 and $4.1 million at December 31, 2006, which relates to balances due from reinsurers that are in dispute. We are subject to extensive regulation, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. General. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations, administered primarily by Ohio and Texas, our domiciliary states, and to a lesser degree, the other states in which we are licensed or admitted to sell insurance. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders, as opposed to the interests of shareholders. These regulations are generally administered by a department of insurance in each state and relate to, among other things, excess and surplus lines of business authorizations, capital and surplus requirements, rate and form approvals, investment parameter restrictions, underwriting limitations, affiliate transactions, dividend limitations, changes in control and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of our business. In addition, we are subject to privacy regulations and restrictions on our ability to cancel or not renew a policy or to withdraw from one or more lines of business within a state. Significant changes in these laws and regulations could limit our discretion or make it more expensive to conduct our business. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory requirements may adversely affect or inhibit our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. Required Licensing. Regulatory authorities have broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, where there is uncertainty as to applicability, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe generally to be followed by the industry. These practices may ultimately be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Further, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Risk-Based Capital. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has adopted a system to test the adequacy of statutory capital, known as risk-based capital. This system establishes the minimum amount of riskbased capital necessary for a company to support its overall business operations. It identifies property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized by evaluating certain inherent risks of each insurers assets and liabilities and its mix of net written premiums. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, including supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation. Failure to maintain our riskbased capital at the required levels could cause our insurance subsidiary to lose its regulatory authority to conduct its business. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of our risk-based capital as of December 31, 2007. 38 Table of Contents IRIS Ratios. The Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, is part of a collection of analytical tools designed to provide state insurance regulators with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies. IRIS has two phases of screening: statistical and analytical. In the statistical phase, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners database generates financial ratios based on financial information obtained from insurance companies annual statutory statements. The analytical phase is a review of the annual statements, financial ratios and other automated solvency tools. A ratio result falling outside the usual range of IRIS ratios is viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. As of December 31, 2007, Century had no IRIS ratios outside the usual range and PIC had two IRIS ratios outside the usual range, as described in Our Business  Regulatory Environment  IRIS Ratios, which could result in possible regulatory attention. We are subject to judicial decisions affecting insurance and tort law, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. State courts may render decisions impacting our liability for losses under insurance and tort law. This case law, as well as any legislation enacted in response, can impact the claim severity and frequency assumptions underlying our reserves. Accordingly, our ultimate liability may exceed our estimates due to this variable, among others. As a holding company, we are dependent on the results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries and the regulatory and contractual capacity of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. Some states limit the aggregate amount of dividends our subsidiaries may pay to us in any twelve-month period, thereby limiting our funds to pay expenses and dividends. We are an insurance holding company and our principal asset is the shares we hold in Century. Dividends and other payments from this company are our primary source of funds to pay expenses and dividends to our shareholders. The payment of dividends by Century to us is limited by statute. In general, these restrictions limit the aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions that Century may declare or pay within any twelve-month period without advance regulatory approval. Generally, this limitation is the greater of statutory net income for the preceding calendar year or 10% of the statutory surplus at the end of the preceding calendar year. In addition, insurance regulators have broad powers to prevent reduction of statutory surplus to inadequate levels and could refuse to permit the payment of dividends of the maximum amounts calculated under any applicable formula. As a result, we may not be able to receive dividends from our subsidiary at times and in amounts necessary to meet our debt service obligations or to pay dividends to our shareholders or corporate expenses. The amount of dividends that can be paid to us from Century in 2008 without regulatory approval is $27.4 million. Although we have paid cash dividends in the past, we may not pay cash dividends in the future. The declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. There is no requirement that we must, and we cannot assure you that we will, declare and pay any dividends in the future. Our board of directors may determine to retain such capital for general corporate or other purposes. If we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could be delayed or hindered. Our future success will depend, in large part, upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel. We rely substantially upon the services of Edward F. Feighan, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Erin E. West, our Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and Christopher J. Timm, our Executive Vice President and Director. Messrs. Feighan and Timm and Ms. West each have an employment agreement with us. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could cause our ability to implement our business strategies to be delayed or hindered. We do not have key person insurance on the lives of any of our key management personnel, except one officer. As we continue to grow, we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel, but we may not be able to do so. As we have grown, we have generally been successful in filling key positions, but our ability to continue to recruit and retain such personnel will depend upon a number of factors, 39 Table of Contents such as our results of operations, prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel. Managing technology initiatives and meeting new data security requirements present significant risks for us, which could lead to increased costs or business disruptions. While technological developments can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives can present short-term cost and implementation risks. In addition, projections of expenses, implementation schedules and utility of results my be inaccurate and can escalate over time. We rely on these systems to process new and renewal business, provide customer service, make claims payments and facilitate collections and cancellations, as well as to perform actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for pricing and product development. Failure to implement or maintain adequate systems could significantly increase our costs or cause us to lose business, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Data security is subject to increasing regulation. We face rising costs and competing time constraints in meeting compliance requirements of new and proposed regulations. The expanding volume and sophistication of computer viruses, hackers and other external hazards may increase the vulnerability of our data systems to security breaches. These increased risks and expanding regulatory requirement expose us to potential data loss and damages and significant increases in compliance and litigation costs. Our general agents may exceed their authority and bind us to policies outside our underwriting guidelines, and until we effect a cancellation, we may incur loss and loss expenses related to that policy. As of December 31, 2007, we underwrote 63.6% of our property and casualty premiums on a limited binding authority basis. Binding authority business represents risks that may be quoted and bound by our general agents prior to our underwriting review. If a general agent exceeds this authority by binding us to a risk that does not comply with our underwriting guidelines, we are at risk for claims under that policy that occur during the period from its issue date until we receive the policy and cancel it. To cancel a policy for exceeding underwriting authority, we must receive and cancel the policy within statutorily prescribed time limits that are dependent on the jurisdiction but are typically 60 days. Our general agents are required by contract to have bound policies issued and a copy sent to our office within 30 days of the effective date of coverage. Our policy review generally takes two to four weeks, depending on the time of year. Upon review of a policy, we issue instructions to cure any material errors we discover. If cancellation of the policy is the only cure, we order the cancellation of the policy at that time pursuant to state law. As a result, we may be bound by a policy that does not comply with our underwriting guidelines, and until we can effect a cancellation, we may incur loss and loss expenses related to that policy. Our reliance on our agents subjects us to credit risk. Our agents collect premiums from policyholders and forward them to us. In certain jurisdictions, when the insured pays premiums for these policies to agents for payment over to us, the premiums might be considered to have been paid under applicable insurance laws and regulations, and the insured will no longer be liable to us for these amounts, whether or not we actually receive the premiums from the agent. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with our agents. Although agents failures to remit premiums to us have not caused a material adverse impact on us to date, there have been instances where agents collected premiums and did not remit it to us and we were nonetheless required under applicable law to provide the coverage set forth in the policy despite the absence of premium. Because the possibility of these events is dependent in large part upon the financial condition of our agents, which is not publicly available, we are not able to quantify the exposure presented by this risk. If we are unable to collect premiums from our agents in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We continue to evaluate our internal controls systems to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit, our internal controls over financial reporting and to perform the system 40 Table of Contents and process evaluation and testing (and any necessary remediation) required to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In the course of this evaluation, we may identify control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity under applicable SEC and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board rules and regulations that remain unremediated. As a public company, we are required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness or changes in internal controls that, or are reasonably likely to, materially affect internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. If we cease to comply with the requirements of Section 404 manner, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the SEC or NASDAQ. Additionally, failure to comply with Section 404 or the report by us of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may be adversely affected. If we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may face restricted access to the capital markets, and your share price may be adversely affected. Item 1B.
