D. Risk Factors Any investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following factors, as well as the other information set forth in this annual report, before making an investment in our common stock. Some of the following risks relate principally to the industry in which we operate and our business in general. Other risks relate to the securities market for and ownership of our common stock. Any of the risk factors could significantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results and common stock price. The following risk factors describe the material risks that are presently known to us. Risk Factors Relating To Our Common Stock There may not be a liquid market for our shares, which may cause our shares to trade at lower prices and make it difficult to sell your shares. Although our shares trade on the Over The Counter Bulletin Board, or OTCBB, the trading volume is low. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our shares will develop or be sustained. We cannot predict at this time how actively our shares will trade in the public market or whether the price of our shares in the public market will reflect our actual financial performance. The price of our shares may be volatile and less than you originally paid for such shares. The price of our shares may be volatile, and may fluctuate due to factors such as: o actual or anticipated fluctuations in quarterly and annual results; o mergers and strategic alliances in the shipping industry; o market conditions in the industry; o changes in government regulation; o fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and earnings and those of our publicly held competitors; o shortfalls in our operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts; o announcements concerning us or our competitors; and o the general state of the securities markets. The international drybulk, containership and multipurpose shipping industries have been highly unpredictable and volatile. The market for common shares of companies in these industries may be equally volatile. Our shares may trade at prices lower than you originally paid for such shares. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent (1) our merger or acquisition and/or (2) the removal of incumbent directors and officers. Our current Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain certain anti-takeover provisions. These provisions include blank check preferred stock, the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors, a classified board of directors, advance written notice for shareholder nominations for directors, removal of directors only for cause, advance written notice of shareholder proposals for the removal of directors and limitations on action by shareholders. These provisions, either individually or in the aggregate, may discourage, delay or prevent (1) our merger or acquisition by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, that a shareholder may consider in its best interest and (2) the removal of incumbent directors and officers. Future sales of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, may depress the market price for our common stock. These sales could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities in the future. Pursuant to our F-1 registration statement, we registered for resale 7,026,993 shares of common stock, 1,756,743 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants and 818,604 shares of our common stock issued to certain affiliates of Cove Apparel, Inc., or Cove, in connection with the merger of Cove with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Euroseas Acquisition Company Inc. We have entered into a registration rights agreement with Friends Investment Company Inc. ("Friends"), our largest stockholder, pursuant to which we have granted Friends the right to require us to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, shares of our common stock held by it. Under the registration rights agreement, Friends has the right to request that we register the sale of shares held by it on its behalf and may require us to make available shelf registration statements permitting sales of shares into the market from time to time over an extended period. In addition, Friends has the ability to exercise certain piggyback registration rights in connection with registered offerings requested by stockholders or initiated by us. Registration of such shares under the Securities Act would, except for shares purchased by affiliates, result in such shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act immediately upon the effectiveness of such registration. In addition, shares not registered pursuant to the registration rights agreement may be resold pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including the exemptions provided by Rule 144 and Regulation S under the Securities Act. Industry Risk Factors The cyclical nature of the shipping industry may lead to volatile changes in freight rates which may reduce our revenues and net income. We are an independent shipping company that operates in the drybulk, containership and multipurpose shipping markets. Our profitability is dependent upon the freight rates we are able to charge. The supply of and demand for shipping capacity strongly influences freight rates. The demand for shipping capacity is determined primarily by the demand for the type of commodities carried and the distance that those commodities must be moved by sea. The demand for commodities is affected by, among other things, world and regional economic and political conditions (including developments in international trade, fluctuations in industrial and agricultural production and armed conflicts), environmental concerns, weather patterns, and changes in seaborne and other transportation costs. The size of the existing fleet in a particular market, the number of new vessel deliveries, the scrapping of older vessels and the number of vessels out of active service (i.e., laid-up, drydocked, awaiting repairs or otherwise not available for hire), determines the supply of shipping capacity, which is measured by the amount of suitable tonnage available to carry cargo. The cyclical nature of the shipping industry may lead to volatile changes in freight rates which may reduce our revenues and net income. In addition to the prevailing and anticipated freight rates, factors that affect the rate of newbuilding, scrapping and laying-up include newbuilding prices, secondhand vessel values in relation to scrap prices, costs of bunkers and other operating costs, costs associated with classification society surveys, normal maintenance and insurance coverage, the efficiency and age profile of the existing fleet in the market and government and industry regulation of maritime transportation practices, particularly environmental protection laws and regulations. These factors influencing the supply of and demand for shipping capacity are outside of our control, and we cannot predict the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions. Some of these factors may have a negative impact on our revenues and net income. The value of our vessels may fluctuate, adversely affecting our earnings, liquidity and causing it us breach our secured credit agreements. The market value of our vessels can fluctuate significantly. The market value of our vessels may increase or decrease depending on the following factors: o general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry; o supply of drybulk, containership and multipurpose vessels; o demand for drybulk, containership and multipurpose vessels; o types and sizes of vessels; o other modes of transportation; o cost of newbuildings; o new regulatory requirements from governments or self-regulated organizations; and o prevailing level of charter rates. As vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. Due to the cyclical nature of the drybulk and containership and multipurpose vessel markets, if for any reason we sell vessels at a time when prices have fallen, we could incur a loss and our business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition and ability to pay dividends could be adversely affected. Due to the fact that the market value of our vessels may fluctuate significantly, we may incur losses when we sell vessels, which may adversely affect our earnings. In addition, any determination that a vessel's remaining useful life and earnings requires an impairment of its value on our financial statements could result in a charge against our earnings and a reduction in our shareholders' equity. Any change in the assessed value of any of our vessels might cause a violation of the covenants of each secured credit agreement which in turn might restrict our cash and affect our liquidity. All of our credit agreements provide for a minimum security maintenance ratio. If the assessed value of our vessels declines below certain thresholds, we will be deemed to have violated these covenants and may incur penalties for breach of our credit agreements. For example, these penalties could require us to prepay the shortfall between the assessed value of our vessels and the value such vessels are required to maintain pursuant to the secured credit agreement, or to provide additional security acceptable to the lenders in an amount at least equal to the amount of any shortfall. Further, future loans that we may agree to may include various other covenants, in addition to the vessel-related ones, that may ultimately depend on the assessed values of our vessels. Such covenants include, but are not limited to, maximum fleet leverage covenants and minimum fair net worth covenants. If for any reason we sell our vessels at a time when prices have fallen, the sale may be less than such vessel's carrying amount on our financial statements, and we would incur a loss and a reduction in earnings. Although charter rates in the international shipping industry reached historic highs recently, future profitability will be dependent on the level of charter rates and commodity prices. Charter rates for the international shipping industry have reached record highs during the past year; however, recently rates have declined. We anticipate that the future demand for our drybulk carriers, containership and multipurpose vessels and the charter rates of the corresponding markets will be dependent upon continued economic growth in China, India and the world economy, seasonal and regional changes in demand, and changes to the capacity of the world fleet. The capacity of the world fleet seems likely to increase and there can be no assurance that economic growth will continue. Adverse economic, political, social or other developments could also have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If the number of new ships delivered exceeds the number of vessels being scrapped and lost, vessel capacity will increase. For instance, given that as of the end of 2005 the capacity of the worldwide container vessel fleet was approximately 8.1 million teu, with approximately 4.4 million teu of additional capacity on order, the growing supply of container vessels may exceed future demand, particularly in the short term. If the supply of vessel capacity increases but the demand for vessel capacity does not increase correspondingly, charter rates and vessel values could materially decline. The factors affecting the supply and demand for vessels are outside of our control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable. Some of the factors that influence demand for vessel capacity include: o supply and demand for drybulk and containership commodities, and separately for containerized cargo; o global and regional economic conditions; o the distance drybulk and containerized commodities are to be moved by sea; o changes in global production and manufacturing distribution patterns of finished goods that utilize drybulk and other containerized commodities; and o changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns. Some of the factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include: o the number of newbuilding deliveries; o the scrapping rate of older vessels; o changes in environmental and other regulations that may limit the useful life of vessels; and o the number of vessels that are laid up. An economic slowdown in the Asia Pacific region could materially reduce the amount and/or profitability of our business. A significant number of the port calls made by our vessels involve the loading or discharging of raw materials and semi-finished products in ports in the Asia Pacific region. As a result, a negative change in economic conditions in any Asia Pacific country, but particularly in China or India, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, as well as our future prospects. In particular, in recent years, China has been one of the world's fastest growing economies in terms of gross domestic product. We cannot assure you that such growth will be sustained or that the Chinese economy will not experience contraction in the future. Moreover, any slowdown in the economies of the United States of America, the European Union or certain Asian countries may adversely effect economic growth in China and elsewhere. Our business, financial position and results of operations, as well as our future prospects, will likely be materially and adversely affected by an economic downturn in any of these countries. We may become dependent on spot charters in the volatile shipping markets, which can result in decreased revenues and/or profitability. Although most of our vessels are currently under longer term time charters, in the future, we may have more of these vessels and/or any newly acquired vessels on spot charters. The spot charter market is highly competitive and rates within this market are subject to volatile fluctuations, while longer-term time charters provide income at pre-determined rates over more extended periods of time. If we decide to spot charter our vessels, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in keeping all our vessels fully employed in these short-term markets or that future spot rates will be sufficient to enable our vessels to be operated profitably. A significant decrease in charter rates could affect the value of our fleet and could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows with the result that our ability to pay debt service to our lenders and dividends to our shareholders could be impaired. We are subject to regulation and liability under environmental laws that could require significant expenditures and affect our cash flows and net income. Our business and the operation of our vessels are materially affected by government regulation in the form of international conventions, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which the vessels operate, as well as in the country or countries of their registration. Because such conventions, laws, and regulations are often revised, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with such conventions, laws and regulations or the impact thereof on the resale prices or useful lives of our vessels. Additional conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of our doing business and which may materially adversely affect our operations. We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. The operation of our vessels is affected by the requirements set forth in the International Maritime Organization's ("IMO's") International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and Pollution Prevention ("ISM Code"). The ISM Code requires shipowners and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive "Safety Management System" that includes the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation and describing procedures for dealing with emergencies. The failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject such party to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels, and/or may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. Currently, each of our vessels and Eurobulk Ltd., or Eurobulk, an affiliate and our ship management company, are ISM Code-certified, however, there can be no assurance that such certification will be maintained indefinitely. Although the United States of America is not a party, many countries have ratified and follow the liability scheme adopted by the IMO and set out in the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended (the "CLC"), and the Convention for the Establishment of an International Fund for Oil Pollution of 1971, as amended. Under these conventions, a vessel's registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused on the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain complete defenses. Many of the countries that have ratified the CLC have increased the liability limits through a 1992 Protocol to the CLC. The right to limit liability is also forfeited under the CLC where the spill is caused by the owner's actual fault or privity and, under the 1992 Protocol, where the spill is caused by the owner's intentional or reckless conduct. Vessels trading to contracting states must provide evidence of insurance covering the limited liability of the owner. In jurisdictions where the CLC has not been adopted, various legislative schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to the CLC. The United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA") established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and clean-up of the environment from oil spills. OPA affects all owners and operators whose vessels trade in the United States of America or any of its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in waters of the United States of America, which includes the territorial sea of the United States of America and its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. OPA allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault of vessel owners, operators and bareboat charterers for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels, including bunkers (fuel), in the U.S. waters. OPA also expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution materials occurring within their boundaries. While we do not carry oil as cargo, we do carry fuel oil (bunkers) in our drybulk carriers. We currently maintain, for each of our vessels, pollution liability coverage insurance of $1 billion per incident. If the damages from a catastrophic spill exceeded our insurance coverage, that would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition. Capital expenditures and other costs necessary to operate and maintain our vessels may increase due to changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards. Changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards, as well as compliance with standards imposed by maritime self-regulatory organizations and customer requirements or competition, may require us to make additional expenditures. In order to satisfy these requirements, we may, from time to time, be required to take our vessels out of service for extended periods of time, with corresponding losses of revenues. In the future, market conditions may not justify these expenditures or enable us to operate some or all of our vessels profitably during the remainder of their economic lives. Increased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business. International shipping is subject to various security and customs inspection and related procedures in countries of origin and destination. Inspection procedures can result in the seizure of contents of our vessels, delays in the loading, offloading or delivery and the levying of customs duties, fines or other penalties against us. It is possible that changes to inspection procedures could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us. Furthermore, changes to inspection procedures could also impose additional costs and obligations on our customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment of certain types of cargo uneconomical or impractical. Any such changes or developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Rising fuel prices may adversely affect our profits. Fuel (bunkers) is a significant, if not the largest, operating expense for many of our shipping operations when our vessels are under voyage charter. When a vessel is operating under a time charter, these costs are paid by the charterer. However fuel costs are taken into account by the charterer in determining the amount of time charter hire and therefore fuel costs also indirectly affect time charters. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Fuel prices have been at historically high levels recently, but shipowners have not really felt the effect of these high prices because the shipping markets have also been at high levels. Any increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our profitability. Further, fuel may become much more expensive in future, which may reduce the profitability and competitiveness of our business versus other forms of transportation, such as truck or rail. If our vessels fail to maintain their class certification and/or fail any annual survey, intermediate survey, drydocking or special survey, that vessel would be unable to carry cargo, thereby reducing our revenues and profitability and violating certain loan covenants of our third-party indebtedness. The hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the Safety of Life at Sea Convention ("SOLAS"). Our vessels are currently classed with Lloyd's Register of Shipping, Bureau Veritas and Nippon Kaiji Kyokai. ISM and International Ship and Port Facilities Security ("ISPS") certification have been awarded by Bureau Veritas and the Panama Maritime Authority to our vessels and Eurobulk. A vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys, drydockings and special surveys. In lieu of a special survey, a vessel's machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Every vessel is also required to be drydocked every two to three years for inspection of the underwater parts of such vessel. If any vessel does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey, drydocking or special survey, the vessel will be unable to carry cargo between ports and will be unemployable and uninsurable which could cause us to be in violation of certain covenants in our loan agreements. Any such inability to carry cargo or be employed, or any such violation of covenants, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. That status could cause us to be in violation of certain covenants in our loan agreements. Maritime claimants could arrest our vessels, which could interrupt our cash flow. Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lienholder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arresting or attachment of one or more of our vessels could interrupt our cash flow and require us to pay large sums of funds to have the arrest lifted which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the "sister ship" theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel which is subject to the claimant's maritime lien and any "associated" vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert "sister ship" liability against one of our vessels for claims relating to another of our vessels. Governments could requisition our vessels during a period of war or emergency, resulting in loss of earnings. A government could requisition for title or seize our vessels. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner. Also, a government could requisition our vessels for hire. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. Government requisition of one or more of our vessels could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. World events outside our control may negatively affect our ability to operate, thereby reducing our revenues and net income or our ability to obtain additional financing, thereby restricting the implementation of our business strategy. Terrorist attacks such as the attacks on the United States of America on September 11, 2001, on London, England on July 7, 2005, and the response to these attacks, as well as the threat of future terrorist attacks, continue to cause uncertainty in the world financial markets and may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The continuing conflict in Iraq may lead to additional acts of terrorism and armed conflict around the world, which may contribute to further economic instability in the global financial markets. These uncertainties could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our operations and financial condition and directly impact its vessels or its customers. Future terrorist attacks could result in increased volatility of the financial markets in the United States of America and globally and could result in an economic recession in the United States of America or the world. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and costs. Company Risk Factors We depend entirely on Eurobulk to manage and charter our fleet. We currently contract the commercial and technical management of our fleet, including crewing, maintenance and repair, to Eurobulk, an affiliated company with which we are under common control. The loss of Eurobulk's services or its failure to perform its obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operations. Although we may have rights against Eurobulk if it defaults on its obligations to us, you will have no recourse against Eurobulk. Further, we expect that we will need to seek approval from our lenders to change Eurobulk as our ship manager. Because Eurobulk is a privately held company, there is little or no publicly available information about it and we may get very little advance warning of operational or financial problems experienced by Eurobulk that may adversely affect us. The ability of Eurobulk to continue providing services for our benefit will depend in part on its own financial strength. Circumstances beyond our control could impair Eurobulk's financial strength. Because Eurobulk is privately held it is unlikely that information about its financial strength would become public unless Eurobulk began to default on its obligations. As a result, there may be little advance warning of problems affecting Eurobulk, even though these problems could have a material adverse effect on us. We and our principal officers have affiliations with Eurobulk that could create conflicts of interest detrimental to us. Our principal officers are also principals, officers and employees of Eurobulk, which is our ship management company. These responsibilities and relationships could create conflicts of interest between us and Eurobulk. Conflicts may also arise in connection with the chartering, purchase, sale and operations of the vessels in our fleet versus drybulk carriers that may be managed in the future by Eurobulk. Circumstances in any of these instances may make one decision advantageous to us but detrimental to Eurobulk and vice versa. Eurobulk does not presently manage any vessels other than those owned by Euroseas. In the past, Eurobulk has managed vessels where the Pittas family was a minority shareholder but never any where there was no Pittas family participation at all. There have never been any conflicts of interest that were resolved in a manner unfavorable to Euroseas or its predecessors. However, it is possible that in the future Eurobulk may manage vessels which will not belong to Euroseas and in which the Pittas family may have controlling, little or even no power or participation and where such conflicts may arise. There can be no assurance that Eurobulk will resolve all conflicts of interest in a manner beneficial to us. We are a holding company, and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy our financial obligations or to make dividend payments. We are a holding company and our subsidiaries, which are all wholly-owned by us either directly or indirectly, conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets. We have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our wholly-owned subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to make dividend payments to you depends on our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we may be unable or our Board of Directors may exercise its discretion not to pay dividends. We may not be able to pay dividends. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we currently intend to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, we may incur other expenses or liabilities that would reduce or eliminate the cash available for distribution as dividends. Our loan agreements may also limit the amount of dividends we can pay under some circumstances based on certain covenants included in the loan agreements. Over the period January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005, we paid substantially all of our net income as dividends usually on an annual basis, but quarterly since our private placement in August 2005, without having been restricted by our loan agreements. If we are not successful in acquiring additional vessels, any unused net proceeds from our recent private placement offering may be used for other corporate purposes or held pending investment in other vessels. Identifying and acquiring vessels may take a significant amount time. The result may be that proceeds of the offering are not invested in additional vessels, or are so invested but only after some delay. In either case, we will not be able to earn charterhire consistent with our current anticipations, and our profitability and our ability to pay dividends will be affected. In addition, the declaration and payment of dividends will be subject at all times to the discretion of our Board of Directors. The timing and amount of dividends will depend on our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, restrictions in our loan agreements, growth strategy, the provisions of Marshall Islands law affecting the payment of dividends and other factors. Marshall Islands law generally prohibits the payment of dividends other than from surplus or while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent upon the payment of such dividends. However, there can be no assurance that dividends will be paid. Companies affiliated with Eurobulk or our officers and directors may acquire vessels that compete with our fleet. Companies affiliated with Eurobulk or our officers and directors own drybulk carriers and may acquire additional drybulk carriers in the future. These vessels could be in competition with our fleet and other companies affiliated with Eurobulk might be faced with conflicts of interest with respect to their own interests and their obligations to us. If we are unable to fund our capital expenditures, we may not be able to continue to operate some of our vessels, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to pay dividends. In order to fund our capital expenditures, we may be required to incur borrowings or raise capital through the sale of debt or equity securities. Our ability to access the capital markets through future offerings may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such offering as well as by adverse market conditions resulting from, among other things, general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Our failure to obtain the funds for necessary future capital expenditures would limit our ability to continue to operate some of our vessels and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends. Even if we are successful in obtaining such funds through financings, the terms of such financings could further limit our ability to pay dividends. If we fail to manage our planned growth properly, we may not be able to successfully expand our market share. We intend to continue to grow our fleet. Our growth will depend on: o locating and acquiring suitable vessels; o identifying and consummating acquisitions or joint ventures; o integrating any acquired business successfully with our existing operations; o enhancing our customer base; o managing our expansion; and o obtaining required financing. Growing any business by acquisition presents numerous risks, such as undisclosed liabilities and obligations and difficulty experienced in (1) obtaining additional qualified personnel, (2) managing relationships with customers and suppliers and (3) integrating newly acquired operations into existing infrastructures. We cannot give any assurance that we will be successful in executing our growth plans or that we will not incur significant expenses and losses in connection with the execution of those growth plans. A decline in the market value of our vessels could lead to a default under our loan agreements and the loss of our vessels. We have incurred secured debt under loan agreements for our vessels and currently expect to incur additional secured debt in connection with our acquisition of other vessels. If the market value of our fleet declines, we may not be in compliance with certain provisions of our existing loan agreements and we may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing. If we are unable to pledge additional collateral, our lenders could accelerate our debt and foreclose on our fleet. Our existing loan agreements contain restrictive covenants that may limit our liquidity and corporate activities. Our existing loan agreements impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may limit our ability to: o incur additional indebtedness; o create liens on our assets; o sell capital stock of our subsidiaries; o make investments; o engage in mergers or acquisitions; o pay dividends; o make capital expenditures; o change the management of our vessels or terminate or materially amend the management agreement relating to each vessel; and o sell our vessels. Therefore, we may need to seek permission from our lenders in order to engage in some corporate actions. The lenders' interests may be different from our interests, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the lenders' permission when needed. This may prevent us from taking actions that are in our best interest. Servicing future debt would limit funds available for other purposes. To finance our fleet, we have incurred secured debt under loan agreements for our vessels. We also currently expect to incur additional secured debt to finance the acquisition of additional vessels. We must dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest on our debt. These payments limit funds otherwise available for working capital expenditures and other purposes. As of May 31, 2006, we had total bank debt of approximately $40.62 million. If we were unable to service our debt, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A rise in interest rates could cause an increase in our costs and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have purchased, and may purchase in the future, vessels under loan agreements that provide for periodic interest payments based on indices that fluctuate with changes in market interest rates. If interest rates increase significantly, it would increase our costs of financing our acquisition of vessels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any increase in debt service would also reduce the funds available to us to purchase other vessels. Our ability to obtain additional debt financing may be dependent on the performance of our then existing charters and the creditworthiness of our charterers. The actual or perceived credit quality of our charterers, and any defaults by them, may materially affect our ability to obtain the additional debt financing that we will require to purchase additional vessels or may significantly increase our costs of obtaining such financing. Our inability to obtain additional financing at all or at a higher than anticipated cost may materially affect our results of operation and our ability to implement our business strategy. As we expand our business, we may need to upgrade our operations and financial systems, and add more staff and crew. If we cannot upgrade these systems or recruit suitable employees, our performance may be adversely affected. Our current operating and financial systems may not be adequate if we expand the size of our fleet, and our attempts to improve those systems may be ineffective. In addition, if we expand our fleet, we will have to rely on Eurobulk to recruit suitable additional seafarers and shoreside administrative and management personnel. We cannot assure you that Eurobulk will be able to continue to hire suitable employees as we expand our fleet. If Eurobulk's unaffiliated crewing agent encounters business or financial difficulties, we may not be able to adequately staff our vessels. If we are unable to operate our financial and operations systems effectively or to recruit suitable employees, our performance may be materially adversely affected. Because we obtain some of our insurance through protection and indemnity associations, we may also be subject to calls in amounts based not only on our own claim records, but also the claim records o f other members of the protection and indemnity associations. We may be subject to calls in amounts based not only on our claim records but also the claim records of other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive insurance coverage for tort liability, including pollution-related liability. Our payment of these calls could result in significant expense to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends. Labor interruptions could disrupt our business. Our vessels are manned by masters, officers and crews that are employed by third parties. If not resolved in a timely and cost-effective manner, industrial action or other labor unrest could prevent or hinder our operations from being carried out normally and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends. In the highly competitive international drybulk, containership and multipurpose shipping industry, we may not be able to compete for charters with new entrants or established companies with greater resources. We employ our vessels in a highly competitive market that is capital intensive and highly fragmented. Competition arises primarily from other vessel owners, some of whom have substantially greater resources than us. Competition for the transportation of drybulk and containership cargoes can be intense and depends on price, location, size, age, condition and the acceptability of the vessel and its managers to the charterers. Due in part to the highly fragmented market, competitors with greater resources could operate larger fleets through consolidations or acquisitions that may be able to offer better prices and fleets. We may be unable to attract and retain key management personnel and other employees in the shipping industry, which may negatively affect the effectiveness of our management and our results of operations. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of our management team. Our success will depend upon our ability to hire additional employees and to retain key members of our management team. The loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition. Difficulty in hiring and retaining personnel could adversely affect our results of operations. We do not currently intend to maintain "key man" life insurance on any of our officers. Risks involved with operating ocean going vessels could affect our business and reputation, which may reduce our revenues. The operation of an ocean-going vessel carries inherent risks. These risks include, among others, the possibility of: o crew strikes and/or boycotts; o marine disaster; o piracy; o environmental accidents; o cargo and property losses or damage; and o business interruptions caused by mechanical failure, human error, war, terrorism, political action in various countries, labor strikes or adverse weather conditions. The involvement of any of the vessels in an environmental disaster may harm our reputation as a safe and reliable vessel operator. Any of these circumstances or events could increase our costs or lower our revenues. Our vessels may suffer damage and it may face unexpected drydocking costs, which could affect our cash flow and financial condition. If our vessels suffer damage, they may need to be repaired at a drydocking facility. The costs of drydock repairs are unpredictable and can be substantial. We may have to pay drydocking costs that our insurance does not cover. The loss of earnings while these vessels are being repaired and reconditioned, as well as the actual cost of these repairs, would decrease our earnings. Purchasing and operating previously owned, or secondhand, vessels may result in increased operating costs and vessels off-hire, which could adversely affect our earnings. Although we inspect the secondhand vessels prior to purchase, this inspection does not provide us with the same knowledge about their condition and cost of any required (or anticipated) repairs that it would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us. Generally, we do not receive the benefit of warranties on secondhand vessels. In general, the costs to maintain a vessel in good operating condition increase with the age of the vessel. Older vessels are typically less fuel efficient and more costly to maintain than more recently constructed vessels. Cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a vessel, making older vessels less desirable to charterers. Governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards related to the age of vessels may require expenditures for alterations, or the addition of new equipment, to our vessels and may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage. We cannot assure you that, as our vessels age, market conditions will justify those expenditures or enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives. If we sell vessels, we are not certain that the price for which we sell them will equal their carrying amount at that time. We may not have adequate insurance to compensate us adequately for damage to, or loss of, our vessels. We procure hull and machinery insurance, protection and indemnity insurance, which includes environmental damage and pollution insurance and war risk insurance and freight, demurrage and defence insurance for our fleet. We do not maintain insurance against loss of hire, which covers business interruptions that result in the loss of use of a vessel. We can give no assurance that we are adequately insured against all risks. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for our fleet in the future. The insurers may not pay particular claims. Our insurance policies contain deductibles for which we will be responsible and limitations and exclusions which may increase our costs or lower our revenue. Moreover, we cannot assure that the insurers will not default on any claims they are required to pay. If our insurance is not enough to cover claims that may arise, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our operations outside the United States of America expose it to risks of mining, terrorism and piracy that may interfere with the operation of our vessels. We are an international company and primarily conducts our operations outside the United States of America. Changing economic, political and governmental conditions in the countries where we are engaged in business or where our vessels are registered affect our operations. In the past, political conflicts, particularly in the Arabian Gulf, resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt shipping in the area. Acts of terrorism and piracy have also affected vessels trading in regions such as the South China Sea. The likelihood of future acts of terrorism may increase, and our vessels may face higher risks of being attacked. We are not fully insured against any of these risks. In addition, future hostilities or other political instability in regions where our vessels trade could have a material adverse effect on our trade patterns and adversely affect our operations and performance. Because the Republic of the Marshall Islands, where we are incorporated, does not have a well-developed body of corporate law, shareholders may have fewer rights and protections than under typical United States law, such as Delaware, and shareholders may have difficulty in protecting their interest with regard to actions taken by our Board of Directors. Our corporate affairs are governed by our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and by the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act (the "BCA"). The provisions of the BCA resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the United States of America. However, there have been few judicial cases in the Republic of the Marshall Islands interpreting the BCA. The rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under the law of the Republic of the Marshall Islands are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain jurisdictions in the United States of America. Shareholder rights may differ as well. For example, under Marshall Islands law, a copy of the notice of any meeting of the shareholders must be given not less than 15 days before the meeting, whereas in Delaware such notice must be given not less than 10 days before the meeting. Therefore, if immediate shareholder action is required, a meeting may not be able to be convened as quickly as it can be convened under Delaware law. Also, under Marshall Islands law, any action required to be taken by a meeting of shareholders may only be taken without a meeting if consent is in writing and is signed by all of the shareholders entitled to vote, whereas under Delaware law action may be taken by consent if approved by the number of shareholders that would be required to approve such action at a meeting. Therefore, under Marshall Islands law, it may be more difficult for a company to take certain actions without a meeting even if a majority of the shareholders approve of such action. While the BCA does specifically incorporate the non-statutory law, or judicial case law, of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions by the management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States of America. Obligations associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the other rules and regulations of the SEC, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We have to dedicate a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with these regulatory requirements. Our common stock is listed on the OTCBB under the symbol ESEAF.OB and we are subject to the rules and regulations of the OTCBB. We have applied to list our common stock on the NASDAQ National Market and, if approved, will be subject to the listing requirements of the NASDAQ National Market. We cannot assure you that such listing will be obtained. We work with our legal, accounting and financial advisors to identify any areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. We evaluate areas such as corporate governance, corporate control, internal audit, disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems. We will make changes in any of these and other areas, including our internal control over financial reporting, which we believe are necessary. However, these and other measures we may take may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely and reliable basis. In addition, compliance with reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies will create additional costs for us and will require the time and attention of management. Our limited management resources may exacerbate the difficulties in complying with these reporting and other requirements while focusing on executing our business strategy. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur, the timing of such costs or the degree of impact that our management's attention to these matters will have on our business. Our historical financial and operating data may not be representative of our future results because we are a recently formed company with no operating history as a stand-alone entity or as a publicly traded company. Our historical financial and operating data may not be representative of our future results because we are a recently formed company with no operating history as a stand-alone entity or as a publicly traded company. Our combined financial statements included in this annual report have been carved out of the consolidated financial statements of shipowning companies managed by Eurobulk and majority owned by the Pittas family. Consistent with shipping industry practice, we have not obtained, nor do we present in this annual report, historical operating data for our vessels prior to their acquisition. Although our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition reflected in we have combined financial statements include all expenses allocable to our business, due to factors such as the additional administrative and financial obligations associated with operating as a publicly traded company, they may not be indicative of the results of operations that we would have achieved had we operated as a public entity for all periods presented or of future results that we may achieve as a publicly traded company with our current holding company structure. We depend upon a few significant charterers for a large part of our revenues. The loss of one or more of these charterers could adversely affect our financial performance. We have historically derived a significant part of our revenue from a small number of charterers. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 65% of our total revenues for 2005, 68% of our total revenues for 2004 and 54% of our total revenues for 2003. If we lose any of these charterers, or if any of these charterers significantly reduce its use of our services or was unable to make charter payments to us, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition would be adversely affected. Exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations will result in fluctuations in our cash flows and operating results. We generate all our revenues in U.S. dollars, but our ship manager, Eurobulk, incurs approximately 30% of vessel operating expenses and we incur general and administrative expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This difference could lead to fluctuations in our vessel operating expenses, which would affect our financial results. Expenses incurred in foreign currencies increase when the value of the U.S. dollar falls, which would reduce our profitability. We do not currently engage in hedging transactions to minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations, but we may do so in the future. U.S. tax authorities could treat us as a "passive foreign investment company," which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders. A foreign corporation will be treated as a "passive foreign investment company," or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of "passive income" or (2) at least 50% of the average value of the corporation's assets produce or are held for the production of those types of "passive income." For purposes of these tests, "passive income" includes dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the performance of services does not constitute "passive income." U.S. shareholders of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U.S. federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions they receive from the PFIC and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC. Based on our proposed method of operation, we do not believe that we will be a PFIC with respect to any taxable year. In this regard, we intend to treat the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time chartering activities as services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, we believe that our income from our time chartering activities does not constitute "passive income," and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income do not constitute passive assets. There is, however, no direct legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our proposed method of operation. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or a court of law will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we would not constitute a PFIC for any future taxable year if there were to be changes in the nature and extent of our operations. If the IRS were to find that we are or have been a PFIC for any taxable year, our U.S. shareholders will face adverse U.S. tax consequences. Under the PFIC rules, unless those shareholders make an election available under the Code (which election could itself have adverse consequences for such shareholders, as discussed below under "Tax Considerations -- U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders"), such shareholders would be liable to pay U.S. federal income tax at the then prevailing income tax rates on ordinary income plus interest upon excess distributions and upon any gain from the disposition of our common shares, as if the excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder's holding period of our common shares. See "Tax Considerations - -- U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders" for a more comprehensive discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders if we are treated as a PFIC. We may have to pay tax on United States source income, which would reduce our earnings. Under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code, 50% of the gross shipping income of a vessel owning or chartering corporation, such as ourselves and our subsidiaries, that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States may be subject to a 4% United States federal income tax without allowance for deduction, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under section 883 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations recently promulgated thereunder. We expect that we and each of our subsidiaries qualify for this statutory tax exemption and we will take this position for United States federal income tax return reporting purposes. However, there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause us to lose the benefit of this tax exemption after the offering and thereby become subject to United States federal income tax on our United States source income. Due to the factual nature of the issues involved, we can give no assurances on our tax-exempt status or that of any of our subsidiaries. If we or our subsidiaries are not entitled to exemption under Section 883 for any taxable year, we or our subsidiaries could be subject for those years to an effective 2% United States federal income tax on the shipping income these companies derive during the year that are attributable to the transport or cargoes to or from the United States. The imposition of this taxation would have a negative effect on our business and would result in decreased earnings available for distribution to our shareholders.
