Item 1A. RISK FACTORS. The following are some of the factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also harm our business. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any such additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We depend on government contracts for substantially all of our revenues and the loss of government contracts or a delay or decline in funding of existing or future government contracts could adversely affect our sales and cash flows and our ability to fund our growth. Our revenues from contracts, directly or indirectly, with foreign and United States, state, regional and local governmental agencies represented more than 95% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2010. Although these various government agencies are subject to common budgetary pressures and other factors, many of our various government customers exercise independent purchasing decisions. Because of the concentration of business with governmental agencies, we are vulnerable to adverse changes in our revenues, income and cash flows if a significant number of our government contracts or subcontracts or prospects are delayed or canceled for budgetary or other reasons. 11 The factors that could cause us to lose these contracts or could otherwise materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations include: · re-allocation of government resources as the result of actual or threatened terrorism or hostile activities or for other reasons; · budget constraints affecting government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies such as U.S. or foreign defense and transit agencies and regional transit agencies, and changes in fiscal policies or a reduction of available funding; · Disruptions in our customers ability to access funding from capital markets; · curtailment of governments use of outsourced service providers; · the adoption of new laws or regulations pertaining to government procurement; · government appropriations delays or shutdowns; · suspension or prohibition from contracting with the government or any significant agency with which we conduct business; · impairment of our reputation or relationships with any significant government agency with which we conduct business; · impairment of our ability to provide third-party guarantees and letters of credit; and · delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices. Government spending priorities may change in a manner adverse to our businesses. In the past, our businesses have been adversely affected by significant changes in government spending during periods of declining budgets. A significant decline in overall spending, or the decision not to exercise options to renew contracts, or the loss of or substantial decline in spending on a large program in which we participate could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. As an example, the U.S. defense and national security budgets generally, and spending in specific agencies with which we work, such as the Department of Defense, have declined from time to time for extended periods since the 1980s, resulting in program delays, program cancellations and a slowing of new program starts. Although spending on defense-related programs by the U.S. government has increased in recent years, future levels of expenditures and authorizations for those programs may decrease, remain constant or shift to programs in areas where we do not currently provide products or services. Even though our contract periods of performance for a program may exceed one year, Congress must usually approve funds for a given program each fiscal year and may significantly reduce funding of a program in a particular year. Significant reductions in these appropriations or the amount of new defense contracts awarded may affect our ability to complete contracts, obtain new work and grow our business. Congress does not always enact spending bills by the beginning of the new fiscal year. Such delays leave the affected agencies under-funded which delays their ability to contract. Future delays and uncertainties in funding could impose additional business risks on us. Our contracts with government agencies may be terminated or modified prior to completion, which could adversely affect our business. Government contracts typically contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government agencies rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including providing the government agency with the ability to unilaterally: · terminate our existing contracts; · reduce the value of our existing contracts; · modify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts; 12 · suspend or permanently prohibit us from doing business with the government or with any specific government agency; · control and potentially prohibit the export of our products; · cancel or delay existing multiyear contracts and related orders if the necessary funds for contract performance for any subsequent year are not appropriated; · decline to exercise an option to extend an existing multiyear contract; and · claim rights in technologies and systems invented, developed or produced by us. Most U.S. government agencies and some other agencies with which we contract can terminate their contracts with us for convenience, and in that event we generally may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. If an agency terminates a contract with us for default, we are denied any recovery and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the agency in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source. We may receive show-cause or cure notices under contracts that, if not addressed to the agencys satisfaction, could give the agency the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts. In the event that any of our contracts were to be terminated or adversely modified, there may be significant adverse effects on our revenues, operating costs and income that would not be recoverable. Failure to retain existing contracts or win new contracts under competitive bidding processes may adversely affect our revenue. We obtain most of our contracts through a competitive bidding process, and substantially all of the business that we expect to seek in the foreseeable future likely will be subject to a competitive bidding process. Competitive bidding presents a number of risks, including: · the need to compete against companies or teams of companies with more financial and marketing resources and more experience in bidding on and performing major contracts than we have; · the need to compete against companies or teams of companies that may be long-term, entrenched incumbents for a particular contract for which we are competing and that have, as a result, greater domain expertise and better customer relations; · the need to compete to retain existing contracts that have in the past been awarded to us on a sole-source basis; · the U.S. Governments increased emphasis on awarding contracts to small businesses could preclude us from bidding on certain work or reduce the scope of work we can bid as a prime contractor; · the expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge new contract awards; · the need to bid on some programs in advance of the completion of their design, which may result in higher research and development expenditures, unforeseen technological difficulties, or increased costs which lower our profitability; · the substantial cost and managerial time and effort, including design, development and marketing activities, necessary to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us; · the need to develop, introduce, and implement new and enhanced solutions to our customers needs; · the need to locate and contract with teaming partners and subcontractors; and · the need to accurately estimate the resources and cost structure that will be required to perform any fixed-price contract that we are awarded. 13 We may not be afforded the opportunity in the future to bid on contracts that are held by other companies and are scheduled to expire if the agency decides to extend the existing contract. If we are unable to win particular contracts that are awarded through the competitive bidding process, we may not be able to operate in the market for services that are provided under those contracts for a number of years. If we win a contract, and upon expiration, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process and there can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract. Because of the complexity and scheduling of contracting with government agencies, we occasionally incur costs before receiving contractual funding by the government agency. In some circumstances, we may not be able to recover these costs in whole or in part under subsequent contractual actions. If we are unable to consistently retain existing contracts or win new contract awards, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. The U.S. Governments increased emphasis on awarding contracts to small businesses could increase the number of contracts we receive as a subcontractor to small businesses. Some of these small businesses may not be financially sound, which could adversely affect our business. There has been an increased emphasis by the U.S. government recently on awarding contracts to small businesses which may preclude companies the size of ours from obtaining certain work, other than as a subcontractor to these small businesses. There are inherent risks in contracting with small companies that may not have the capability or financial resources to perform these contracts or administer them correctly. If a small business with which we have a subcontract fails to perform, fails to bill the government properly or fails financially, we may have difficulty receiving timely payments or may incur bad debt write-offs if the small business is unable or unwilling to pay us for work we perform. This could result in significant adverse effects on our revenues, operating costs and cash flows. Government audits of our contracts could result in a material charge to our earnings and have a negative effect on our cash position following an audit adjustment. Many of our government contracts are subject to cost audits which may occur several years after the period to which the audit relates. If an audit identifies significant unallowable costs, we could incur a material charge to our earnings or reduction in our cash position. Our international business exposes us to additional risks, including exchange rate fluctuations, foreign tax and legal regulations and political or economic instability that could harm our operating results. Our international operations subject us to risks associated with operating in and selling products or services in foreign countries, including: · devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; · changes in foreign laws that adversely affect our ability to sell our products or services or our ability to repatriate profits to the United States; · increases or impositions of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures to us; · increases in investment and other restrictions or requirements by foreign governments in order to operate in the territory or own the subsidiary; · costs of compliance with local laws, including labor laws; · export control regulations and policies which govern our ability to supply foreign customers; · unfamiliar and unknown business practices and customs; · domestic and foreign government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation requirements; · the complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives and consultants or being prohibited from such use; · the uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases; · imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions; 14 · the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise in various countries; and · economic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including international hostilities, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, trade relationships and military and political alliances. Our foreign subsidiaries generally conduct business in foreign currencies and enter into contracts and make purchase commitments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We have no control over the factors that generally affect this risk, such as economic, financial and political events and the supply of and demand for applicable currencies. While we use foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge significant contract sales and purchase commitments that are denominated in foreign currencies, our hedging strategy may not prevent us from incurring losses due to exchange fluctuations. Our operating margins may decline under our fixed-price contracts if we fail to estimate accurately the time and resources necessary to satisfy our obligations. Approximately 73% of our revenues in 2010 were from fixed-price contracts under which we bear the risk of cost overruns. Our profits are adversely affected if our costs under these contracts exceed the assumptions we used in bidding for the contract. Sometimes we are required to fix the price for a contract before the project specifications are finalized, which increases the risk that we will incorrectly price these contracts. The complexity of many of our engagements makes accurately estimating the time and resources required more difficult. We may be liable for civil or criminal penalties under a variety of complex laws and regulations, and changes in governmental regulations could adversely affect our business and financial position. Our businesses must comply with and are affected by various government regulations that impact our operating costs, profit margins and our internal organization and operation of our businesses. These regulations affect how we do business and, in some instances, impose added costs. Any changes in applicable laws could adversely affect our financial performance. Any material failure to comply with applicable laws could result in contract termination, price or fee reductions or suspension or debarment from contracting. The more significant regulations include: · the Federal Acquisition Regulations and all department and agency supplements, which comprehensively regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts; · the Truth in Negotiations Act and implementing regulations, which require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; · laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data; · regulations of most state and regional agencies and foreign governments similar to those described above; · the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and · tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Business disruptions could seriously affect us. Our business may be affected by disruptions including, but not limited to: threats to physical security of our facilities and employees, including senior executives; terrorist acts; information technology attacks or failures; damaging weather or other acts of nature; and pandemics or other public health crises. The costs related to these events may not be fully mitigated by insurance or other means. Disruptions could affect our internal operations or services provided to customers, and could impact our sales, increase our expenses, or adversely affect our reputation or our stock price. 15 Our failure to identify, attract and retain qualified technical and management personnel could adversely affect our existing businesses. We may not be able to attract or retain the highly qualified technical personnel, including engineers, computer programmers, and personnel with security clearances required for classified work, or management personnel to supervise such activities that are necessary for maintaining and growing our existing businesses. We may incur significant costs in protecting our intellectual property which could adversely affect our profit margins. Our inability to protect our patents and proprietary rights could adversely affect our businesses prospects and competitive positions. We seek to protect proprietary technology and inventions through patents and other proprietary-right protection. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these protections, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary rights. In addition, we may incur significant expense both in protecting our intellectual property and in defending or assessing claims with respect to intellectual property owned by others. We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and know-how, including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors. These agreements may be breached and remedies for a breach may not be sufficient to compensate us for damages incurred. We generally control and limit access to our product documentation and other proprietary information. Other parties may independently develop our know-how or otherwise obtain access to our technology. We compete primarily for government contracts against many companies that are larger, better capitalized and better known than us. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business and prospects will be adversely affected. Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets. Many of our competitors are larger, better financed and better known companies who may compete more effectively than we can. In order to remain competitive, we must keep our capabilities technically advanced and compete on price and on value added to our customers. Our ability to compete may be adversely affected by limits on our capital resources and our ability to invest in maintaining and expanding our market share. The terms of our financing arrangements may restrict our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to invest in new business opportunities. We currently have unsecured borrowing arrangements. The terms of these borrowing arrangements include provisions that limit our levels of debt and require minimum levels of net worth and coverage of fixed charges. We also have provided performance guarantee to a customer that contains financial covenants including minimum levels of working capital and tangible net worth. We may incur future obligations that would subject us to additional covenants that affect our financial and operational flexibility or subject us to different events of default. Our current $150 million unsecured revolving credit facility expires in December 2012. At the present time there are no borrowings under our present revolving facility and $61.4 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our revenues could be less than expected if we are not able to deliver services or products as scheduled due to disruptions in supply. Because our internal manufacturing capacity is limited, we use contract manufacturers. While we use care in selecting our manufacturers, we have less control over the reliability of supply, quality and price of products or components than if we manufactured them. In some cases, we obtain products from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Consequently, we risk disruptions in our supply of key products and components if our suppliers fail or are unable to perform because of strikes, natural disasters, financial condition or other factors. Any material supply disruptions could adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations under our contracts and could result in cancellation of contracts or purchase orders, penalties, delays in realizing revenues, payment delays, as well as adversely affect our ongoing product cost structure. 16 Failure to perform by our subcontractors could materially and adversely affect our contract performance and our ability to obtain future business. Our performance of contracts often involves subcontractors, upon which we rely to complete delivery of products or services to our customers. We may have disputes with subcontractors. A failure by a subcontractor to satisfactorily deliver products or services can adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor. Any subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in the customer terminating our contract for default, which could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the customer and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts. We may acquire other companies, which could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive. Part of our strategy involves the acquisition of other companies. We may not be able to integrate acquired entities successfully without substantial expense, delay or operational or financial problems. The acquisition and integration of new businesses involves risk. The integration of acquired businesses may be costly and may adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition: · we may need to divert management resources to integration, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other more profitable activities; · integration may be difficult as a result of the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures; · we may not be able to eliminate redundant costs anticipated at the time we select acquisition candidates; and · one or more of our acquisition candidates may have unexpected liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through our due diligence procedures prior to the acquisition. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose taxes based on income and other criteria. Changes in domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower tax rates assessed, changes in the taxability of certain revenues or activities, or changes in the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our tax expense and profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense. Our results of operations have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our revenues are affected by factors such as the unpredictability of contract awards due to the long procurement process for most of our products and services, the potential fluctuation of governmental agency budgets, the time it takes for the new markets we target to develop and for us to develop and provide products and services for those markets, competition and general economic conditions. Our contract type/product mix and unit volume, our ability to keep expenses within budget, and our pricing affect our operating margins. Significant growth in costs to complete our contracts may adversely affect our results of operations in future periods. These factors and other risk factors described herein may adversely affect our results of operations and cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. Consequently, we do not believe that comparison of our results of operations from period to period is necessarily meaningful or predictive of our likely future results of operations. In some future financial period our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors. If so, the market price of our securities may decline significantly. 17 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This report, including the documents that we incorporate by reference, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections.
