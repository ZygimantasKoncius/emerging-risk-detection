Interest rates are beyond the Companys control, and they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board.

Changes to these laws could affect the Companys ability to deliver or expand its services and diminish the value of its business. The business strategy of the Company includes growth through acquisition. Any future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks include among other things; the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of acquired banks and branches, the potential disruption of our ongoing business, the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position, and the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management.
