Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements in this report. Our MD&A is composed of four major sections: Recent Developments; Results of Operations; Capital Resources and Liquidity; and Application of Critical Accounting Policies. Change in Fiscal Year Effective December 31, 2012, we changed our fiscal year end from July 31 to December 31. This MD&A is intended to cover the audited calendar year that began on January 1, 2013 and ended on December 31, 2013. Comparative financial information to 2013 is provided in this Form 10-K with respect to the calendar year that began on January 1, 2012 and ended on December 31, 2012, which is unaudited. Additional information is provided comparing the five-month periods ended December 31, 2012 (audited) and December 31, 2011 (unaudited), as well as the Company’s former fiscal years ended July 31, 2012 and 2011 (both audited), respectively. 16 Recent Developments On August 22, 2012, the Company entered into a Grant Agreement (the “Grant Agreement”) with the Arizona Commerce Authority, an agency of the State of Arizona (the “Authority”), pursuant to which the Authority will provide certain state and county sponsored incentives for the Company to relocate its corporate headquarters to, and expand its business within, the State of Arizona (the “Project”). Pursuant to the Grant Agreement, the Authority agreed to provide a total grant in the amount of $1,000,000 (the “Grant”) for the use by the Company in the advancement of the Project. The Grant is payable out of an escrow account in four installments, upon the achievement of the following milestones: ·Milestone 1 – Relocation of Company’s operations and corporate headquarters to Arizona and creation of 15 Qualified Jobs (as defined below). ·Milestone 2 – Creation of 30 Qualified Jobs (including Qualified Jobs under Milestone 1). ·Milestone 3 – Creation of 40 Qualified Jobs (including Qualified Jobs under Milestones 1 and 2). ·Milestone 4 – Creation of 65 Qualified Jobs (including Qualified Jobs under Milestones 1, 2 and 3) and capital investment of at least $4,520,000. For purposes of the Grant Agreement, a “Qualified Job” is a job that is permanent, full-time, new to Arizona, and for which the Company pays average (across all Qualified Jobs identified by the Company in its discretion) annual wages of at least $63,000 and offers health insurance benefits and pays at least 65% of the premiums associated with such benefits. The amount of each installment payment will be determined in accordance with a formula specified in the Grant Agreement. The Grant Agreement also contains other customary provisions, including representations, warranties and covenants of both parties. Changes in Results of Operations: Year ended December 31, 2013 (audited) compared to year ended December 31, 2012 (unaudited) During the year ended December 31, 2013, total revenues were $48,285 as compared to $52,215 during the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $3,930 or 8%. The decrease was due to fluctuations in partner sales volumes on which royalties were due the Company. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $10,673,016 as compared to $2,031,593 during the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $8,641,423 or 425%. The increase is primarily the result of increasing employee headcount and increased purchases of laboratory and instrument engineering supplies to support research and development efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2013, sales, general and administrative expenses were $4,312,281 as compared to $3,673,251 during the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $639,030 or 17%. The increase is primarily driven by salaries and related expenses as we ramp up our operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, amortization was $76,903 as compared to $177,396 during the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $100,493 or 57%. This decrease is the result of impairment of patents and intellectual assets in the prior year as discussed below. Depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $285,592 as compared to $6,225 during the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $279,367 or 4488%. The increased depreciation was the result of purchases of equipment to up-fit the new Tucson facility laboratory and administrative space. Impairment of intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $11,352 compared to $2,330,070 for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $2,318,718 or 100%. Management determined certain capitalized intellectual property amounts carried on our balance sheet were no longer recoverable and abandoned its plan to pursue marketability resulting in the impairment charge. 17 As a result of the above factors, loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $15,310,859 as compared to the loss of $8,166,320 during the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase in loss from operations of $7,144,539 or 87%. This loss was anticipated and is the result of planned growth. Other non-operating income during the year ended December 31, 2013 was $29,038 as compared to $42,565 during the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $13,527 or 32%. This change is due to investment activity. As a result of these factors, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $15,281,821 as compared to a net loss of $8,123,755 during the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase in net loss of $7,158,066 or 88%. Unrealized gain on available-for-sale investments for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $21,730 as compared to $0 during the year ended December 31, 2012. The resulting comprehensive losses were $15,260,091 and $8,123,755 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. Changes in Results of Operations: Five Months Ended December 31, 2012 (audited) Compared with Five Months Ended December 31, 2011 (unaudited) OptiChem fees and technical development revenues were $17,712 for the five-month period ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $202,008 for the five-month period ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $184,296 or 91%. The decrease was the result of the final payment under development agreement with Novartis of $140,000, which had concluded prior to and therefore did not recur during the five-month period ended December 31, 2012. During the five-month periods ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, there was no cost of sales due to the fact that no goods were manufactured and sold by the Company during these periods. License revenues recognized during these periods were earned through continuing license arrangements. Research and development expenses for the five-month period ended December 31, 2012 were $1,777,244, as compared to $163,340 for the five-month period ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $1,613,904 or 988%. This increase was primarily the result of instrument engineering hiring and related expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the five-month period ended December 31, 2012 were $1,266,459, as compared to $561,699 for the five-month period ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $704,760 or 125% primarily associated with an increase in salaries and legal fees associated with corporate governance activities. Amortization for the five-month period ended December 31, 2012 was $38,023, as compared to $64,087 for the five-month period ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $26,064 or 41%. The decrease was the result of intangible asset impairments taken in July and October 2012, which thereby decreased the amortization expenses for the five-month period ended December 31, 2012. Depreciation for the five-month period ended December 31, 2012 was $4,644, as compared to $515 for the five-month period ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $4,129 or 802%. The increased depreciation was the result of lab equipment and other infrastructure fixed asset additions during the five-month period ended December 31, 2012. Impairment of intangibles for the five-month period ended December 31, 2012 was $333,487 compared to $0 for the five-month period ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $333,487. Management determined certain capitalized intellectual property amounts carried on our balance sheet were no longer recoverable and abandoned its plan to pursue marketability resulting in the impairment charge. 18 As a result of these factors, loss from operations for the five-month period ended December 31, 2012 was $3,402,145 as compared to a loss of $587,633 for the five-month period ended December 31, 2011, resulting in a greater loss of $2,814,512. Other income for the five-month period ended December 31, 2012 was $1,921 as compared to other income during the five-month period ended December 31, 2011 of $679 an increase in income of $1,242 or 183%. This increase is mainly due to investment activity. As a result of these factors, net loss for the five-month period ended December 31, 2012 was $3,400,224, as compared to a net loss of $586,954 for the five-month period ended December 31, 2011, resulting in a greater loss of $2,813,270. Changes in Results of Operations: Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2012 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2011 Technical development fee revenues were $140,000 for the year ended July 31, 2012, as compared to $842,408 for the year ended July 31, 2011, a decrease of $702,408 or 83%. The decrease in technical development fees was the result of the conclusion of work under the Novartis Technical Development Agreement during the 2012 fiscal year. OptiChem slide revenues for the year ended July 31, 2012 were $45,910, as compared to $34,279 for the year ended July 31, 2011, an increase of $11,631, or 34%. The increase in OptiChem revenues was primarily due to an increase in revenue recognized under our license arrangements with NanoString and SCHOTT. License fees for the year ended July 31, 2012 were $50,000, as compared to $0 during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2011. The increase in license fees was the result of the licensing agreement executed with SCHOTT during the period which consisted of an upfront license fee of $50,000 and $100,000 in prepaid royalties. Pursuant to the Company’s revenue recognition policy and generally accepted accounting policies, the upfront payment was recognized upon receipt and the prepaid royalties recognized in the period in which they are earned based on sales reported by SCHOTT. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2011, we received a Qualified Therapeutic Discovery Grant in the amount of $244,479 that was not presented during the 2012 fiscal year. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no cost of sales due to the fact that the slides are manufactured by SCHOTT and NanoString pursuant to license agreements. Research and development expenses for the year ended July 31, 2012, were $431,906, as compared to $454,997 during the year ended July 31, 2011, a decrease of $23,091 or 5%. This decrease was primarily the result of reductions in clinical trial expenditures. Clinical trial expenditures decreased to $27,342 for the year ended July 31, 2012 from $35,871 for the year ended July 31, 2011, a decrease of $8,529 or 24%. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the year ended July 31, 2012 were $2,953,624, as compared to $819,699 during the year ended July 31, 2011, an increase of $2,133,925 or 260% primarily due to a one-time severance charge to a former director. The decrease in amortization for the year ended July 31, 2012 was negligible. Depreciation for the year ended July 31, 2012 was $2,097 as compared to $2,396 during the year ended July 31, 2011 a decrease of $299 or 12%. The decreased depreciation was primarily due to equipment becoming fully depreciated. As a result of these factors, loss from operations for the year ended July 31, 2012 was $5,351,760, as compared to a loss of $409,425 for the year ended July 31, 2011, resulting in a greater loss of $4,942,335. 19 Interest and dividend income for the year ended July 31, 2012 was $16,297, consistent with $16,092 for the year ended July 31, 2011. During the fiscal years ended July 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company maintained a deferred compensation trust held for the benefit of a director and a former executive officer of the Company. Unrealized gains on marketable securities (which specifically excludes shares of the Company’s Common Stock held in the deferred compensation trust) held in the deferred compensation trust for the year ended July 31, 2012 was $23,987 as compared to an unrealized gain of $14,572 during the year ended July 31, 2011. The increased unrealized gain was a result of market fluctuations on the securities that are held in the deferred compensation trust. As a result of these factors, net loss for the year ended July 31, 2012 was $5,310,476 as compared to a net loss of $378,761 during the year ended July 31, 2011, a greater loss of $4,931,715. Capital Resources and Liquidity During the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, we did not generate positive cash flows from operating activities. Our primary sources of liquidity have been from sales of shares of our Common Stock. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had $41,988,345 in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, an increase of $29,919,598 from $12,068,747 at December 31, 2012. The primary reason for the change in these assets was two equity transactions; first, the exercise of warrants previously issued to Abeja in June 2012, and second, a $20,000,000 rights offering transaction completed in August 2013. The rights offering period expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 7, 2013, and the transactions contemplated by the rights offering and a Standby Purchase Agreement with Abeja (including the Company’s issuance of an aggregate of 2,487,562 shares of its Common Stock to the rights offering participants and standby purchaser) were completed on August 8, 2013. The Company received gross proceeds of $20,000,000 before costs associated with the transactions, which totaled $88,785. The Company has now closed its Denver location and fully relocated to Tucson, Arizona, where it is subject to a Lease Agreement with Pima County of Arizona. The future minimum lease payments under the Lease Agreement are $141,664, $141,664, and $1,164 for years ending 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, management believes that current cash balances will be more than sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for the next fiscal year. The following summarizes the Company’s capital resources at December 31, 2013 compared with December 31, 2012: December 31, 2013 (unaudited) December 31, 2012 (unaudited) Cash and cash equivalents $30,028,961 $12,068,747 Investments 11,959,384 — Trade accounts receivable 24,400 763,899 Current assets 42,142,935 12,849,025 Total assets 43,430,377 13,316,116 Current liabilities 1,136,930 1,248,068 Working Capital 41,006,005 11,600,957 Net cash used in operating activities 9,748,951 2,136,153 Net cash used in investing activities 13,171,180 158,348 Net cash provided by financing activities 40,880,345 100,000 20 Our primary use of capital has been for the continued development and commercialization of the BACcel™ system. We believe our capital requirements will continue to be met with our existing cash balance and those provided under grants, exercises of warrants and stock options and/or, additional issuance of equity or debt securities. Further, if capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned, we may require additional capital sooner than expected. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current common stockholders. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2013. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2013-12, Definition of a Public Business Entity. The purpose of this standard is to clarify which nonpublic entities potentially qualify for alternative financial accounting and reporting guidance by defining “public business entity” for future use in U.S. GAAP. Currently, FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) includes multiple definitions of “public entity”. This standard provides a single definition of “public business entity” for use in future financial accounting and reporting guidance but does not affect existing requirements. There is no effective date for this standard but the definition will start to be used in ASU’s as FASB feels is appropriate. The standard defines “public business entity” as a business entity that meets any one of a number of criteria, one of which is the requirement to file financial statements with the SEC. We have reviewed the definition and have determined that we will be defined as a “public business entity” and there will be no impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, which requires a reporting entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit as a liability in the financial statements separate from deferred tax assets if a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available as of the reporting date to settle taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position or if a reporting entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose. The amendments in ASU 2013-11 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2013. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2013-11 in the first quarter of 2014 to have a material impact on our financial statements. In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-04, which provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date. The update requires an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability obligations for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of the update is fixed at the reporting date, as the sum of the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangements among its co-obligors and any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. The update also requires an entity to disclose the nature and amount of the obligation as well as other information about those obligations. The amendments in ASU 2013-04 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2013 and must be applied retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2013-04 in the first quarter of 2014 to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We consider our accounting policies related to deferred taxes, intangible assets, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, and stock-based compensation to be critical accounting policies. A number of significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments are inherent in our determination of intangible asset amortization expense, how to evaluate our long-lived and intangible assets for impairment, and stock-based compensation expense. These estimates, assumptions and judgments include estimating the period an intangible asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows, estimating the fair value of an intangible asset, and estimating the useful life and volatility of stock awards. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 21 Deferred Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. As of December 31, 2013, December 31, 2012, July 31, 2012 and July 31, 2011, we have established a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax asset, as we have not been able to determine that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to allow us to realize the deferred tax asset (See Item 8, Note 12, Income Taxes, to the footnotes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information). Intangible Assets We amortize our intangible assets over the period the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. We evaluate the remaining useful life of each intangible asset that is being amortized each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We review our intangible assets for impairment each reporting period as discussed below under “Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets.” An impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value (See Item 8, Note 6, Intellectual Property, to the footnotes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information). Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets We assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following: ·Significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; ·Significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; ·Significant negative industry or economic trends; ·Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and ·Our market capitalization relative to net book value. When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are also based on legal factors, market conditions and expected future operational performance of related product lines of the identifiable intangible. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our identifiable assets are impaired. We also evaluate the remaining estimated useful lives of each asset each reporting period and determine whether events or circumstances require revised useful lives. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2012, management determined that acquired technology amounts carried on our balance sheet are no longer recoverable or abandoned its plan to pursue marketability and accordingly reduced the amortized book values by $1,996,583 and recognized the loss in its reported net loss. Additionally, during the five-month period ended December 31, 2012 management determined that patent amounts carried on our balance sheet are no longer recoverable or abandoned its plan to pursue marketability and accordingly reduced the amortized book value by $333,487 and recognized the loss in its reported net loss (See Item 8, Note 6, Intellectual Property, to the footnotes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information). 22 Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718. Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period. In determining the fair value of the stock-based compensation, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include: estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term), the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (expected volatility), risk-free interest rate (interest rate), expected dividends and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation (See Item 8, Note 2, Equity Based Compensation and Item 8, Note 11, Employee Stock Based Compensation to the footnotes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information). Contractual Obligations The Company has certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Company’s 2012 Proxy Statement that is incorporated herein by reference that existed as of July 31, 2012 that do not meet the definition of long term debt obligations, capital leases, operating leases or purchase obligations. Subsequent to July 31, 2012, the Company has entered into a Lease Agreement as described in Item
