RISK FACTORS Before you invest in our securities, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below and in BUSINESS, MD&A, and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and/or prospects. Conservatorship and Related Developments We expect to make additional draws under the Purchase Agreement in future periods, which will adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. It is likely that we will continue to record significant losses in future periods, which will lead us to require additional draws under the Purchase Agreement. Due to the implementation of changes to the accounting standards for transfers of financial assets and consolidation of VIEs, we recorded a significant decrease in our total equity (deficit) on January 1, 2010, which increases the likelihood that we will require a draw from Treasury under the Purchase Agreement for the first quarter of 2010. The cumulative effect of these changes in accounting principles as of January 1, 2010 is a net decrease of approximately $11.7 billion to total equity (deficit), which includes the changes to the opening balances of AOCI and retained earnings (accumulated deficit). In addition, a variety of other factors could lead us to make additional draws under the Purchase Agreement in the future, including:  future losses, driven by ongoing weak economic conditions, which could cause, among other things, increased provision for credit losses and REO operations expense and additional unrealized losses on our non-agency mortgage-related securities;  dividend obligations on the senior preferred stock, which are cumulative and accrue at an annual rate of 10% or 12% in any quarter in which dividends are not paid in cash until all accrued dividends are paid in cash;  pursuit of public mission-oriented objectives that could produce suboptimal financial returns, such as our efforts under the MHA Program, the continued use or expansion of foreclosure suspensions, loan modifications and other foreclosure prevention efforts;  adverse changes in interest rates, the yield curve, implied volatility or mortgage-to-debt OAS, which could increase realized and unrealized mark-to-fair value losses recorded in earnings or AOCI;  limitations in our access to the public debt markets, or increases in our debt funding costs;  establishment of a valuation allowance for our remaining deferred tax asset;  limitations on our ability to develop new products;  changes in business practices and requirements resulting from legislative and regulatory developments; and  the quarterly commitment fee we must pay to Treasury beginning in 2011 under the Purchase Agreement, which has not yet been established and could be substantial. Under the amendment to the Purchase Agreement adopted on December 24, 2009, the $200 billion cap on Treasurys funding commitment will increase as necessary to accommodate any cumulative reduction in our net worth during 2010, 2011 and 2012. Although additional draws under the Purchase Agreement will allow us to remain solvent and avoid mandatory receivership, they will also increase the liquidation preference of, and the dividends we owe on, the senior preferred stock. Based on the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock of $51.7 billion as of December 31, 2009, Treasury is entitled to annual cash dividends of $5.2 billion, which exceeds our annual historical earnings in most periods. Increases in the already substantial liquidation preference and senior preferred dividend obligation, along with limited flexibility to redeem the senior preferred stock, will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and add to the significant uncertainty regarding our long-term financial sustainability. Our business objectives and strategies have in some cases been significantly altered since we were placed into conservatorship, and may continue to change, in ways that negatively affect our future financial condition and results of operations. FHFA, as Conservator, has directed the company to focus on managing to a positive stockholders equity. At the direction of the Conservator, we have made changes to certain business practices that are designed to provide support for the mortgage market in a manner that serves our public mission and other non-financial objectives but may not contribute to our 33 Freddie Mac Table of Contents goal of managing to a positive stockholders equity. Some of these changes have increased our expenses or caused us to forego revenue opportunities. For example, FHFA, has directed that we implement various initiatives under the MHA Program. We expect to incur significant costs associated with the implementation of these initiatives and it is not possible at present to estimate whether, and the extent to which, costs, incurred in the near term, will be offset by the prevention or reduction of potential future costs of loan defaults and foreclosures due to these initiatives. We are also providing significant support to state and local housing finance agencies pursuant to the Housing Finance Agency Initiative. The Conservator and Treasury did not authorize us to engage in certain business activities and transactions, including the sale of certain assets, which we believe may have had a beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition, if executed. Our inability to execute such transactions may adversely affect our profitability. Other agencies of the U.S. government, as well as Congress, also may have an interest in the conduct of our business. We do not know what actions they may request us to take. In view of the conservatorship and the reasons stated by FHFA for its establishment, it is likely that our business model and strategic objectives will continue to change, possibly significantly, including in pursuit of our public mission and other non-financial objectives. Among other things, we could experience significant changes in the size, growth and characteristics of our guarantor and investment activities, and we could further change our operational objectives, including our pricing strategy in our core mortgage guarantee business. Accordingly, our strategic and operational focus going forward may not be consistent with the investment objectives of our investors. It is possible that we will make material changes to our capital strategy and to our accounting policies, methods, and estimates. It is also possible that the company could be restructured and its statutory mission revised. In addition, we may be directed to engage in activities that are operationally difficult or costly to implement. In a letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Congressional Banking and Financial Services Committees dated February 2, 2010, the Acting Director of FHFA stated that minimizing our credit losses is our central goal and that we will be limited to continuing our existing core business activities and taking actions necessary to advance the goals of the conservatorship. The Acting Director stated that FHFA does not expect we will be a substantial buyer or seller of mortgages for our mortgage-related investments portfolio, except for purchases of delinquent mortgages out of PC pools. The Acting Director also stated that permitting us to engage in new products is inconsistent with the goals of the conservatorship. These restrictions could limit our ability to return to profitability in future periods. As our Conservator, FHFA possesses all of the powers of our stockholders, officers and directors. During the conservatorship, the Conservator has delegated certain authority to the Board of Directors to oversee, and management to conduct, day-to-day operations so that the company can continue to operate in the ordinary course of business. FHFA has the ability to withdraw its delegations of authority and override actions of our Board of Directors at any time. In addition, FHFA has the power to take actions without our knowledge, that could be material to investors and could significantly affect our financial performance. FHFA is also Conservator of Fannie Mae, our primary competitor. We do not know the impact on our business of FHFAs serving as Conservator of Fannie Mae. These changes and other factors could have material adverse effects on, among other things, our portfolio growth, net worth, credit losses, net interest income, guarantee fee income, net deferred tax assets, and loan loss reserves, and could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. In light of the significant uncertainty surrounding these changes, there can be no assurances regarding when, or if, we will return to profitability. We are subject to significant limitations on our business activities under the Purchase Agreement which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The Purchase Agreement includes significant restrictions on our ability to manage our business, including limitations on the amount of indebtedness we may incur, the size of our mortgage-related investments portfolio and the circumstances in which we may pay dividends, raise capital and pay down the liquidation preference on the senior preferred stock. In addition, the Purchase Agreement provides that we may not enter into any new compensation arrangements or increase amounts or benefits payable under existing compensation arrangements of any executive officers without the consent of the Director of FHFA, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. In deciding whether or not to consent to any request for approval it receives from us under the Purchase Agreement, Treasury has the right to withhold its consent for any reason and is not required by the agreement to consider any particular factors, including whether or not management believes that the transaction would benefit the company. The limitations under the Purchase Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. On February 18, 2010, we received a letter from the Acting Director of FHFA stating that FHFA has determined that any sale of the LIHTC investments by Freddie Mac would require Treasurys consent under the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The letter further stated that FHFA had presented other options for Treasury to consider, including allowing 34 Freddie Mac Table of Contents Freddie Mac to pay senior preferred stock dividends by waiving the right to claim future tax benefits of the LIHTC investments. However, after further consultation with Treasury and consistent with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Acting Director informed us we may not sell or transfer the assets and that he sees no other disposition options. As a result, we wrote down the carrying value of our LIHTC investments to zero as of December 31, 2009, resulting in a loss of $3.4 billion. This write-down reduces our net worth at December 31, 2009 and, as such, increases the likelihood that we will require additional draws from Treasury under the Purchase Agreement and, as a consequence, increases the likelihood that our dividend obligation on the senior preferred stock will increase. See NOTE 5: VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. The conservatorship is indefinite in duration and the timing, conditions and likelihood of our emerging from conservatorship are uncertain. Even if the conservatorship is terminated, we would remain subject to the Purchase Agreement, senior preferred stock and warrant. FHFA has stated that there is no exact time frame as to when the conservatorship may end. Termination of the conservatorship (other than in connection with receivership) also requires Treasurys consent under the Purchase Agreement. There can be no assurance as to when, and under what circumstances, Treasury would give such consent. There is also significant uncertainty as to what changes may occur to our business structure during or following our conservatorship, including whether we will continue to exist. It is possible that the conservatorship will end with us being placed into receivership. In addition, Treasury has the ability to acquire a majority of our common stock for nominal consideration by exercising the warrant we issued to it pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Consequently, the company could effectively remain under the control of the U.S. government even if the conservatorship was ended and the voting rights of common stockholders restored. The warrant held by Treasury, the restrictions on our business contained in the Purchase Agreement and the senior status of the senior preferred stock issued to Treasury under the Purchase Agreement, if the senior preferred stock has not been redeemed, also could adversely affect our ability to attract new private sector capital in the future should the company be in a position to seek such capital. Moreover, our draws under Treasurys funding commitment and the senior preferred dividend obligation could permanently impair our ability to build independent sources of capital. Our regulator may, and in some cases must, place us into receivership, which would result in the liquidation of our assets and terminate all rights and claims that our stockholders and creditors may have against our assets or under our charter; if we are liquidated, there may not be sufficient funds to pay the secured and unsecured claims of the company, repay the liquidation preference of any series of our preferred stock or make any distribution to the holders of our common stock. Under the Reform Act, FHFA must place us into receivership if FHFA determines in writing that our assets are less than our obligations for a period of 60 days. FHFA has notified us that the measurement period for any mandatory receivership determination with respect to our assets and obligations would commence no earlier than the SEC public filing deadline for our quarterly or annual financial statements and would continue for 60 calendar days after that date. FHFA has also advised us that, if, during that 60-day period, we receive funds from Treasury in an amount at least equal to the deficiency amount under the Purchase Agreement, the Director of FHFA will not make a mandatory receivership determination. In addition, we could be put into receivership at the discretion of the Director of FHFA at any time for other reasons, including conditions that FHFA has already asserted existed at the time the then Director of FHFA placed us into conservatorship. These include: a substantial dissipation of assets or earnings due to unsafe or unsound practices; the existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; an inability to meet our obligations in the ordinary course of business; a weakening of our condition due to unsafe or unsound practices or conditions; critical undercapitalization; the likelihood of losses that will deplete substantially all of our capital; or by consent. A receivership would terminate the conservatorship. The appointment of FHFA (or any other entity) as our receiver would terminate all rights and claims that our stockholders and creditors may have against our assets or under our charter arising as a result of their status as stockholders or creditors, other than the potential ability to be paid upon our liquidation. Unlike a conservatorship, the purpose of which is to conserve our assets and return us to a sound and solvent condition, the purpose of a receivership is to liquidate our assets and resolve claims against us. In the event of a liquidation of our assets, there can be no assurance that there would be sufficient proceeds to pay the secured and unsecured claims of the company, repay the liquidation preference of any series of our preferred stock or make any distribution to the holders of our common stock. To the extent that we are placed in receivership and do not or cannot fulfill our guarantee to the holders of our mortgage-related securities, such holders could become unsecured creditors of ours with respect to claims made under our guarantee. Only after paying the secured and unsecured claims of the company, the administrative expenses of the receiver and the liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock, which ranks prior to our common stock and all other series of preferred stock upon liquidation, would any liquidation proceeds be available to repay the liquidation preference on any other series of preferred stock. Finally, only after the liquidation preference on all series of 35 Freddie Mac Table of Contents preferred stock is repaid would any liquidation proceeds be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock. The aggregate liquidation preference on the senior preferred stock owned by Treasury was $51.7 billion as of December 31, 2009. The liquidation preference will increase further if we make additional draws under the Purchase Agreement, if we do not pay dividends owed on the senior preferred stock in cash or if we do not pay the quarterly commitment fee to Treasury under the Purchase Agreement. We have a variety of different, and potentially competing, objectives that may adversely affect our financial results and our ability to maintain positive net worth. Based on our charter, public statements from Treasury and FHFA officials and guidance from our Conservator, we have a variety of different, and potentially competing, objectives. These objectives include providing liquidity, stability and affordability in the mortgage market; continuing to provide additional assistance to the struggling housing and mortgage markets; reducing the need to draw funds from Treasury pursuant to the Purchase Agreement; returning to long-term profitability; and protecting the interests of the taxpayers. These objectives create conflicts in strategic and day-to-day decision making that will likely lead to suboptimal outcomes for one or more, or possibly all, of these objectives. Current portfolio investment and mortgage guarantee activities, liquidity support, and loan modification and foreclosure forbearance initiatives, including our efforts under the MHA Program and the Housing Finance Agency Initiative, are intended to provide support for the mortgage market in a manner that serves our public mission and other non-financial objectives under conservatorship, but may negatively impact our financial results and net worth. We have experienced significant management changes which could increase our control risks and have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business and our results of operations. Since September 2008, we have had numerous changes in our senior management and governance structure, including FHFA becoming our Conservator, a reconstituted Board of Directors, three changes in our Chief Executive Officer, three changes in our Chief Financial Officer and a new Chief Operating Officer. The magnitude of these changes and the short time interval in which they have occurred, particularly during the ongoing housing and economic crisis, add to the risks of control failures, including a failure in the effective operation of our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures. Control failures could result in material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. A new senior management team was installed between August and October 2009. It may take time for this new team to become sufficiently familiar with our business and each other to effectively develop and implement our business strategies. This turnover of key management positions could further harm our financial performance and results of operations. Management attention may be diverted from regular business concerns by reorganizations and the need to operate under the framework of conservatorship. The conservatorship and uncertainty concerning our future may have an adverse effect on the retention and recruitment of management and other valuable employees. Our ability to recruit, retain and engage management and other valuable employees with the necessary skills to conduct our business may be adversely affected by the conservatorship, the uncertainty regarding its duration and the potential for future legislative or regulatory actions that could significantly affect our status as a GSE and our role in the secondary mortgage market. The actions taken by Treasury and the Conservator to date, or that may be taken by them or other government agencies in the future, may have an adverse effect on the retention and recruitment of senior executives and others in management. For example, we are subject to restrictions on the amount of compensation we may pay our executives under conservatorship. In addition, new statutory and regulatory requirements restricting executive compensation at institutions that have received federal financial assistance, even if not expressly applicable to us, may be interpreted by FHFA or Treasury as limiting the compensation that we are able to provide to our executive officers and other employees. Although we have established compensation programs designed to help retain key employees, we are not currently in a position to offer employees financial incentives that are equity-based and, as a result of this and other factors relating to the conservatorship that may affect our attractiveness as an employer, we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to other potential employers. Uncertainty about the future of the GSEs affects all of our operations and heightens the risks related to retention of management and other valuable employees. A recovering economy is likely to put additional pressures on turnover in 2010, as other attractive opportunities may become available to people we want to retain. Accordingly, we may not be able to retain or replace executives or other employees with key skills and our ability to conduct our business effectively could be adversely affected. 36 Freddie Mac Table of Contents The conservatorship and investment by Treasury has had, and will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our common and preferred stockholders. Prior to our entry into conservatorship, the market price for our common stock declined substantially. After our entry into conservatorship, the market price of our common stock continued to decline (to less than $1 per share for an extended period) and the investments of our common and preferred stockholders have lost substantial value, which they may never recover. There is significant uncertainty as to what changes may occur to our business structure during or following our conservatorship, including whether we will continue to exist. Therefore, it is likely that our shares could further diminish in value, or cease to have any value. The conservatorship and investment by Treasury has had, and will continue to have, other material adverse effects on our common and preferred stockholders, including the following: Dividends have been eliminated. The Conservator has eliminated dividends on Freddie Mac common and preferred stock (other than dividends on the senior preferred stock) during the conservatorship. In addition, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, dividends may not be paid to common or preferred stockholders (other than on the senior preferred stock) without the consent of Treasury, regardless of whether or not we are in conservatorship. Warrant may substantially dilute investment of current stockholders. If Treasury exercises its warrant to purchase shares of our common stock equal to 79.9% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, the ownership interest in the company of our then existing common stockholders will be substantially diluted. It is possible that stockholders, other than Treasury, will not own more than 20.1% of our total common stock for the duration of our existence. No longer managed to maximize stockholder returns. Because we are in conservatorship, we are no longer managed with a strategy to maximize stockholder returns. No voting rights during conservatorship. The rights and powers of our stockholders are suspended during the conservatorship. During the conservatorship, our common stockholders do not have the ability to elect directors or to vote on other matters unless the Conservator delegates this authority to them. Competitive and Market Risks The future growth of our mortgage-related investments portfolio is significantly limited under the Purchase Agreement and by FHFA regulation, which will result in greater reliance on our guarantee activities to generate revenue. Under the Purchase Agreement and FHFA regulation, the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage-related investments portfolio could not exceed $900 billion as of December 31, 2009, and must decline by 10% per year thereafter until it reaches $250 billion. Due to this restriction, the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage-related investments portfolio may not exceed $810 billion as of December 31, 2010. In addition, under the Purchase Agreement, without the prior consent of Treasury, we may not increase our total indebtedness above a specified limit or become liable for any subordinated indebtedness. Treasury has stated it does not expect us to be an active buyer to increase the size of our mortgage-related investments portfolio, but also does not expect that active selling will be necessary to meet the required portfolio reduction targets. In addition, FHFA has stated that, given the size of our current mortgage-related investments portfolio and the potential volume of delinquent mortgages to be purchased out of PC pools, it expects that any net additions to our mortgage-related investments portfolio would be related to that activity. Therefore, our ability to take advantage of opportunities to purchase mortgage assets at attractive prices may be limited. In addition, notwithstanding the expectations expressed by Treasury and FHFA regarding future selling activity, we can provide no assurance that the cap on our mortgage-related investments portfolio will not, over time, force us to sell mortgage assets at unattractive prices, particularly given the potential in coming periods for significant increases in loan modifications and purchases of delinquent loans, both of which result in the purchase of mortgage loans from our PCs for our mortgage-related investments portfolio. These limitations will reduce the earnings capacity of our mortgage-related investments portfolio business and require us to place greater emphasis on our guarantee activities to generate revenue. However, under conservatorship, our ability to generate revenue through guarantee activities may be limited, as we may be required to adopt business practices that provide support for the mortgage market in a manner that serves our public mission and other non-financial objectives, but that may negatively impact our financial results. For example, as a result of the conservatorship and the current economic environment, we currently seek to issue guarantees with fee terms that are intended to cover our expected credit costs on new purchases and that cover a portion of our ongoing operating expenses. Specifically, our ability to increase our fees to offset higher than expected credit costs on guarantees issued before 2009 is limited while we operate at the direction of our Conservator, and we currently expect that our fees will not cover such credit costs. The combination of the restrictions on our business activities under the Purchase Agreement and under FHFA regulation, combined with our potential inability to generate sufficient revenue through our guarantee activities to offset the effects of those restrictions, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 37 Freddie Mac Table of Contents It may be difficult to increase our returns on new single-family guarantee business. Current profitability levels in our new single-family guarantee business are designed to cover expected default costs on the new business and contribute to covering the companys operating expenses. Any contribution to capital is likely to be well below the level we expect would be necessary to attract private equity capital. Despite this, our current market share relative to Fannie Mae is at the low end of historical averages. Efforts we may make to increase the profitability of new single-family guarantee business, such as by tightening credit standards, could cause our market share to further decrease and the volume of our single-family guarantee business to decline. Currently, our ability to increase the income generated by our single-family guarantee business by increasing contractual guarantee and management fee rates is limited due to competitive pressures and other factors. The appointment of FHFA as Conservator and the Conservators subsequent directive that we provide increased support to the mortgage market has affected our guarantee pricing decisions by limiting our ability to adjust our fees for current expectations of credit risk, and will likely continue to do so. Our competitiveness in purchasing single-family mortgages from our lender customers, and thus the relative profitability of new single-family business, can be directly affected by the relative price performance of our PCs and comparable Fannie Mae securities. Increasing demand for our PCs helps support the price performance of our PCs, which in turn helps us compete with Fannie Mae and others in purchasing mortgages. Various factors, including market conditions, affect the relative price performance of our PCs. While we employ a variety of strategies to support the price performance of our PCs, any such strategies may fail. In recent periods, the price performance of our PCs has declined relative to comparable Fannie Mae securities, which has negatively impacted the management and guarantee fees we have been able to charge for new single-family mortgages, many of which we purchase by swapping PCs for the mortgages. Increased competition from Fannie Mae, FHA and other institutions may alter our product mix, lower volumes and reduce revenues on new single-family guarantee business. We are subject to mortgage credit risks, including mortgage credit risk relating to off-balance sheet arrangements; increased credit costs related to these risks could adversely affect our financial condition and/or results of operations. Mortgage credit risk is the risk that a borrower will fail to make timely payments on a mortgage or an issuer will fail to make timely payments on a security we own or guarantee, exposing us to the risk of credit losses and credit-related expenses. We are exposed to mortgage credit risk with respect to: (i) single-family and multifamily loans and guaranteed single-family and multifamily PCs and Structured Securities that we hold on our consolidated balance sheets; and (ii) single-family and multifamily loans through PCs, Structured Securities and other mortgage-related guarantees that are not reflected as assets on our consolidated balance sheets in this Form 10-K. Our off-balance sheet exposure includes long-term standby commitments for mortgage assets held by third parties that require that we purchase loans from lenders when the loans subject to these commitments meet certain delinquency criteria. At December 31, 2009, the unpaid principal balance of PCs and Structured Securities held by third parties was $1.5 trillion. Factors that affect the level of our mortgage credit risk include the credit profile of the borrower, home prices, the features of the mortgage loan, the type of property securing the mortgage, and local and regional economic conditions, including regional changes in unemployment rates. While mortgage interest rates remained low in 2009, many borrowers may not have been able to refinance into lower interest mortgages due to substantial declines in home values, market uncertainty and increases in unemployment. Therefore, there can be no assurance that continued low mortgage interest rates or efforts to modify and refinance mortgages pursuant to the MHA Program will result in a decrease in our overall mortgage credit risk. Effective January 1, 2010, the concept of a QSPE was removed from GAAP and entities previously considered QSPEs must be evaluated for consolidation. As a result, commencing in the first quarter of 2010, we have consolidated our single-family PC trusts and certain of our Structured Transactions on our consolidated balance sheets on a prospective basis, which will significantly reduce the amount of our off-balance sheet arrangements but will not alter our exposure to mortgage credit risk on the loans underlying these securities. See MD&A− OUR PORTFOLIOS, MD&A  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS and NOTE 3: FINANCIAL GUARANTEES AND MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our guarantees and off-balance sheet exposures. Loans with Alt-A and interest-only characteristics individually made up 8% and 7% of our single-family mortgage portfolio as of December 31, 2009, respectively (a single loan may have both Alt-A and interest-only characteristics, and thus would be reflected in both the Alt-A and interest-only figures). These loans collectively accounted for 44% of our credit losses in 2009. Our purchases of these mortgages and issuances of guarantees of them expose us to greater credit risks than do other types of mortgages. Our holdings of these loan groups are concentrated in the West region where home prices have experienced steep declines. The West region accounted for approximately 52% of our credit losses in 2009. We have also experienced increases in delinquency rates for prime mortgages, due to continued low housing prices and increasing 38 Freddie Mac Table of Contents unemployment rates during 2009. See MD&A  CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS  Mortgage Loans  Credit Performance of Certain Higher Risk Single-Family Mortgage Loans on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for information on our classification of loans and mortgage-related securities as Alt-A. For a significant percentage of the mortgages we purchase, we have agreed to permit our seller/servicers to underwrite the loans using alternative automated underwriting systems. These alternative systems may use different standards than our own, including, in some cases, lower standards with respect to borrower credit characteristics. Those differences may increase our credit risk and may result in increases in credit losses. Beginning in 2008, the conforming loan limits were significantly increased for mortgages originated in certain high cost areas (the initial increases applied to loans originated after July 1, 2007). Due to our relative lack of experience with these larger loans, purchases pursuant to the high cost conforming loan limits may also expose us to greater credit risks. We are exposed to increased credit risk related to the subprime, Alt-A and option ARM loans that back our non-agency mortgage-related securities investments. Our investments in non-agency mortgage-related securities have included securities that are backed by subprime, Alt-A and option ARM loans. In the past several years, mortgage loan delinquencies and credit losses in the U.S. mortgage market have substantially increased, particularly in the subprime, Alt-A and option ARM sectors of the residential mortgage market. In addition, home prices declined significantly, after extended periods during which home prices appreciated. If delinquency and loss rates on subprime, Alt-A and option ARM loans continue to increase, or there is a further decline in home prices, we could experience additional GAAP losses due to other-than-temporary impairments on our investments in these non-agency mortgage-related securities. In addition, the fair value of these investments has declined and may decline further due to additional ratings downgrades or market events. Any credit enhancements covering these securities, including subordination, may not prevent us from incurring losses. During 2009, we experienced a rapid depletion of credit enhancements on certain of the securities backed by subprime first lien, option ARM and Alt-A loans due to poor performance in the underlying collateral. See MD&A  CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS  Investments in Securities for information about the credit ratings for these securities and the extent to which these securities have been downgraded. The credit losses we experience in future periods as a result of the housing and economic crisis are likely to be larger, perhaps substantially larger, than our current loan loss reserves. Our loan loss reserves, as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, do not reflect our estimate of the future credit losses inherent in our single-family and multifamily mortgage loans, including those underlying our financial guarantees. Rather, pursuant to GAAP, our reserves only reflect probable losses we believe we have already incurred as of the balance sheet date. Because of the housing and economic crisis, there is significant uncertainty regarding the full extent of future credit losses. The credit losses we experience in future periods will adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth. Further declines in U.S. home prices or other adverse changes in the U.S. housing market could negatively impact our business and increase our losses. Throughout 2009, the U.S. housing market continued to experience adverse trends, including continued price depreciation, and rising delinquency and default rates. These conditions, coupled with high unemployment, led to significant increases in our loan delinquencies and credit losses and higher provisioning for loan losses, all of which have adversely affected our financial condition and results of operations. We expect that national home prices will continue to decrease in 2010, which could result in a continued increase in delinquencies or defaults and a level of credit-related losses higher than our expectations when our guarantees were issued. For more information, see MD&A  RISK MANAGEMENT  Credit Risks. Government programs designed to strengthen the U.S. housing market, such as the MHA Program, may fail to achieve expected results, and new programs could be instituted that cause our credit losses to increase. Our business volumes are closely tied to the rate of growth in total outstanding U.S. residential mortgage debt and the size of the U.S. residential mortgage market. The rate of growth in total residential mortgage debt was (1.3)% in 2009 compared to (0.4)% in 2008. If total outstanding U.S. residential mortgage debt were to continue to decline, there could be fewer mortgage loans available for us to purchase, and we could face more competition to purchase a smaller number of loans. Due to a weakening employment market in the U.S. and other factors, apartment market fundamentals continued to deteriorate in 2009, as reflected by increased property vacancy rates and declining average monthly rent levels. Given the significant weakness currently being experienced in the U.S. economy, it is likely that apartment fundamentals will continue to deteriorate during 2010, which could increase delinquencies and cause us to incur additional credit losses relating to our multifamily activities. 39 Freddie Mac Table of Contents We depend on our institutional counterparties to provide services that are critical to our business, and our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more of our institutional counterparties is unable to meet their obligations to us. We face the risk that one or more of the institutional counterparties that has entered into a business contract or arrangement with us may fail to meet its obligations. We face similar risks with respect to contracts or arrangements we enter into on behalf of our securitization trusts. Our primary exposures to institutional counterparty risk are with:  mortgage seller/servicers;  mortgage insurers;  issuers, guarantors or third-party providers of other credit enhancements (including bond insurers);  counterparties to short-term lending and other investment-related agreements and cash equivalent transactions, including such agreements and transactions we manage for our PC trusts;  derivative counterparties;  hazard and title insurers;  mortgage investors and originators; and  document custodians and funds custodians. In some cases, our business with institutional counterparties is concentrated. A significant failure by a major institutional counterparty could have a material adverse effect on our investments in mortgage loans, investments in securities, our derivative portfolio or our credit guarantee activities. See NOTE 19: CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND OTHER RISKS to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Some of our counterparties also may become subject to serious liquidity problems affecting, either temporarily or permanently, their businesses, which may adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. Challenging market conditions have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect the liquidity and financial condition of a number of our counterparties, including some seller/servicers, mortgage insurers and bond insurers. Some of our largest seller/servicers have experienced ratings downgrades and liquidity constraints, and certain large lenders have failed. A default by a counterparty with significant obligations to us could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations efficiently and at cost-effective rates, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations or our financial condition. Many of our counterparties provide several types of services to us. Accordingly, if one of these counterparties were to become insolvent or otherwise default on its obligations to us, it could harm our business and financial results in a variety of ways. See MD&A  RISK MANAGEMENT  Credit Risks  Institutional Credit Risk for additional information regarding our credit risks to our counterparties and how we seek to manage them, and recent consolidation among some of our institutional counterparties. Our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected if mortgage seller/servicers fail to repurchase loans sold to us in breach of representations and warranties or to perform their obligations to service loans in our single-family and multifamily mortgage portfolios. We require seller/servicers to make certain representations and warranties regarding the loans they sell to us. If loans are sold to us in breach of those representations and warranties, we have the contractual right to require the seller/servicer to repurchase those loans from us. In lieu of repurchase, we may choose to allow a seller/servicer to indemnify us against losses on such mortgages. Sometimes a seller/servicer sells us mortgages with recourse, meaning that the seller/servicer agrees to repurchase any mortgage that is delinquent for more than a specified period (usually 120 days), regardless of whether there has been a breach of representations and warranties. Some of our seller/servicers failed to perform their repurchase obligations due to lack of financial capacity, while many of our larger, higher credit-quality institutions have not fully performed their repurchase obligations in a timely manner. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had outstanding repurchase requests to our seller/servicers with respect to loans with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $4 billion and $3 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2009, nearly 30% of our outstanding repurchase requests were outstanding for more than 90 days. Our credit losses may increase to the extent our seller/servicers do not fully meet their repurchase obligations. Enforcing repurchase obligations with lender customers who have the financial capacity to perform those obligations could also negatively impact our relationships with such customers and ability to retain market share. If a servicer is unable to fulfill its repurchase or other responsibilities, we may be unable to sell the applicable servicing rights to a successor servicer and recover, from the sale proceeds, amounts owed to us by the defaulting servicer. The ongoing weakness in the housing market has negatively affected the market for mortgage servicing rights, which increases the risk that we may be unable to sell such rights or may not receive a sufficient price for them. Increased industry 40 Freddie Mac Table of Contents consolidation, bankruptcies of mortgage bankers or bank failures may also make it more difficult for us to sell such rights, because there may not be sufficient capacity in the market, particularly in the event of multiple failures. Our seller/servicers also have a significant role in servicing loans in our single-family mortgage portfolio, which includes an active role in our loss mitigation efforts. Therefore, a decline in their performance could impact the overall quality of our credit performance, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and have significant impacts on our ability to mitigate credit losses. The risk of such a failure remains high as weak economic conditions continue to affect the liquidity and financial condition of many of our seller/servicers, including some of our largest seller/servicers. The inability to realize the anticipated benefits of our loss mitigation plans, a lower realized rate of seller/servicer repurchases or default rates and severity that exceed our current projections could cause our losses to be significantly higher than those currently estimated. Our seller/servicers also have a significant role in servicing loans in our multifamily mortgage portfolio. We are exposed to the risk that multifamily seller/servicers may come under financial pressure due to the current stressful economic environment and weak real estate markets, which could cause degradation in the quality of servicing they provide. See MD&A  RISK MANAGEMENT  Credit Risks  Institutional Credit Risk  Mortgage Seller/Servicers for additional information on our institutional credit risk related to our mortgage seller/servicers. Our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by the financial distress of our derivative and other counterparties. We use derivatives for several purposes, including to rebalance our funding mix in order to more closely match changes in the interest rate characteristics of our mortgage-related assets and to hedge forecasted issuances of debt. Our exposure to derivative counterparties remains highly concentrated as compared to historical levels. Four of our derivative counterparties each accounted for greater than 10% and collectively accounted for 92% of our net uncollateralized exposure, excluding commitments, at December 31, 2009. For a further discussion of our derivative counterparty exposure see MD&A  RISK MANAGEMENT  Credit Risks  Institutional Credit Risk  Derivative Counterparties and NOTE 19: CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND OTHER RISKS to our consolidated financial statements. Some of our derivative and other counterparties have experienced various degrees of financial distress in the past few years, including liquidity constraints, credit downgrades and bankruptcy. Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the financial distress of these derivative and other counterparties to the extent that they fail to meet their obligations to us. For example, we may incur losses if collateral held by us cannot be liquidated at prices that are sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. In addition, our ability to engage in routine derivatives, funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide disruptions in which it may be difficult for us to find acceptable counterparties for such transactions. We also use derivatives to synthetically create the substantive economic equivalent of various debt funding structures. Thus, if our access to the derivative markets were disrupted, it may become more difficult or expensive to fund our business activities and achieve the funding mix we desire, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The use of these derivatives may also expose us to additional counterparty credit risk. Our credit and other losses could increase if our mortgage or bond insurers become insolvent or fail to perform their obligations to us. We are exposed to risk relating to the potential insolvency or non-performance of mortgage insurers that insure single-family mortgages we purchase or guarantee and bond insurers that insure bonds we hold as investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets. Most of our mortgage insurer and bond insurer counterparties experienced ratings downgrades during 2009, and several of them announced comprehensive restructuring plans. The weakened financial condition and liquidity position of these counterparties increases the risk that these entities will fail to reimburse us for claims under insurance policies. As a guarantor, we remain responsible for the payment of principal and interest if a mortgage insurer fails to meet its obligations to reimburse us for claims. Thus, if any of our mortgage insurers fails to fulfill its obligation, we could experience increased credit-related costs. We believe that several of our mortgage insurance counterparties are at risk of falling out of compliance with regulatory capital requirements, which may result in regulatory actions that could restrict the mortgage insurers ability, in certain states, to write new business, and thus could negatively impact our access to mortgage insurance for high LTV loans. In addition, if a regulator determined that a mortgage insurer lacked sufficient capital to pay 41 Freddie Mac Table of Contents all claims when due, the regulator could take action that might impact the timing and amount of claim payments made to us. Further, we independently assess the financial condition, including the claims-paying resources, of each mortgage insurer. Based on our analysis of the financial condition of a mortgage insurer and pursuant to our eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers, we could take action against a mortgage insurer intended to protect our interests that may impact the timing and amount of claims payments received from that insurer. Mortgage insurer rescissions of mortgage insurance coverage are also on the rise. In the event one or more of our bond insurers were to become insolvent, it is likely that we would not collect all of our claims from the affected insurer, and it would impact our ability to recover certain unrealized losses on our investments in non-agency mortgage-related securities. We believe that some of our bond insurers lack sufficient ability to fully meet all of their expected lifetime claims-paying obligations to us as they emerge. In 2009, regulators deemed the financial condition of certain bond insurers to be impaired and ordered such insurers to restructure to relieve the impairment. We are concerned that other bond insurers may be subject to a similar assessment in 2010, and some or all may be unable to restructure to relieve the impairment and may be deemed to be insolvent. If mortgage insurers continue to tighten their standards, the volume of high LTV mortgages available for us to purchase could be reduced, which could negatively affect our business and make it more difficult for us to meet our affordable housing goals. Our charter requires that single-family mortgages with LTV ratios above 80% at the time of purchase be covered by specified credit enhancements or participation interests. In the current environment, many mortgage insurers are restricting the issuance of insurance on new mortgages with higher LTV ratios or with lower borrower credit scores or on select property types, which has contributed to the reduction in our business volumes for loans with LTV ratios over 80%. If our mortgage insurer counterparties further restrict their eligibility requirements or new business volumes for high LTV ratio loans, or if we are no longer willing or able to obtain mortgage insurance from these counterparties, and we are not able to avail ourselves of suitable alternative methods of obtaining credit enhancement for these loans, we may be further restricted in our ability to purchase or securitize loans with LTV ratios over 80% at the time of purchase. For example, where mortgage insurance or another charter-acceptable credit enhancement is not available, we may be hindered in our ability to purchase high LTV ratio loans that refinance mortgages we do not own or guarantee into more affordable loans. The unavailability of suitable credit enhancement could also negatively impact our ability to pursue new business opportunities relating to high LTV ratio and other higher risk loans and therefore harm our competitive position and our earnings. This could also impact our ability to meet our affordable housing goals, as purchases of loans with high LTV ratios can contribute to our performance under those goals. The loss of business volume from key lenders could result in a decline in our market share and revenues. Our business depends on our ability to acquire a steady flow of mortgage loans. We purchase a significant percentage of our single-family mortgages from several large mortgage originators. During 2009 and 2008, approximately 74% and 84%, respectively, of our guaranteed mortgage securities issuances originated from purchase volume associated with our ten largest customers. Two of our single-family customers each accounted for greater than 10% of our mortgage securitization volume for 2009. Similarly, we acquire a significant portion of our multifamily mortgage loans from several large lenders. We enter into mortgage purchase volume commitments with many of our single-family customers that provide for the customers to deliver to us a specified dollar amount or minimum percentage of their total sales of conforming loans. There is a risk that we will not be able to enter into a new commitment with a key customer that will maintain mortgage purchase volume following the expiration of the existing commitment. The mortgage industry has been consolidating and a decreasing number of large lenders originate most single-family mortgages. The loss of business from any one of our major lenders could adversely affect our market share, our revenues and the credit loss performance of our single-family mortgage portfolio. Changes in general business and economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business and results of operations may continue to be adversely affected by changes in general business and economic conditions, including changes in the international markets for our investments or our mortgage-related and debt securities. These conditions include employment rates, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, the strength of the U.S. financial markets and national economy and the local economies in which we conduct business, and the economies of other countries that purchase our mortgage-related and debt securities. In addition, if weak general market conditions continue to negatively impact national and regional economic conditions, we could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses which will likely increase our losses in future periods and will adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The mortgage credit markets experienced very difficult conditions and volatility during 2008 and 2009. The deteriorating conditions in these markets resulted in a decrease in availability of corporate credit and liquidity within the 42 Freddie Mac Table of Contents mortgage industry, causing disruptions to normal operations of major mortgage originators, including some of our largest customers, and have resulted in the insolvency, closure or acquisition of a number of major financial institutions. These conditions also resulted in greater volatility, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency and are expected to contribute to further consolidation within the financial services industry. We operate in these markets and continue to be subject to adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations due to our activities involving securities, mortgages, derivatives and other mortgage commitments with our customers. Competition from banking and non-banking companies may harm our business. Competition in the secondary mortgage market combined with a decreased rate of growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding may make it more difficult for us to purchase mortgages. Furthermore, competitive pricing pressures may make our products less attractive in the market and negatively impact our financial results. Increased competition from Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae may alter our product mix, lower volumes and reduce revenues on new business. Ginnie Mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on mortgage-related securities backed by federally insured or guaranteed loans, primarily those insured by FHA or guaranteed by VA. Historically, we also competed with other financial institutions that retain or securitize mortgages, such as commercial and investment banks, dealers, thrift institutions, and insurance companies. While many of these institutions have ceased or substantially reduced their activities in the secondary market since 2008, it is possible that these institutions will reenter the secondary market. Our business may be adversely affected by limited availability of financing, increased funding costs and uncertainty in our securitization financing. The amount, type and cost of our funding, including financing from other financial institutions and the capital markets, directly impacts our interest expense and results of operations. A number of factors could make such financing more difficult to obtain, more expensive or unavailable on any terms, both domestically and internationally (where funding transactions may be on terms more or less favorable than in the U.S.), including:  termination of, or future restrictions or other adverse changes with respect to, government support programs that may benefit us;  reduced demand for our debt securities; and  competition for debt funding from other debt issuers. Our ability to obtain funding in the public debt markets or by pledging mortgage-related securities as collateral to other financial institutions could cease or change rapidly and the cost of the available funding could increase significantly due to changes in market confidence and other factors. For example, in the fall of 2008, we experienced significant deterioration in our access to the unsecured medium- and long-term debt markets, and were forced to rely on short-term debt to fund our purchases of mortgage assets and refinance maturing debt and to rely on derivatives to synthetically create the substantive economic equivalent of various debt funding structures. Since 2008, the ratings on our non-agency mortgage-related securities backed by Alt-A, subprime and option ARM loans have decreased, limiting their availability as a significant source of liquidity for us through sales or use as collateral in secured lending transactions. In addition, adverse market conditions have negatively impacted our ability to enter into secured lending transactions using agency mortgage-related securities as collateral. These trends are likely to continue in the future. Government Support Changes or perceived changes in the governments support of us could have a severe negative effect on our access to the debt markets and our debt funding costs. Under the amendment to the Purchase Agreement adopted on December 24, 2009, the $200 billion cap on Treasurys funding commitment will increase as necessary to accommodate any cumulative reduction in our net worth during 2010, 2011 and 2012. While we believe that this increased support provided by Treasury will be sufficient to enable us to maintain our access to the debt markets and ensure that we have adequate liquidity to conduct our normal business activities over the next three years, the costs of our debt funding could vary. For example, our funding costs for debt with maturities beyond 2012 could be high. In addition, uncertainty about the future of the GSEs could affect our debt funding costs. The cost of our debt funding could increase if debt investors believe that the risk that we could be placed into receivership is increasing. The completion of the Federal Reserves debt purchase program could negatively affect the availability of longer-term debt funding as well as the spreads on our debt, and thus increase our debt funding costs. Due to the expiration of the Lending Agreement, we no longer have a liquidity backstop available to us (other than draws from Treasury under the Purchase Agreement and Treasurys ability to purchase up to $2.25 billion of our obligations under its permanent statutory authority) if we are unable to obtain funding from issuances of debt or other conventional sources. At present, we are not able to predict the likelihood that a liquidity backstop will be needed, or to identify the alternative sources of liquidity that might be available to us if needed, other than from Treasury as referenced above. 43 Freddie Mac Table of Contents Demand for Debt Funding The willingness of domestic and foreign investors to purchase and hold our debt securities can be influenced by many factors, including changes in the world economy, changes in foreign-currency exchange rates, regulatory and political factors, as well as the availability of and preferences for other investments. If investors were to divest their holdings or reduce their purchases of our debt securities, our funding costs could increase. The willingness of investors to purchase or hold our debt securities, and any changes to such willingness, may materially affect our liquidity, our business and results of operations. Competition for Debt Funding We compete for low-cost debt funding with Fannie Mae, the FHLBs and other institutions. Competition for debt funding from these entities can vary with changes in economic, financial market and regulatory environments. Increased competition for low-cost debt funding may result in a higher cost to finance our business, which could negatively affect our financial results. An inability to issue debt securities at attractive rates in amounts sufficient to fund our business activities and meet our obligations could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. See MD&A  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Liquidity  Debt Securities for a more detailed description of our debt issuance programs. Our funding costs may also be affected by changes in the amount of, and demand for, debt issued by Treasury. Line of Credit We maintain a secured intraday line of credit to provide additional intraday liquidity to fund our activities through the Fedwire system. This line of credit requires us to post collateral to a third party. In certain circumstances, this secured counterparty may be able to repledge the collateral underlying our financing without our consent. In addition, because the secured intraday line of credit is uncommitted, we may not be able to continue to draw on it if and when needed. PCs and Structured Securities Our PCs and Structured Securities are an integral part of our mortgage purchase program. Any decline in the price performance of or demand for our PCs could have an adverse effect on our securitization activities, because we purchase many mortgages by swapping PCs for them. There is a risk that our PC and Structured Securities support activities may not be sufficient to support the liquidity and depth of the market for PCs. Our business may be adversely affected by the completion of the Federal Reserve program to purchase GSE mortgage-related securities. In November 2008, the Federal Reserve implemented a program to purchase GSE mortgage-related securities. The Federal Reserve has announced that it would gradually slow the pace of purchases under the program in order to promote a smooth transition in markets and anticipates that purchases under such program will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. It is difficult at this time to predict the impact that the completion of the Federal Reserves mortgage-related securities purchase program will have on our business and the U.S. mortgage market. It is possible that interest-rate spreads on mortgage-related securities could widen, which could result in additional unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities. This, in turn, could negatively affect our net worth, and thus contribute to the need to make additional draws under the Purchase Agreement. The completion of this program could also result in less demand for our PCs in the market, and negatively affect the relative price performance of our PCs versus comparable Fannie Mae securities. We purchase many of our new single-family mortgages by swapping PCs for the mortgages. Therefore, a decline in our relative price performance could adversely affect our competitiveness in purchasing new single-family mortgages from our lender customers, and thus negatively impact the relative profitability of new single-family business. A reduction in the credit ratings for our debt could adversely affect our liquidity. Nationally recognized statistical rating organizations play an important role in determining, by means of the ratings they assign to issuers and their debt, the availability and cost of debt funding. We currently receive ratings from three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations for our unsecured borrowings. Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. Actions by governmental entities or others, additional GAAP losses, additional draws under the Purchase Agreement and other factors could adversely affect the credit ratings on our debt. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position, or the supply or cost of debt financing available to us. A significant increase in our borrowing costs could cause us to sustain additional GAAP losses or impair our liquidity by requiring us to seek other sources of financing, which may be difficult to obtain. Mortgage fraud could result in significant financial losses and harm to our reputation. We rely on representations and warranties by seller/servicers about the characteristics of the single-family mortgage loans we purchase and securitize, and we do not independently verify most of the information that is provided to us. This exposes us to the risk that one or more of the parties involved in a transaction (such as the borrower, seller, broker, appraiser, 44 Freddie Mac Table of Contents title agent, loan officer, lender or servicer) will engage in fraud by misrepresenting facts about a mortgage loan or a borrower. We may experience significant financial losses and reputational damage as a result of such mortgage fraud. The value of mortgage-related securities guaranteed by us and held as investments in securities may decline if we did not or were unable to perform under our guarantee or if investor confidence in our ability to perform under our guarantee were to diminish. We classify our investments in mortgage-related securities as either available-for-sale or trading, and account for them at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. A portion of our investments in mortgage-related securities are securities guaranteed by us. Our valuation of these securities is consistent with GAAP and the legal structure of the guarantee transaction, which includes the Freddie Mac guarantee to the securitization trusts and on the assets transferred to the securitization trusts (i.e., Freddie Mac guaranteed PCs and Structured Securities). The valuation of our guaranteed mortgage securities necessarily reflects investor confidence in our ability to perform under our guarantee and the liquidity that our guarantee provides. If we did not or were unable to perform under our guarantee, or if investor confidence in our ability to perform under our guarantee were to diminish, the value of our guaranteed securities may decline, thereby reducing the value of the securities reported on our consolidated balance sheets and our ability to sell or otherwise use these securities for liquidity purposes, and adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations, stockholders equity (deficit) and fair value of net assets. Our investment activities and credit guarantee activities expose us to interest rate and other market risks. Changes in interest rates, up or down, could adversely affect our net interest yield. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, either can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest yield to expand or compress. For example, due to the timing of maturities or rate reset dates on variable-rate instruments, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets. This rate change could cause our net interest yield to compress until the effect of the increase is fully reflected in asset yields. Changes in the slope of the yield curve could also reduce our net interest yield. Changes in interest rates could increase our GAAP net loss or deficit in total equity (deficit) materially. Changes in interest rates may also affect prepayment assumptions, thus potentially impacting the fair value of our assets, including our investments in mortgage-related securities and unsecuritized mortgage loans. When interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. An increased likelihood of prepayment on the mortgages underlying our mortgage-related securities may adversely impact the performance of these securities. An increased likelihood of prepayment on the mortgage loans we hold may also negatively impact the performance of our investments in such loans. Interest rates can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including changes in the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies, such as the Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve policies directly and indirectly influence the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. The availability of derivative financial instruments (such as options and interest rate and foreign currency swaps) from acceptable counterparties of the types and in the quantities needed could also affect our ability to effectively manage the risks related to our investment funding. Our strategies and efforts to manage our exposures to these risks may not be as effective as they have been in the past. See QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for a description of the types of market risks to which we are exposed and how we seek to manage those risks. Changes in OAS as a result of the completion of the Federal Reserves mortgage-related securities purchase program or other events could materially impact our fair value of net assets and affect future results of operations, stockholders equity (deficit) and fair value of net assets. OAS is an estimate of the yield spread between a given security and an agency debt yield curve. The OAS between the mortgage and agency debt sectors can significantly affect the fair value of our net assets. The fair value impact of changes in OAS for a given period represents an estimate of the net unrealized increase or decrease in the fair value of net assets arising from net fluctuations in OAS during that period. We do not attempt to hedge or actively manage the impact of changes in mortgage-to-debt OAS. Changes in market conditions, including changes in interest rates, may cause fluctuations in OAS. A widening of the OAS on a given asset, which typically causes a decline in the current fair value of that asset, may cause significant mark-to-fair value losses, and may adversely affect our financial results and stockholders equity (deficit), but may increase the number of attractive investment opportunities in mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities. Conversely, a narrowing or tightening of the OAS typically causes an increase in the current fair value of that asset, but may reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities in mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities. Consequently, a tightening of the OAS 45 Freddie Mac Table of Contents may adversely affect our future financial results and stockholders equity (deficit). See MD&A  CONSOLIDATED FAIR VALUE BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS  Discussion of Fair Value Results for a more detailed description of the impacts of changes in mortgage-to-debt OAS. The Federal Reserves program to purchase GSE mortgage-related securities is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. This could reduce demand for mortgage assets, and could cause mortgage-to-debt OAS to widen. If this occurs, we could experience additional unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities. While wider spreads might create favorable investment opportunities, we may be limited in our ability to take advantage of any such opportunities in future periods because, under the Purchase Agreement and FHFA regulation, the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage-related investments portfolio must decline by 10% per year beginning in 2010 until it reaches $250 billion. FHFA has stated its expectation in the Acting Directors February 2, 2010 letter that any net additions to our mortgage-related investments portfolio would be related to purchasing delinquent mortgages out of PC pools. We could experience significant reputational harm, which could affect the future of our company, if our efforts under the MHA Program, the Housing Finance Agency Initiative and other initiatives to support the U.S. residential mortgage market do not succeed. We are focused on the MHA Program, the Housing Finance Agency Initiative and other initiatives to support the U.S. residential mortgage market. If these initiatives do not achieve their desired results, or are otherwise perceived to have failed to achieve their objectives, we may experience damage to our reputation, which may impact the extent of future government support for our business and government decisions with respect to the future status and role of Freddie Mac. Negative publicity causing damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business prospects, financial results or net worth. Reputation risk, or the risk to our financial results and net worth from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers or otherwise impair our customer relationships, adversely affect our ability to obtain financing, impede our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, hinder our business prospects or adversely impact the trading price of our securities. Perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors or the financial services and mortgage industries as a whole, particularly as they relate to the current economic downturn, may also adversely impact our reputation. Adverse reputation impacts on third parties with whom we have important relationships may impair market confidence or investor confidence in our business operations as well. In addition, negative publicity could expose us to adverse legal and regulatory consequences, including greater regulatory scrutiny or adverse regulatory or legislative changes, and could affect what changes may occur to our business structure during or following conservatorship, including whether we will continue to exist. These adverse consequences could result from perceptions concerning our activities and role in addressing the mortgage market crisis or our actual or alleged action or failure to act in any number of activities, including corporate governance, regulatory compliance, financial reporting and disclosure, purchases of products perceived to be predatory, safeguarding or using nonpublic personal information, or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to our actual or alleged conduct. Business and Operational Risks The MHA Program and other efforts to reduce foreclosures, modify loan terms and refinance mortgages may fail to mitigate our credit losses and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The MHA Program and other loss mitigation activities are a key component of our strategy for managing and resolving troubled assets and lowering credit losses. However, there can be no assurance that any of our loss mitigation strategies will be successful and that credit losses will not escalate. To the extent that borrowers participate in this program in large numbers, it is likely that the costs we incur related to loan modifications and other activities under HAMP may be substantial because we will bear the full cost of the monthly payment reductions related to modifications of loans we own or guarantee, and all servicer and borrower incentive fees. We will not receive a reimbursement of these costs from Treasury. It is possible that Treasury could make changes to HAMP that could make the program more costly to us, both in terms of credit expenses and the cost of implementing and operating the program. For example, we could be required to use principal reduction to achieve reduced payments for borrowers. This would further increase our losses, as we would bear the full costs of such reductions. A significant number of loans are in the trial period of HAMP. Although the ultimate completion rate remains uncertain, it is possible that a large number of loans will fail to complete the trial period or qualify for any of our other loan modification and loss mitigation programs. For these loans, HAMP will have effectively delayed the foreclosure process and could increase our losses, to the extent the prices we ultimately receive for the foreclosed properties are less than the prices we could have received had we foreclosed upon the properties earlier, due to continued home price declines. These delays in foreclosure could also cause our REO operations expense to increase, perhaps substantially. 46 Freddie Mac Table of Contents Our seller/servicers have a key role in the success of our loss mitigation activities. The continued increases in delinquent loan volume and the ongoing weak conditions of the mortgage market during 2009 placed a strain on the loss mitigation resources of many of our seller/servicers. A decline in the performance of seller/servicers in mitigation efforts could result in missed opportunities for successful loan modifications, an increase in our credit losses and damage to our reputation. Depending on the type of loss mitigation activities we pursue, those activities could result in accelerating or slowing prepayments on our PCs or Structured Securities, either of which could negatively affect the pricing of such PCs or Structured Securities. We are devoting significant internal resources to the implementation of the various initiatives under the MHA Program, which will increase our expenses. The size and scope of our effort under the MHA Program may also limit our ability to pursue other important corporate opportunities or initiatives. Our relationships with our customers could be harmed by our actions as the compliance agent under HAMP, which could negatively affect our ability to purchase loans from them in the future. We are the compliance agent for certain foreclosure avoidance activities under HAMP. In this role, we conduct examinations and review servicer compliance with the published requirements for the program. It is unclear how servicers will perceive our actions as compliance agent. It is possible that this could impair our relationships with our lender customers, which could negatively affect our ability to purchase loans from them in the future. We may experience further write-downs and losses relating to our assets, including our investment securities, net deferred tax assets, REO properties or mortgage loans, that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth. We experienced a significant increase in losses and write-downs relating to our assets during 2008 and 2009, including significant declines in market value, impairments of our investment securities, market-based write-downs of REO properties, losses on non-performing loans purchased out of PC pools, and impairments on other assets. A substantial portion of our impairment losses and write-downs relate to our investments in non-agency mortgage-related securities backed by subprime, Alt-A and option ARM mortgage loans. We also incurred significant losses during 2008 and 2009 relating to our investments in non-mortgage-related securities, primarily as a result of a substantial decline in the market value of these assets due to the deteriorating economy and ongoing weakness in the financial markets. The fair value of our investments in securities, including CMBS, may be further adversely affected by continued weakness in the economy, further deterioration in the housing and financial markets, additional ratings downgrades or other events. We increased our valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, net by $2.7 billion during 2009. The future status and role of Freddie Mac could be affected by actions of the Conservator, and legislative and regulatory action that alters the ownership, structure and mission of the company. The uncertainty of these developments could materially affect our operations, which could in turn affect our ability or intent to hold investments until the recovery of any temporary unrealized losses. If future events significantly alter our current outlook, a valuation allowance may need to be established for the remaining deferred tax asset. Due to the ongoing weaknesses in the economy and in the housing and financial markets, we may experience additional write-downs and losses relating to our assets, including those that are currently AAA-rated, and the fair values of our assets may continue to decline. This could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth. In addition, many of these assets do not trade in a liquid secondary market and the size of our holdings relative to normal market activity is such that, if we were to attempt to sell a significant quantity of assets, the pricing in such markets could be significantly disrupted and the price we ultimately realize may be materially lower than the value at which we carry these assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The price and trading liquidity of our common stock and our NYSE-listed issues of preferred stock may be adversely affected if those securities are delisted from the NYSE. If we do not satisfy the minimum share price, corporate governance and other requirements of the continued listing standards of the NYSE, our common stock and NYSE-listed issues of preferred stock could be delisted from the NYSE. In November 2008, the NYSE notified us that we had failed to satisfy one of the NYSEs standards for continued listing of our common stock. Specifically, the NYSE advised us that we were below criteria for the NYSEs price criteria for common stock because the average closing price of our common stock over a consecutive 30 trading-day period was less than $1 per share. In September 2009, the NYSE notified us that we had returned to compliance with the NYSEs minimum share price listing requirement. If our common stock price again fails to meet the NYSEs minimum price criteria, our common stock could be delisted from the NYSE, and this would also likely result in the delisting of our NYSE-listed preferred stock. The delisting of our 47 Freddie Mac Table of Contents common stock or NYSE-listed preferred stock would require any trading in these securities to occur in the over-the-counter market and could adversely affect the market prices and liquidity of these securities. The closing price of our common stock on February 19, 2010 was $1.23 per share. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls could result in errors and inadequate disclosures, affect operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported results. We face continuing challenges because of deficiencies in our controls and the operational and financial accounting complexities of our business. Control deficiencies could result in errors, affect operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported results. For information about the material weaknesses that we remediated during the quarter and our remaining material weakness, see CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Changes to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the Quarter Ended December 31, 2009. There are a number of factors that may impede our efforts to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, including: the nature of the conservatorship and our relationship with FHFA; the complexity of, and significant changes in, our business activities and related GAAP requirements; significant turnover in our senior management in 2009; uncertainty regarding the sustainability of newly established controls; and the uncertain impacts of the ongoing housing and credit market volatility on the reliability of our models used to develop our accounting estimates. We cannot be certain that our efforts to improve and maintain our internal control over financial reporting will ultimately be successful. Effectively designed and operated internal control over financial reporting provides only reasonable assurance that material errors in our financial statements will be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting increases the risk of a material error in our reported financial results and delay in our financial reporting timeline. Depending on the nature of a control failure and any required remediation, ineffective controls could have a material adverse effect on our business. Delays in meeting our financial reporting obligations could affect our ability to maintain the listing of our securities on the NYSE. Ineffective controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities. Recent market conditions have added to the uncertainty about the results of the internal models that we use for financial accounting and reporting purposes, to make business decisions and to manage risks, and our business could be adversely affected if those models fail to produce reliable results. The severe deterioration of the housing and credit markets has created additional risk associated with our model results. Our models may not perform as well in situations for which there are few or no recent historical precedents. The increased risk that models will not produce reliable results creates additional risk regarding the reliability of our financial statements and our ability to manage risks. We have adjusted our models in response to recent events, but the added uncertainty about model results remains. We make significant use of business and financial models for financial accounting and reporting purposes and to manage risk. For example, we use models in determining the fair value of financial instruments for which independent price quotes are not available or reliable, or in extrapolating third-party values to certain of our assets and liabilities. We also use models to measure and monitor our exposure to interest rate and other market risks and credit risk. The information provided by these models is also used in making business decisions relating to strategies, initiatives, transactions and products. Models are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on assumptions and/or historical experience. Our models could produce less reliable results for a number of reasons, including the use of faulty assumptions, the need for frequent adjustments to respond to rapid changes in economic conditions, the application of models to events or products outside the models intended use, and errors, such as incorrect coding or the use of incorrect data. The complexity of our models creates additional risk regarding the reliability of model output. We use market-based information as inputs to our models. However, there is generally a lag between the availability of this market information and the preparation of our financial statements. When market conditions change quickly and in unforeseen ways, there is an increased risk that the inputs reflected in our models are not representative of current market conditions. Management may need to exercise judgment to interpret or adjust modeled results to take into account new information or changes in conditions. The dramatic changes in the housing and credit capital markets have required frequent adjustments to our models and the application of greater management judgment in the interpretation and adjustment of the results produced by our models. We may also need to adjust our models and apply greater management judgment to account for the impact of actions we may take to assist the mortgage market, such as the MHA Program. This further increases the risk that the process may produce less reliable information, particularly since many of these events and actions are unprecedented. 48 Freddie Mac Table of Contents The valuations, risk metrics, amortization results, loan loss reserve estimations and security impairment charges produced by our internal models may be different from actual results, which could adversely affect our business results, cash flows, fair value of net assets, business prospects and future financial results. Changes in any of our models or in any of the assumptions, judgments or estimates used in the models may cause the results generated by the model to be materially different. The different results could cause a revision of previously reported financial condition or results of operations, depending on when the change to the model, assumption, judgment or estimate is implemented. Any such changes may also cause difficulties in comparisons of the financial condition or results of operations of prior or future periods. Due to increased uncertainty about model results, we also face increased risk that we could make poor business decisions in areas where model results are an important factor, including loan purchases, management and guarantee fee pricing and asset and liability management. Furthermore, any strategies we employ to attempt to manage the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective. See MD&A  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  Valuation of a Significant Portion of Assets and Liabilities and QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Interest-Rate Risk and Other Market Risks for more information on our use of models. Changes in our accounting policies, as well as estimates we make, could materially affect how we report our financial condition or results of operations. Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our accounting policies and estimates are critical as they are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and for which materially different amounts could be recorded using different assumptions or estimates. For a description of our critical accounting policies, see MD&A  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. From time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may result in the revision of prior period financial statements by material amounts. The implementation of new or revised accounting standards could result in material adverse effects to our stockholders equity (deficit) and result in or contribute to the need for additional draws under the Purchase Agreement. See NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES to our consolidated financial statements for more information. We face additional risks related to our adoption of changes in accounting standards related to securitization entities. Historically, our PCs, Structured Securities and other securitization entities were generally considered off-balance sheet arrangements. However, effective January 1, 2010, because of changes to the accounting standards for transfers of financial assets and consolidation of VIEs, we consolidated our single-family PC trusts and certain of our Structured Transactions on our consolidated balance sheets. The cumulative effect of these changes in accounting principles as of January 1, 2010 is a net decrease of approximately $11.7 billion to total equity (deficit), which includes the changes to the opening balances of AOCI and retained earnings (accumulated deficit). This will increase the likelihood that we will require a draw from Treasury under the Purchase Agreement for the first quarter of 2010. Implementation of these accounting changes has required us to make significant process and systems changes. Given the magnitude of these changes, the risk that new control weaknesses may be identified has increased. We have devoted significant resources and management attention to complete these changes. This has had, and may continue to have, an adverse affect on our ability to devote resources to other systems, controls and business related initiatives. For example, we may be required to delay the implementation of, or divert resources from, other initiatives, including efforts to remedy previously identified control weaknesses. For additional information, see MD&A  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY and NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Not Yet Adopted Within These Consolidated Financial Statements  Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation of VIEs to our consolidated financial statements. A failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our business, damage our reputation and cause losses. Shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems could lead to impairment of our liquidity, financial loss, disruption of our business, liability to customers, further legislative or regulatory intervention or reputational damage. For example, our business is highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions on a daily basis. The transactions we process are complex and are subject to various legal, accounting and regulatory standards. Our financial, 49 Freddie Mac Table of Contents accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled, adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions or new types of transactions or products could constrain our ability to pursue new business initiatives. We also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions. Any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our customers and manage our exposure to risk. Most of our key business activities are conducted in our principal offices located in McLean, Virginia. Despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities in which we are located. Potential disruptions may include those involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services we use or that are provided to us. If a disruption occurs and our employees are unable to occupy our offices or communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact with our customers or counterparties may suffer and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. We are exposed to the risk that a catastrophic event, such as a terrorist event or natural disaster, could result in a significant business disruption and an inability to process transactions through normal business processes. Any measures we take to mitigate this risk may not be sufficient to respond to the full range of catastrophic events that may occur. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize confidential and other information, including nonpublic personal information and sensitive business data, processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or counterparties, which could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are not fully insured. We rely on third parties for certain important functions, including some that are critical to financial reporting, our mortgage-related investment activity and mortgage loan underwriting. Any failures by those vendors could disrupt our business operations. We outsource certain key functions to external parties, including but not limited to: (a) processing functions for trade capture, market risk management analytics, and financial instrument valuation; (b) custody and recordkeeping for our mortgage-related investments; (c) processing functions for mortgage loan underwriting; and (d) certain services we provide to Treasury in our role as program compliance agent under HAMP. We may enter into other key outsourcing relationships in the future. If one or more of these key external parties were not able to perform their functions for a period of time, at an acceptable service level, or for increased volumes, our business operations could be constrained, disrupted or otherwise negatively impacted. Our use of vendors also exposes us to the risk of a loss of intellectual property or of confidential information or other harm. Financial or operational difficulties of an outside vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendors ability to provide services to us. Our risk management and loss mitigation efforts may not effectively mitigate the risks we seek to manage. We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor and mitigate operational risks, interest rate and other market risks and credit risks related to our business. Our risk management policies, procedures and techniques may not be sufficient to mitigate the risks we have identified or to appropriately identify additional risks to which we are subject. See QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK and MD&A  RISK MANAGEMENT for a discussion of our approach to managing the risks we face. Legal and Regulatory Risks The future status and role of Freddie Mac could be materially adversely affected by legislative and regulatory action that alters the ownership, structure and mission of the company. Future legislation will likely materially affect the role of the company, our business model, our structure and future results of operations. Some or all of our functions could be transferred to other institutions, and we could cease to exist as a stockholder-owned company or at all. If any of these events were to occur, our shares could further diminish in value, or cease to have any value, and there can be no assurance that our stockholders would receive any compensation for such loss in value. 50 Freddie Mac Table of Contents On June 17, 2009, the Obama Administration announced a legislative proposal to overhaul the regulatory structure of the financial services industry. The proposal does not address the regulatory oversight or structure of Freddie Mac. However, the proposal states that Treasury and HUD are expected to consult with other government agencies and develop recommendations for the future of Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Separately, Treasury Secretary Geithner and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Frank have both expressed support for substantially reforming the structure of the GSE model. Representatives of the Obama Administration have indicated that the Administration will release a statement regarding the future of the GSEs in the near future. In addition to legislative actions, FHFA has expansive regulatory authority over us, and the manner in which FHFA will use its authority in the future is unclear. FHFA could take a number of regulatory actions that could materially adversely affect our company, such as changing our current capital requirements, which are not binding during conservatorship. Legislation or regulation affecting the financial services, mortgage and investment banking industries may adversely affect our business activities and financial results. We expect that the financial services, mortgage and investment banking industries will face increased regulation, whether by legislation or regulatory actions at the federal or state level. Congress and state legislatures are considering several legislative and regulatory actions that would impact our business activities. These actions include among other things, regulatory oversight of systemically important financial institutions and reforms related to asset-backed securitization, consumer financial protection, over-the-counter derivatives and mortgage lending. We could be subject to new and additional regulatory oversight and standards related to our activities, products and capital adequacy and exposed to increased liability or credit losses. We could also be adversely affected by any legislative or regulatory changes to existing bankruptcy laws or proceedings or the foreclosure process, including any changes that would allow bankruptcy judges to unilaterally change the terms of mortgage loans. In addition, legislation or regulatory actions could indirectly affect us to the extent such legislation or actions affect the activities of banks, savings institutions, insurance companies, securities dealers and other regulated entities that constitute a significant part of our customer base or counterparties. Legislative or regulatory provisions that create or remove incentives for these entities to sell mortgage loans to us, purchase our securities or enter into derivatives or other transactions with us could have a material adverse effect on our business results and financial condition. Our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to return to long-term profitability may be affected by the nature, extent and success of the actions taken by the U.S. government to stabilize the economy and the housing and financial markets. Conditions in the overall economy, and the mortgage markets in particular, may be affected in both the short and long-term by the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the Recovery Act, the Financial Stability Plan announced by Treasury Secretary Geithner on February 10, 2009 and the MHA Program. The long-term impact that the implementation of these, or any future, laws and programs may have on our business and on the financial markets is uncertain. While the financial markets appear to have stabilized, there can be no assurance that this will continue. Any worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or access to the debt markets. The government could implement new laws or programs to support the economy and the housing and financial markets that could have an adverse effect on our business, including by increasing our credit losses. We may make certain changes to our business in an attempt to meet the housing goals and subgoals set for us by FHFA that may increase our losses. We may make adjustments to our mortgage sourcing and purchase strategies in an effort to meet our housing goals and subgoals, including changes to our underwriting guidelines and the expanded use of targeted initiatives to reach underserved populations. For example, we may purchase loans and mortgage-related securities that offer lower expected returns on our investment and increase our exposure to credit losses. Doing so could cause us to forgo other purchase opportunities that we would expect to be more profitable. If our current efforts to meet the goals and subgoals prove to be insufficient, we may need to take additional steps that could further increase our losses. We are involved in legal proceedings, governmental investigations and IRS examinations that could result in the payment of substantial damages or otherwise harm our business. We are a party to various legal actions, and are subject to investigations by the SEC and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. In addition, certain of our current and former directors, officers and employees are involved in legal proceedings for which they may be entitled to reimbursement by us for costs and expenses of the proceedings. The defense of these or any future claims or proceedings could divert managements attention and resources from the needs of the business. We may be required to establish reserves and to make substantial payments in the event of adverse judgments 51 Freddie Mac Table of Contents or settlements of any such claims, investigations, proceedings or examinations. Any legal proceeding, governmental investigation or examination issue, even if resolved in our favor, could result in negative publicity or cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses. Furthermore, developments in, outcomes of, impacts of, and costs, expenses, settlements and judgments related to these legal proceedings and governmental investigations and examinations may differ from our expectations and exceed any amounts for which we have reserved or require adjustments to such reserves. See LEGAL PROCEEDINGS for information about our pending legal proceedings and NOTE 15: INCOME TAXES to our consolidated financial statements for information about IRS examinations. ITEM 1B.
