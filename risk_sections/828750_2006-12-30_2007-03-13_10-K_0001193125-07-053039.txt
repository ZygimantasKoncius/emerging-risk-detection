ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS Risk Factors Any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks occur, our business could be materially harmed. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not necessarily known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. All statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, as defined under federal securities law. The words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, will, would, should, guidance, potential, continue, project, forecast, confident, prospects, schedule, and similar expressions typically are used to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on the then-current expectations, beliefs, assumptions, estimates and forecasts about our business. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors which may affect our business, financial condition and operating results include the effects of changes in the economy, consumer spending, the financial markets and the industries in which we and our partners operate, changes affecting the Internet and e-commerce, our ability to develop and maintain relationships with strategic partners and suppliers and the timing of our establishment, extension or termination of our relationships with strategic partners, our ability to timely and successfully develop, maintain and protect our technology, confidential and proprietary information, and product and service offerings and execute operationally, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions of other businesses, if any, the performance of acquired businesses and the impact of SFAS123(R). More information about potential factors that could affect us is provided below. We expressly disclaim any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Risks Related to Our Business Our future success cannot be predicted based upon our limited operating history. Compared to certain of our current and potential competitors, we have a relatively short operating history. In addition, the nature of our business and the e-commerce industry in which we operate has undergone rapid development and change since we began operating in e-commerce. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict whether we will be successful. Thus, our chances of financial and operational success should be evaluated in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses, delays and difficulties associated with operating a business with limited history in a relatively rapidly changing industry. If we are unable to address these issues, we may not be financially or operationally successful. Our failure to manage growth and diversification of our business could harm us. We are continuing to grow and diversify our business both in the United States and internationally. As a result, we must expand and adapt our operational infrastructure and increase the number of our personnel in certain areas. To effectively manage our growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. These enhancements and improvements are likely to be complex and will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. If we are unable to adapt our systems in a timely manner to accommodate our growth, our business may be adversely affected. 11 Table of Contents We have an accumulated deficit and may incur additional losses. Although we recorded net income in the last two fiscal years, we incurred net losses in the previous four fiscal years while operating our business. As of the end of fiscal 2006, we had an accumulated deficit of $120.3 million. We may not generate sufficient revenue and gross profit from our existing partners, add an appropriate number of new partners or adequately control our expenses. If we fail to do this, we may not be able to maintain profitability. We will continue to incur significant operating expenses and capital expenditures as we seek to:  launch new partners;  enhance our fulfillment capabilities and increase fulfillment capacity;  develop new technologies and features to improve our partners e-commerce businesses;  enhance our customer care center capabilities to better serve customers needs and increase customer care capacity;  improve our marketing and design capabilities;  increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations;  continue our business development, sales and marketing activities; and  make strategic or opportunistic acquisitions of complementary or new businesses or assets or internally develop new business initiatives. If we incur expenses at a greater pace than our revenues, we could incur additional losses. We may in the future need additional debt or equity financing to continue our growth. Such additional financing may not be available on satisfactory terms or it may not be available when needed, or at all. We have funded the growth of our e-commerce business primarily from the sale of equity securities and through the issuance of convertible notes. If our cash flows are insufficient to fund our growth, we may in the future need to seek additional equity or debt financings or reduce costs. Further, we may not be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or it may not be available when needed, or at all. Our inability to finance our growth, either internally or externally, may limit our growth potential and our ability to execute our business strategy. If we issue securities to raise capital, our existing stockholders may experience dilution or the new securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock. In addition, the terms of these securities could impose restrictions on our operations. Seasonal fluctuations in sales cause wide fluctuations in our quarterly results. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues. These seasonal patterns have caused and will continue to cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results. Our results of operations historically have been seasonal primarily because consumers increase their purchases on our partners e-commerce businesses during the fourth quarter holiday season. Our fourth fiscal quarter has accounted for and is expected to continue to account for a disproportionate percentage of our total annual revenues. For fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, 42.4% and 40.5% of our annual net revenues were generated in our fiscal fourth quarter, respectively. Since fiscal 1999, we have not generated net income in any fiscal quarter other than a fiscal fourth quarter. If our revenues are below seasonal expectations during the fourth fiscal quarter or if we do not execute operationally, our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In the future, our seasonal sales patterns may become more pronounced, may strain our personnel, customer care operations, fulfillment operations, IT capacity and shipment activities and may cause a shortfall in revenues compared to expenses in a given period. 12 Table of Contents In addition, if too many consumers access our partners e-commerce businesses within a short period of time due to increased holiday or other demand or if we inaccurately forecast consumer traffic, we may experience system interruptions that make our partners e-commerce businesses unavailable or prevent us from transmitting orders to our fulfillment operations, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell as well as the attractiveness of our partners e-commerce businesses to consumers. In anticipation of increased sales activity during our fourth fiscal quarter, we and our partners increase our inventory levels. If we and our partners do not increase inventory levels for popular products in sufficient amounts or are unable to restock popular products in a timely manner, we and our partners may fail to meet customer demand which could reduce the attractiveness of our partners e-commerce businesses. Alternatively, if we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs, which could reduce profits. We have expanded into new categories and may expand into additional new categories in the future. If we do not successfully execute on the expansion of our operations into these new categories, our growth could be limited. While we have operated in e-commerce since 1999, we did not expand beyond the sporting goods category until 2001. Since 2001, our operations have expanded into 11 categories. Each category in which we operate requires unique capabilities and experience and increases the complexity of our business. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue in a category, we may not be able to cover the incremental staffing and expenses required to support the unique capabilities required by that category. If we do expand into new categories, there can be no assurance that we will do so successfully. Consumers are constantly changing their buying preferences. If we fail to anticipate these changes and adjust our inventory accordingly, we could experience lower sales, higher inventory markdowns and lower margins for the inventory that we own. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability and our partners ability to anticipate and respond to consumer trends with respect to products sold through the e-commerce businesses we operate. Consumers tastes are subject to frequent and significant changes. In order to be successful, we and our partners must accurately predict consumers tastes and avoid overstocking or understocking products. If we or our partners fail to identify and respond to changes in merchandising and consumer preferences, sales on our partners e-commerce businesses could suffer and we or our partners could be required to mark down unsold inventory. This would depress our profit margins. In addition, any failure to keep pace with changes in consumers tastes could result in lost opportunities which could reduce sales. High merchandise returns or shrinkage rates could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot be assured that inventory loss and theft, or shrinkage, and merchandise returns will not increase in the future. If merchandise returns are significant, or our shrinkage rate increases, our revenues and costs of operations could be adversely affected. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to add and launch new partners on a timely basis and on favorable terms and to extend the length of existing partner agreements on favorable terms. Key elements of our growth strategy include adding new partners, extending the length of existing partner agreements on favorable terms and growing the business of our existing partners. If we are unable to add our targeted amount of new business, partners with good reputations or new partners on favorable terms, our growth may be limited. If we are unable to add and launch new partners within the time frames projected by us, we may not be able to achieve our targeted results in the expected periods. In addition, our ability to add new partners and retain and renew existing partners depends on the quality of the services we provide and our reputation. To the extent that we have difficulties with the quality of the services we provide or have operational issues that adversely affect our reputation, it could adversely impact our ability to add new partners, retain and renew 13 Table of Contents existing partners and grow the business of our existing partners. Because competition for new partners is intense, we may not be able to add new partners on favorable terms, or at all. Further, our ability to add new partners on favorable terms is dependent on our success in building and retaining our sales organization and investing in infrastructure to serve new partners. Our success is tied to the success of the partners for which we operate e-commerce businesses. Our success is substantially dependent upon the success of the partners for which we operate e-commerce businesses. The retail business is intensely competitive. If our partners were to have financial difficulties or seek protection from their creditors or if they were to suffer impairment of their brand, it could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our business. Our business could also be adversely affected if our partners marketing, brands or retail stores are not successful or if our partners reduce their marketing or number of retail stores. Additionally, a change in management at our partners could adversely affect our relationship with those partners and our revenue from our agreements with those partners. As a result of our relationship with certain of our partners, these partners identify, buy, and bear the financial risk of inventory obsolescence for their corresponding web stores and merchandise. As a result, if any of these partners fail to forecast product demand or optimize or maintain access to inventory, we would receive reduced service fees under the agreements and our business and reputation could be harmed. We enter into contracts with our partners. We derived 52.9% of our revenue in fiscal 2006 and 40.5% gross profit from five partners e-commerce businesses. If we do not maintain good working relationships with our partners, or perform as required under these agreements, it could adversely affect our business. The contracts with our partners establish complex relationships between our partners and us. We spend a significant amount of time and effort to maintain our relationships with our partners and address the issues that from time to time may arise from these complex relationships. For fiscal 2006, sales to customers through one of our partners e-commerce businesses accounted for 14.9% of our revenue, sales to customers through another one of our partners e-commerce businesses accounted for 13.9% of our revenue. For fiscal 2006, sales through our top five partners e-commerce businesses accounted for 52.9% of our revenue or 40.5% of our gross profit. For fiscal 2005, sales to customers through one of our partners e-commerce businesses accounted for 25.6% of our revenue, sales through another one of our partners e-commerce businesses accounted for 12.8% of our revenue. For fiscal 2005, sales through our top five partners e-commerce businesses accounted for 61.3% of our revenue or 45.0% of our gross profit. Our partners could decide not to renew their agreements at the end of their respective terms. Additionally, if we do not perform as required under these agreements, our partners could seek to terminate their agreements prior to the end of their respective terms or seek damages from us. Loss of our existing partners, particularly our major partners, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We and our partners must develop and maintain relationships with key manufacturers to obtain a sufficient assortment and quantity of quality merchandise on acceptable commercial terms. If we or our partners are unable to do so, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For the e-commerce businesses for which we own inventory, we primarily purchase products from the manufacturers and distributors of the products. For the e-commerce businesses for which our partners own inventory, our partners typically purchase products from the manufacturers and distributors of products or source their own products. If we or our partners are unable to develop and maintain relationships with these manufacturers, distributors or sources, we or our partners may be unable to obtain or continue to carry a sufficient assortment and quantity of quality merchandise on acceptable commercial terms and our partners e-commerce businesses and our business could be adversely impacted. We do not have written contracts with some of our manufacturers, distributors or sources. During fiscal 2006, we purchased 28.6% of the total amount of inventory we purchased from one manufacturer. In addition, during fiscal 2005, we purchased 40.0% of the total amount of inventory we purchased from the same manufacturer. While we have a contract with this 14 Table of Contents manufacturer, this manufacturer and other manufacturers could stop selling products to us or our partners and may ask us or our partners to remove their products or logos from our partners Web sites. If we or our partners are unable to obtain products directly from manufacturers, especially popular brand manufacturers, we or our partners may not be able to obtain the same or comparable merchandise in a timely manner or on acceptable commercial terms. We rely on our ability to enter into marketing and promotional agreements with online services, search engines, comparison shopping sites, affiliate marketers other Web sites to drive traffic to the e-commerce businesses we operate. If we are unable to enter into or properly develop these marketing and promotional agreements, our ability to generate revenue could be adversely affected. In addition, new technologies could block our ads and manipulate web search results, which could harm our business. We have entered into marketing and promotional agreements with search engines, comparison shopping sites, affiliate marketers and other Web sites to provide content, advertising banners and other links to our partners e-commerce businesses. We rely on these agreements as significant sources of traffic to our partners e-commerce businesses and to generate new customers. If we are unable to maintain these relationships or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms, our ability to attract new customers could be harmed. Further, many of the parties with which we may have online advertising arrangements provide advertising services for other marketers of goods. As a result, these parties may be reluctant to enter into or maintain relationships with us. In addition, technologies may be developed that can block the display of our ads and could harm our ability to contact customers. Further, index spammers who develop ways to manipulate web search results could reduce the traffic that is directed to our partners e-commerce businesses. Failure to achieve sufficient traffic or generate sufficient revenue from purchases originating from third parties may limit our partners and our ability to maintain market share and revenue. In addition, we contact customers through e-mail. Our ability to contact customers through e-mail could be harmed and our business may be adversely affected if we mistakenly end up on SPAM lists, or lists of entities that have been involved in sending unwanted, unsolicited e-mails. If we experience problems in our fulfillment operations, our business could be adversely affected. Although we operate our own fulfillment centers, we rely upon multiple third parties for the shipment of our products. We also rely upon certain vendors to ship products directly to consumers. As a result, we are subject to the risks associated with the ability of these vendors and other third parties to successfully and in a timely manner fulfill and ship customer orders. The failure of these vendors and other third parties to provide these services, or the termination or interruption of these services, could adversely affect the satisfaction of consumers, which could result in reduced sales by our partners e-commerce businesses. In addition, if third parties were to increase the prices they charge to ship our products, and we passed these increases on to consumers, consumers might choose to buy comparable products locally to avoid shipping charges. Under some of our partner agreements, we maintain the inventory of our partners in our fulfillment centers. Our failure to properly handle and protect such inventory could adversely affect our relationship with our partners. In addition, because it is difficult to predict demand, we may not manage our fulfillment centers in an optimal way, which may result in excess or insufficient inventory or warehousing, fulfillment, and distribution capacity. We may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment centers. As we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability or add new partners with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging. In addition, our financial systems and equipment are complex and any additions, changes or upgrades to these systems or equipment could cause disruptions that could harm our business. 15 Table of Contents A disruption in our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any disruption to our operations, including system, network, telecommunications, software or hardware failures, and any damage to our physical locations, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are subject to the risk of damage or interruption from:  fire, flood, hurricane, tornado, earthquake or other natural disasters;  power losses and interruptions;  Internet, telecommunications or data network failures;  physical and electronic break-ins or security breaches;  computer viruses;  acts of terrorism; and  other similar events. If any of these events occur, it could result in interruptions, delays or cessations in service to customers of our partners e-commerce businesses and adversely impact our partners e-commerce businesses. These events could also prevent us from fulfilling orders for our partners e-commerce businesses. Our partners might seek significant compensation from us for their losses. Even if unsuccessful, this type of claim likely would be time consuming and costly for us to address and damaging to our reputation. Our primary data centers are located at two facilities of a third-party hosting company. We do not control the security, maintenance or operation of these facilities, which are also susceptible to similar disasters and problems. Our insurance policies may not cover us for losses related to these events, and even if they do, may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. Any system failure that causes an interruption of the availability of our partners e-commerce businesses could reduce the attractiveness of our partners e-commerce businesses to consumers and result in reduced revenues, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we do not respond to rapid technological changes, our services and proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete. The Internet and e-commerce are constantly changing. Due to the costs and management time required to introduce new services and enhancements, we may be unable to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely enough manner to avoid our services becoming uncompetitive. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our partners e-commerce businesses. If competitors introduce new services using new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our partners existing e-commerce businesses and our services and proprietary technology and systems may become uncompetitive and our ability to attract and retain customers and new partners may be at risk. Developing our e-commerce platform offering, our partners e-commerce businesses and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. We may use new technologies ineffectively or fail to adapt our e-commerce platform, our partners e-commerce businesses and our technology to meet the requirements of partners and customers or emerging industry standards. In addition, the new technologies may be challenging to develop and implement and may cause us to incur substantial costs. Additionally, the vendors we use for our partners e-commerce businesses may not provide the level of service we expect or may not be able to provide their product or service to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 16 Table of Contents Our success is tied to the continued growth in the use of the Internet and the adequacy of the Internet infrastructure. Our future success is substantially dependent upon continued growth in the use of the Internet. The number of users and advertisers on the Internet may not increase and commerce over the Internet may not continue to grow for a number of reasons, including:  actual or perceived lack of security of information or privacy protection;  lack of access and ease of use;  congestion of traffic on the Internet;  inconsistent quality of service and lack of availability of cost-effective, high-speed service;  possible disruptions, computer viruses or other damage to Internet servers or to users computers;  governmental regulation;  uncertainty regarding intellectual property ownership;  lack of access to high-speed communications equipment; and  increases in the cost of accessing the Internet. As currently configured, the Internet may not support an increase in the number or requirements of users. In addition, there have been outages and delays on the Internet as a result of damage to the current infrastructure. The amount of traffic on our partners Web sites could decline materially if there are outages or delays in the future. The use of the Internet may also decline if there are delays in the development or adoption of modifications by third parties that are required to support increased levels of activity on the Internet. If any of the foregoing occurs, the number of our partners customers could decrease. In addition, we may be required to spend significant capital to adapt our operations to any new or emerging technologies relating to the Internet. Consumers may be unwilling to use the Internet to purchase goods. Our future success depends heavily upon the general publics willingness to use the Internet as a means to purchase goods. The failure of the Internet to continue to develop as an effective commercial tool would seriously damage our future operations. If consumers are unwilling to use the Internet to conduct business, our business may not continue to grow. The Internet may not continue to succeed as a medium of commerce because of security risks and delays in developing elements of the needed Internet infrastructure, such as a reliable network, high-speed communication lines and other enabling technologies. In addition, anything that diverts our users from their customary level of usage of our websites could adversely affect our business. Third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of customer transaction data and confidential information stored on our servers. Any breach could cause customers to lose confidence in the security of our partners e-commerce businesses and choose not to purchase from those businesses. Our security measures may not effectively prevent others from obtaining improper access to the information on our partners e-commerce businesses. If someone is able to circumvent our security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt the operation of our partners e-commerce businesses. Concerns about the security and privacy of transactions over the Internet could inhibit our growth. We and/or our partners may be unable to protect our and their proprietary technology and intellectual property rights or keep up with that of competitors. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our intellectual property rights in the core technology and other components of our e-commerce platform including our software and other proprietary information and material, and our ability to develop technologies that are as good as or better than our 17 Table of Contents competitors. We may be unable to deter infringement or misappropriation of our software and other proprietary information and material, detect unauthorized use or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. In addition, the failure of our partners to protect their intellectual property rights, including their trademarks and domain names, could impair our operations. Our competitors could, without violating our intellectual property rights, develop technologies that are as good as or better than our technology. Protecting our intellectual property and other proprietary rights can be expensive. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and consequently harm our operating results. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in our software and other information and material or to develop technologies that are as good as or better than our competitors could put us at a disadvantage to our competitors. These failures could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be subject to intellectual property claims or competition or trade practices claims that could be costly and could disrupt our business. Third parties may assert that our business or technologies infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights. Third parties may claim that we do not have the right to offer certain services or products or to present specific images or logos on our partners e-commerce businesses, or we have infringed their patents, trademarks, copyrights or other rights. We may in the future receive claims that we are engaging in unfair competition or other illegal trade practices. We may be unsuccessful in defending against these claims, which could result in substantial damages, fines or other penalties. The resolution of a claim could also require us to change how we do business, redesign our service offering or partners e-commerce businesses or enter into burdensome royalty or license agreements. These license or royalty agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, in the event of a successful claim of infringement. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover every claim that third parties could assert against us. Even unsuccessful claims could result in significant legal fees and other expenses, diversion of managements time and disruptions in our business. Any of these claims could also harm our reputation. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, which could harm our margins and our business. The market for the development and operation of e-commerce businesses is continuously evolving and is intensely competitive. Increased competition could result in fewer successful opportunities to partner, price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We often compete with in-house solutions promoted and supported by internal information technology staffs, marketing departments, merchandising groups and other internal corporate constituencies. In these situations, we compete with technology and service providers, which supply one or more components of an e-commerce solution primarily to allow the prospect or others to develop and operate the prospects e-commerce business in-house. When prospects are open to broader and more integrated service offerings, we compete with companies, primarily the Services Division of Amazon.com, that offer a full range of e-commerce services similar to the services we provide through our e-commerce platform. In addition, we compete with the online and offline businesses of a variety of retailers and manufacturers in our targeted categories. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. They may be able to secure merchandise from vendors on more favorable terms and may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies. They may also receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger, well-established companies with greater financial resources. Competitors in both the retail and e-commerce services industries also may be able to devote more resources to technology development and marketing than we do. Competition in the e-commerce industry may intensify. Other companies in the retail and e-commerce service industries may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. 18 Table of Contents Additionally, there are relatively low barriers to entry into the e-commerce market. As various Internet market segments obtain large, loyal customer bases, participants in those segments may expand into the market segments in which we operate. In addition, new and expanded Web technologies may further intensify the competitive nature of online retail. The nature of the Internet as an electronic marketplace facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and renders it inherently more competitive than conventional retailing formats. This increased competition may reduce our sales, our ability to operate profitably, or both. We may be subject to product liability claims that could be costly and time-consuming. We sell products manufactured by third parties, some of which may be defective. We also sell some products that are manufactured by third parties for us. If any product that we sell were to cause physical injury or injury to property, the injured party or parties could bring claims against us as the retailer or manufacturer of the product. These claims may not be covered by insurance and, even if they are, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover every claim that could be asserted. Similarly, we could be subject to claims that customers of our partners e-commerce businesses were harmed due to their reliance on our product information, product selection guides, advice or instructions. If a successful claim were brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, it could adversely affect our business. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and management time and adverse publicity and could have a negative impact on our business. We may be liable if third parties misappropriate our customers personal information. Additionally, we are limited in our ability to use and disclose customer information. Any security breach could expose us to risks of loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations. If third parties are able to penetrate our network or telecommunications security or otherwise misappropriate our customers personal information or credit card information or if we give third parties improper access to our customers personal information or credit card information, we could be subject to liability. This liability could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. They could also include claims for other misuses of personal information, including unauthorized marketing purposes. These claims could result in litigation. Liability for misappropriation of this information could be significant. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and state agencies regularly investigate various companies uses of customers personal information. We could incur additional expenses if new regulations regarding the security or use of personal information are introduced or if government agencies investigate our privacy practices. Further, any resulting adverse publicity arising from investigations would impact our business negatively. Changes to credit card association fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. We must rely on banks or payment processors to process transactions, and must pay a fee for this service. From time to time, credit card associations may increase the interchange fees that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards. Our credit card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. These increased fees increase our operating costs and reduce our profit margins. We are also required by our processors to comply with credit card association operating rules, and we will reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by credit card associations as a result of any rule violations by us. The credit card associations and their member banks set and interpret operating rules related to their credit cards. The credit card associations and/or member banks could adopt new operating rules or re-interpret existing rules that we might find difficult or even impossible to follow. As a result, we could lose our ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments. If we were unable to accept credit cards, our business would be seriously damaged. Credit card fraud could adversely affect our business. We do not carry insurance against the risk of credit card fraud, so the failure to adequately control fraudulent transactions could increase our expenses. To date, we have not suffered material losses due to fraud. 19 Table of Contents However, we may in the future suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data. Under current credit card practices, we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because we do not obtain a cardholders signature. With respect to checks and installment sales, we generally are liable for fraudulent transactions. If one or more states successfully assert that we should collect or should have collected sales or other taxes on the sale of our merchandise, our business could be harmed. We currently collect sales or other similar taxes only for goods sold by us and shipped into certain states. One or more local, state or foreign jurisdictions may seek to impose historical and future sales tax obligations on us or our partners and other out-of-state companies that engage in e-commerce. In recent years, certain large retailers expanded their collection of sales tax on purchases made through affiliated Web sites. Our business could be adversely affected if one or more states or any foreign country successfully asserts that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise through the e-commerce businesses we operate. We rely on insurance to mitigate some risks and, to the extent the cost of insurance increases or we are unable or choose not to maintain sufficient insurance to mitigate the risks facing our business, our operating results may be diminished. We contract for insurance to cover certain potential risks and liabilities. In the current environment, insurance companies are increasingly specific about what they will and will not insure. It is possible that we may not be able to get enough insurance to meet our needs, may have to pay very high prices for the coverage we do get, have very high deductibles or may not be able to acquire any insurance for certain types of business risk. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future choose not to obtain insurance for certain risks facing our business. This could leave us exposed to potential claims. If we were found liable for a significant claim in the future, our operating results could be negatively impacted. Also, to the extent the cost of maintaining insurance increases, our operating results will be negatively affected. Existing or future law or regulations could harm our business or marketing efforts. We are subject to international, federal, state and local laws applicable to businesses in general and to e-commerce specifically. Due to the increasing growth and popularity of the Internet and e-commerce, many laws and regulations relating to the Internet and online retailing are proposed and considered at the country, federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations could cover issues such as taxation, pricing, content, distribution, access, quality and delivery of products and services, electronic contracts, intellectual property rights, user privacy and information security. For example, at least one state has enacted, and other states have proposed, legislation limiting the uses of personal information collected online or requiring collectors of information to establish procedures to disclose and notify users of privacy and security policies, obtain consent from users for use and disclosure of information, or provide users with the ability to access, correct and delete stored information. Even in the absence of such legislation, the Federal Trade Commission has settled several proceedings resulting in consent decrees in which Internet companies have been required to establish programs regulating the manner in which personal information is collected from users and provided to third parties. We could become a party to a similar enforcement proceeding. These regulatory and enforcement efforts could also harm our ability to collect demographic and personal information from users, which could be costly or adversely affect our marketing efforts. The applicability of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, intellectual property rights, taxation, libel, obscenity, qualification to do business and export or import matters could also harm our business. Many of these laws may not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet or online retailing. Some laws that do contemplate or address those unique issues, such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, are only beginning to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain. These current and future laws and regulations could reduce our ability to operate efficiently. 20 Table of Contents From time to time, we may acquire or invest in other companies. There are risks associated with potential acquisitions and investments and we may not achieve the expected benefits of future acquisitions and investments. If we are presented with appropriate opportunities, we may make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies or we may purchase other companies. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any investment or acquisition. We may be subject to unanticipated problems and liabilities of acquired companies. We may not be able to successfully assimilate the additional personnel, operations, acquired technology or products or services into our business. Any acquisition may strain our existing financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures. If we do not successfully integrate any acquired business, the expenditures on integration efforts will reduce our cash position without us being able to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition. In addition, key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. Further, the physical expansion in facilities that could occur as a result of any acquisition may result in disruptions that could seriously impair our business. Finally, we may have to use our cash resources, incur debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for other acquisitions or investments, which could increase our leverage or be dilutive to our stockholders. We plan to continue to expand our business internationally which may cause our business to become increasingly susceptible to numerous international business risks and challenges. We believe that the current globalization of the economy requires businesses to consider pursuing international expansion. We ship certain products to Canada and other countries. In addition, in January 2006, we completed an acquisition of Aspherio, a Barcelona, Spain-based provider of outsourced e-commerce solutions, now known as GSI Commerce Europe. We may continue to expand our international efforts. International expansion is subject to inherent risks and challenges that could adversely affect our business, including:  the need to develop new supplier and manufacturer relationships, particularly because major manufacturers may require that our international operations deal with local distributors;  compliance with international legal and regulatory requirements and tariffs;  managing fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;  potential adverse tax consequences;  uncertain political and economic climates;  potentially higher incidence of fraud;  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currency; and  difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and compliance with applicable export controls. Any negative impact from our international business efforts could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition as a whole. In addition, gains and losses on the conversion of foreign payments into U.S. dollars may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and fluctuating exchange rates could cause reduced revenues and/or gross margins from non-dollar-denominated international sales. In addition, if we further expand internationally, we may face additional competition challenges. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer. In addition, governments in foreign jurisdictions may regulate e-commerce or other online services in such areas as content, privacy, network security, copyright, encryption, taxation, or distribution. We also may not be able to hire, train, motivate and manage the required personnel, which may limit our growth in international market segments. 21 Table of Contents In addition, compliance with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and our international operations could expose us to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these regulations. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Any violations of such laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial fines or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our international expansion efforts, our business and our operating results. The uncertainty regarding the general economy may reduce our revenues. Our revenue and rate of growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products offered by our partners, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions. A decrease in demand, whether caused by changes in consumer spending or a weakening of the U.S. economy or the local economies outside of the United States where we sell products, may result in decreased revenue or growth. Terrorist attacks and armed hostilities could create economic and consumer uncertainty that could adversely affect our revenue or growth. Our success is dependent upon our executive officers and other key personnel. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the contribution of our executive officers and other key personnel, particularly Michael G. Rubin, chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Our executive officers and key personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time despite any employment agreements we may have with these employees. Due to the competition for highly qualified personnel, we cannot be sure that we will be able to retain or attract executive, managerial or other key personnel. We have obtained key person life insurance for Mr. Rubin in the amount of $9.0 million. We have not obtained key person life insurance for any of our other executive officers or key personnel. We may be unable to hire and retain skilled personnel which could limit our growth. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate skilled personnel which could limit our growth. We intend to continue to seek to hire a significant number of skilled personnel. Due to intense competition for these individuals from our competitors and other employers, we may not be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel in the future. Our failure to attract and retain the experienced and highly trained personnel that are integral to our business may limit our growth. Additionally, we have experienced recent growth in personnel numbers and expect to continue to hire additional personnel in selected areas. Managing this growth requires significant time and resource commitments from our senior management. If we are unable to effectively manage a large and geographically dispersed group of employees or to anticipate our future growth and personnel needs, our business may be adversely affected. There are limitations on the liabilities of our directors and executive officers. Under certain circumstances, we are obligated to indemnify our directors and executive officers against liability and expenses incurred by them in their service to us. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and under Delaware law, our directors are not liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty, except for liability for breach of a directors duty of loyalty, acts or omissions by a director not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, dividend payments or stock repurchases that are unlawful under Delaware law or any transaction in which a director has derived an improper personal benefit. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. These agreements, among other things, require us to indemnify each director and executive officer for certain expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts, incurred by any such person in any action or proceeding, including any action by us or in our right, arising out of the persons services as one of our directors 22 Table of Contents or executive officers. The costs associated with actions requiring indemnification under these agreements could be harmful to our business. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders and partners could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business, the trading price of our common stock and our ability to retain our current partners and obtain new partners. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended significant resources to comply with our obligations under Section 404 with respect to fiscal 2006. If we fail to correct any issues in the design or operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting or fail to prevent fraud, current and potential stockholders and partners could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business, the trading price of our common stock and our ability to retain our current partners and obtain new partners. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly, which may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile. Our annual and quarterly operating results have and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Because our operating results may be volatile and difficult to predict, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance. Our operating results may also fall below our published expectations and the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which likely will cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. Factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate or harm our business include but are not limited to the following:  our ability to obtain new partners or to retain existing partners;  the performance of one or more of our partners e-commerce businesses;  our and our partners ability to obtain new customers at a reasonable cost or encourage repeat purchases;  the number of visitors to the e-commerce businesses operated by us or our ability to convert these visitors into customers;  our and our partners ability to offer an appealing mix of products or to sell products that we purchase;  our ability to adequately develop, maintain and upgrade our partners e-commerce businesses or the technology and systems we use to process customers orders and payments;  the timing and costs of upgrades and developments of our systems and infrastructure;  the ability of our competitors to offer new or superior e-commerce businesses, services or products;  price competition that results in lower profit margins or losses;  the seasonality of our business, especially the importance of our fiscal fourth quarter to our business;  our inability to obtain or develop specific products or brands or unwillingness of vendors to sell their products to us;  unanticipated fluctuations in the amount of consumer spending on various products that we sell, which tend to be discretionary spending items;  the cost of advertising and the amount of free shipping and other promotions we offer;  increases in the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our operations; 23 Table of Contents  our inability to manage our shipping costs on a profitable basis or unexpected increases in shipping costs or delivery times, particularly during the holiday season;  inflation of prices of fuel and gasoline and other raw material that impact our costs;  technical difficulties, system security breaches, system downtime or Internet slowdowns;  our inability to manage inventory levels or control inventory shrinkage;  our inability to manage fulfillment operations or provide adequate levels of customer care or our inability to forecast the proper staffing levels in fulfillment and customer care;  an increase in the level of our product returns or our inability to effectively process returns;  government regulations related to the Internet or e-commerce which could increase the costs associated with operating our businesses, including requiring the collection of sales tax on all purchases through the e-commerce businesses we operate; and  unfavorable economic conditions in general or specific to the Internet or e-commerce, which could reduce demand for the products sold through our partners e-commerce businesses. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate that any cash dividends will be declared or paid in the foreseeable future. As a result, holders of our common stock will not receive a return, if any, on their investment unless they sell their shares of our common stock. We are controlled by certain principal stockholders. As of March 1, 2007, Michael G. Rubin, our chairman and chief executive officer, beneficially owned 16.3%, funds affiliated with SOFTBANK Holdings Inc., or SOFTBANK, beneficially owned 17.7%, and Liberty Media Corporation, through its subsidiary QVC, Inc. and QVCs affiliate QK Holdings, Inc. beneficially owned approximately 20.1% of our outstanding common stock, including options to purchase common stock, which are exercisable on or before April 30, 2007. If they decide to act together, any two of Mr. Rubin, SOFTBANK, and Liberty would be in a position to exercise considerable control, and all three would be in a position to exercise complete control, over most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election or removal of directors, approval of significant corporate transactions and the ability generally to direct our affairs. Furthermore, pursuant to stock purchase agreements, SOFTBANK and Liberty each have the right to designate up to one member of our board of directors. This concentration of ownership and the right of SOFTBANK and Liberty to designate members to our board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock. Furthermore, Mr. Rubin has entered into voting agreements with each of SOFTBANK and Liberty, and SOFTBANK and Liberty have entered into voting agreements with each other. The parties to these voting agreements have agreed to support the election of the directors designated by each of the other parties. It may be difficult for a third-party to acquire us and this could depress our stock price. Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws, stockholder rights agreement and Delaware law may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing transactions that involve any actual or threatened change in control. The rights issued under our stockholder rights agreement may be a substantial deterrent to a person acquiring beneficial ownership of 20% or more (or, in the case of any stockholder that as of April 2, 2006 beneficially owned 19% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, 25.1% or more) of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors. The stockholder rights agreement would cause extreme dilution to such person. 24 Table of Contents In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to certain exceptions, restricts certain transactions and business combinations between a corporation and a stockholder owning 15% or more of the corporations outstanding voting stock for a period of three years from the date the stockholder becomes a 15% stockholder. In addition to discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire control of us, the foregoing provisions could impair the ability of existing stockholders to remove and replace our management and/or our board of directors. Because many investors consider a change of control a desirable path to liquidity, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company may reduce the number of investors interested in our common stock, which could depress our stock price. See  We are controlled by certain principal stockholders. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. The price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market has been volatile. During fiscal 2006, the high and low sale prices of our common stock ranged from $10.67 to $19.52 per share. During fiscal 2005, the high and low sale prices of our common stock ranged from $12.21 to $21.25 per share. We expect that the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate. Our common stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:  our performance and prospects;  the performance and prospects of our partners;  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;  investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate;  changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts;  general financial and other market conditions; and  general economic conditions. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Conversion of our convertible notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders. In June 2005, we issued $57.5 million principal amount of our convertible notes due 2025, which convertible notes will be convertible into shares of our common stock. Under certain circumstances, a maximum of 3,369,270 shares of common stock could be issued upon conversion of the convertible notes, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits and similar events. The conversion of some or all of the notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the notes could encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock. Holders of our common stock are subordinated to our convertible notes and other indebtedness. In the event of our liquidation or insolvency, holders of common stock would receive a distribution only after payment in full of all principal and interest due to holders of our convertible notes and other creditors, and there may be little or no proceeds to distribute to holders of common stock at such time. 25 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Indebtedness Our convertible notes could adversely affect our financial condition. We are not prohibited from incurring additional debt. On June 1, 2005, we completed an offering of $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes due 2025. Including these notes, we have approximately $70.9 million of indebtedness outstanding as of December 30, 2006. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  limit our ability to obtain additional financing;  require the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;  place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with less debt;  make it difficult or impossible for us to pay the principal amount of the convertible notes at maturity, thereby causing an event of default under the convertible notes; We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. The terms of the convertible notes will not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. If new debt is added, the related risks described above could intensify. In addition, in the event of default, the notes will become due prior to their stated maturity and it would adversely affect our financial condition; Holders of our common stock will be subordinated to our convertible notes and other indebtedness. In the event of our liquidation or insolvency, holders of common stock would receive a distribution only after payment in full of all principal and interest due to holders of our convertible notes and other creditors, and there may be little or no proceeds to distribute to holders of common stock at such time. ITEM 1B: UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. We, like other issuers, from time to time receive written comments from the staff of the SEC regarding our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act. There are no comments that remain unresolved that we received not less than 180 days before the end of fiscal 2006.
