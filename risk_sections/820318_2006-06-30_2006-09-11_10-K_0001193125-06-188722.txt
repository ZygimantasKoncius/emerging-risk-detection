Our first fiscal quarter results often are dependent upon the sales made in the last month of the quarter. Manufacturing Technology and Processes As noted in the Our Strategy section, many of the products we produce depend on our ability to manufacture technically challenging materials and components. The table below shows these key materials and the processes used to produce them. Product Line Materials Produced Principal Growth Processes Utilized  Infrared Optics ZnSe and ZnS Chemical Vapor Deposition  Near-Infrared Optics YAG, YLF, CaF2 and KNS Czochralski  Military Optics Ge Modified Bridgman  X-ray and Gamma-ray Sensors CdZnTe High Pressure Bridgman and Conventional Bridgman  Silicon Carbide Substrates SiC Physical Vapor Transport and Axial Gradient Transport  Thermoelectric Coolers Bi2Te3 High Pressure Bridgman The ability to produce these difficult materials and to control the quality and yields is an expertise of the Company. Processing of these materials into finished products is also difficult to accomplish; yet the quality and reproducibility of these products are critical to the performance of our customers instruments and systems. In the markets we serve there are a limited number of suppliers of many of the components we manufacture, and there are very few industry-standard products. Our network of worldwide manufacturing sites allows products to be produced in regions that provide cost-effective advantages and enable proximity to our customers. We employ numerous advanced manufacturing technologies and systems at our manufacturing facilities. These include automated, Computer Numeric Control optical fabrication, high throughput thin-film coaters, micro precision metrology and custom-engineered automated furnace controls for the crystal growth processes. Manufacturing products for use across the electromagnetic spectrum requires the capabilities to repeatedly produce products with high yields to atomic tolerances. We embody a technology and quality mindset that gives our customers the confidence to utilize our products on a just-in-time basis straight into the heart of their production lines. Sources of Supply The major raw materials we use include Zinc, Selenium, Hydrogen Selenide, Hydrogen Sulfide, Cadmium, Tellurium, Yttrium Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Iridium, Platinum, Bismuth, Silicon, Thorium Fluoride, Antimony and Carbon. We also purchase Gallium Arsenide, Copper, Silicon, Germanium, Molybdenum, Quartz, optical glass and other materials from outside vendors for use as base materials for laser optics. We purchase Thorium Fluoride and other materials for use in optical fabrication and coating processes. Excluding our own production, there are more than two external suppliers for all of the above materials except for Zinc Selenide, Zinc Sulfide, Hydrogen Selenide and Thorium Fluoride, for each of which there is one proven source of supply outside of the Companys capabilities. For many materials, we have entered into annual purchase arrangements whereby suppliers provide discounts for annual volume purchases in excess of specified amounts. The Company also owns a minority ownership interest in 5NPlus, Inc., a supplier of high-purity Cadmium, Zinc, Tellurium, Selenium and Antimony. The continued high quality and access to these materials is critical to the stability and predictability of our manufacturing yields. We conduct testing of materials at the onset of the production process. Additional research and 9 capital investment may be needed to better define future starting material specifications. We have not experienced significant production delays due to shortages of materials. However, we do occasionally experience problems associated with vendor supplied materials not meeting contract specifications for quality or purity. A significant failure of our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of necessary high-quality materials on a timely basis could have a materially adverse effect on the results of our operations.

In addition to competitors who manufacture products similar to those we produce, there are other technologies or materials that can compete with our products. Bookings and Backlog We define our bookings as customer orders received that are expected to be converted to revenues over the next twelve months. For long-term customer orders, the Company takes the view of not including in bookings the portion of the customer order that is beyond twelve months due to the inherent uncertainty of an order that far in the future. For the year ended June 30, 2006, our bookings were $242.3 million compared to bookings of $187.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2005. We define our backlog as bookings that have not been converted to revenues by the end of the reporting period. Bookings are adjusted if changes in customer demands or production schedules move a delivery beyond twelve months. As of June 30, 2006, our backlog was approximately $84.0 million compared to $75.5 million at June 30, 2005. Employees As of June 30, 2006, we employed 1,690 persons worldwide. Of these employees, 201 were engaged in research, development and engineering, 1,170 in direct production and the balance in sales and marketing, administration, finance and support services. Our production staff includes highly skilled optical craftsmen. We have a long-standing policy of encouraging active employee participation in areas of operations management. We believe our relations with our employees to be good. We reward our employees with incentive compensation based on achievement of performance goals. Trade Secrets, Patents and Trademarks We rely on our trade secrets, proprietary know-how, invention disclosures and patents to develop and maintain our competitive position. We have begun to aggressively pursue process and product patents in certain areas of our businesses. We have confidentiality and noncompetition agreements with certain personnel. We require all United States employees sign a confidentiality and noncompetition agreement upon commencement of employment. The processes and specialized equipment utilized in crystal growth, infrared materials fabrication and infrared optical coatings as developed by us are complex and difficult to duplicate. However, there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or that all aspects of our proprietary technology will be protected. Others have obtained patents covering a variety of infrared optical configurations and processes, and others could obtain patents covering technology similar to our technology. We may be required to obtain licenses under such patents, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such licenses, if required, on commercially reasonable terms, or that claims regarding rights to technology will not be asserted which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our research and development contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government present a risk that project-specific technology could be disclosed to competitors as contract reporting requirements are fulfilled. We currently hold eight registered trademarks: II-VI INCORPORATED() name; INFRAREADY OPTICS() for replacement optics for industrial CO2 lasers; EPIREADY() for low surface damage substrates for Mercury Cadmium Telluride epitaxy; eV PRODUCTS() for products manufactured by our eV PRODUCTS division; 11 LASER POWER CORPORATION() name; MP-5() for low absorption coating technology; the MARLOW INDUSTRIES, INC.() name; and the MARLOW INDUSTRIES, INC.trademark. The trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office but not with any states. We are not aware of any interference or opposition to these trademarks in any jurisdiction. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The Company cautions investors that its performance (and, therefore, any forward-looking statement) is subject to risks and uncertainties. Various important factors including, but not limited to, the following may cause the Companys future results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. We Depend on Highly Complex Manufacturing Processes Which Require Products from Limited Sources of Supply We utilize high quality, optical grade ZnSe in the production of many of our infrared optical products. We are the leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring production in a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality ZnSe. ZnSe is available from only one outside source where quantity and qualities may be limited. The unavailability of necessary amounts of high quality ZnSe would have a material adverse effect upon us. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We produce Hydrogen Selenide gas which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our inability to effectively handle Hydrogen Selenide could require us to curtail our production of Hydrogen Selenide. Hydrogen Selenide is available from only one outside source where quantities and qualities may be limited. The cost of purchasing such material is greater than the cost of internal production. As a result, purchasing a substantial portion of such material from the outside source would increase our production costs of ZnSe. Therefore, our inability to internally produce Hydrogen Selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we produce and utilize other high purity, relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products. Failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. International Sales Account for a Significant Portion of Our Revenues Sales to customers in countries other than the United States accounted for approximately 41%, 40% and 41% of revenues during the years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. In addition, we manufacture products in Singapore, China and Vietnam and maintain direct sales offices in Germany, Japan, Switzerland, the UK and Belgium. Sales and operations outside of the United States are subject to certain inherent risks, including fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, political and economic instability, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. There can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In particular, currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business in the local currency could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition by rendering us less price-competitive than foreign manufacturers. Our sales in Japan are denominated in Yen and, accordingly, are affected by fluctuations in the dollar/yen currency exchange rates. We generally reduce our exposure to such fluctuations of the Yen through forward exchange agreements which target to hedge approximately 75% of our sales in Japan. We do not engage in the speculative trading of financial derivatives. There can be no assurance, however, that our practices will reduce or eliminate the risk of fluctuation of the Yen in the U.S. dollar/Japanese Yen currency exchange rate. 12 We May Encounter Substantial Competition We may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing or other capabilities more extensive than ours and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors, and competition may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. There Are Limitations on the Protection of Our Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyright and trademark laws combined with employee non-competition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that, in the future, third parties will not assert infringement claims against us. Asserting our rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense, thus materially and adversely affecting our business, results of operations or financial condition. In the event a third party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we may have to pay substantial damages or royalties, or expend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that it no longer infringes such proprietary rights, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our Success Depends on the Ability to Retain Key Personnel We are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Failure to Keep Pace with Industry Developments May Adversely Affect Our Operations We are engaged in industries which will be affected by future developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new developments could render existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our continued success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, processes and applications that keep pace with developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes, or that our products, applications or processes will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or if we did not gain market acceptance for the same. Our Success Depends on New Products and Processes In order to meet our strategic objectives, we must continue to develop, manufacture and market new products, develop new processes and improve existing processes. As a result, we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to continue to consider from time to time the strategic acquisition of businesses, products, or technologies complementary to our business. Our success in developing, introducing and selling new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors including product selection, timely and efficient completion of product design and development, timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing, and product performance in the field. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business. 13 We May Expand Product Lines and Markets by Acquiring Other Businesses Our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through internal product development and acquisitions. Any acquisition may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, acquired businesses may be experiencing operating losses. Any acquisition will involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired companys operations and products, uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new customers, and the potential loss of the acquired companys key personnel. The following information relates to significant acquisitions made since fiscal year ended June 30, 1995. Acquired Party Year Acquired Business Segment Percentage Ownershipas of June 30, 2006 Virgo Optics Division of Sandoz Chemicals Corporation Fiscal 1995 Near-Infrared Optics 100 % Lightning Optical Corporation Fiscal 1996 Near-Infrared Optics 100 % Laser Power Corporation Fiscal 2001 Military Infrared Optics and Infrared Optics 100 % Silicon Carbide Group of Litton Systems, Inc. Fiscal 2002 Compound Semiconductor Group 100 % 5NPlus, Inc. Fiscal 2002 Compound Semiconductor Group 36 % II-VI Deutschland GmbH Fiscal 2003 Infrared Optics and Near-Infrared Optics 100 % II-VI LOT Suisse S.a.r.l. Fiscal 2004 Infrared Optics 75 % Ultra-Violet Filter Product Line of Coherent, Inc. Fiscal 2004 Near-Infrared Optics 100 % Marlow Industries, Inc. Fiscal 2005 Compound Semiconductor Group 100 % Our Revenues May Suffer if General Economic Conditions Worsen Our revenues and earnings may be affected by general economic factors, such as inflation, currency fluctuations and employment levels, resulting in a temporary or longer-term overall decline in demand for our products. Therefore, any significant downturn or recession in the United States or other countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. A Significant Portion of Our Business is Dependent on Other Cyclical Industries Our business is significantly dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers. Many of these end-users are in industries that historically have experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products are subject to cyclical fluctuations. This cyclical demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our Revenues are Subject to Potential Seasonal Fluctuations Due to our customers buying patterns, particularly in Europe, revenues for our first fiscal quarter ending in September could be below those in the preceding quarter. Our first fiscal quarter results often are dependent upon the sales made in the last month of the quarter. Exposure to Government Markets With the acquisition of Marlow and the operations of our Military and Near-Infrared Optics businesses, sales to customers in the defense industry have increased. These customers in turn generally contract with a governmental entity, typically the U.S. government. Most governmental programs are subject to funding approval and can be modified or terminated with no warning upon the determination of a legislative or administrative body. The loss or failure to obtain certain contracts or a loss of a major government customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 14 Our Stock Price May Fluctuate Future announcements concerning us, our competitors or customers, quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of technological innovations, the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors, seasonal or other variations in anticipated or actual results of operations, changes in earnings estimates by analysts or reports regarding our industries in the financial press or investment advisory publications, among other factors, could cause the market price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, stock prices may fluctuate widely for reasons which may be unrelated to operating results. These fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, military conflicts or market or market-sector declines, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, any information concerning us, including projections of future operating results, appearing in investment advisory publications or on-line bulletin boards or otherwise emanating from a source other than us could in the future contribute to volatility in the market price of our common stock. Provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws May Limit the Price that Investors May be Willing to Pay in the Future for Shares of Our Common Stock Our articles of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions which could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover or make it more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer or a proxy contest. The provisions include: classification of the board of directors into three classes; a procedure which requires shareholders or the board of directors to nominate directors in advance of a meeting to elect such directors; the ability of the board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class). In addition, the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law contains provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control. All of these may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. We Are Subject to Stringent Environmental Regulation We use or generate certain hazardous substances in our research and manufacturing facilities. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable local, state and federal environmental, safety and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper protective equipment, process controls and specialized training to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities and the environment due to the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. We regularly conduct employee physical examinations and workplace monitoring regarding such substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been indicated, corrective actions have been implemented and re-occurrence has been minimal or non-existent. We do not carry environmental impairment insurance. Relative to its generation and use of the hazardous substance Hydrogen Selenide, we have in place an emergency response plan. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to this gaseous material to minimize the chances of its accidental release to the atmosphere. With respect to the use, storage and disposal of the low-level radioactive material Thorium Fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah. The generation, use, collection, storage and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business are in place. Although we do not know of any material environmental, safety or health problems in our properties or processes, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 15 Some Laser Systems Are Complex in Design and May Contain Defects that Are Not Detected Until Deployed Which Could Increase Our Costs and Reduce Our Revenues Laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance. The manufacture of lasers, laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process. As a result of the technical complexity of our products, changes in our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or in the use of defective or contaminated materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability. To the extent that we do not achieve such yields or product reliability, our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships could be adversely affected. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things: loss of customers; increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses; damage to our brand reputation; failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance; diversion of development and engineering resources; and legal action by our customers. The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections  a Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error. This statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, including issues relating to financial statement recognition and measurement. FIN 48 provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is more-likely-than-not of being sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. If an uncertain tax position meets the more-likely-than-not threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being recognized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority, is recorded. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on our financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 16
