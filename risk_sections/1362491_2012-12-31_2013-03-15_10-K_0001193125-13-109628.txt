Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the following are some of the potential risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as other information contained in this document, when evaluating your investments in our securities. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Risks Related to Our Potential Acquisition by Reliance The announcement and pendency of our acquisition by Reliance could adversely affect our business, financial results and operations. The announcement and pendency of the proposed acquisition could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. In particular, we could lose important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the proposed acquisition. We could potentially lose customers or suppliers, or contracts could be delayed or decreased. In addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources in an effort to complete the acquisition, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We are also subject to restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the Merger, including restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses, amend our organizational documents, and incur indebtedness. These restrictions could result in our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities and may otherwise harm our business, financial results and operations. The failure by Reliance to complete its acquisition of us could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock and could result in substantial termination costs. There is no assurance that completion of the acquisition by Reliance or any other transaction will occur. Consummation of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger by the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock, and certain other customary conditions, including the absence of laws or judgments prohibiting or restraining the Merger. Failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We will have incurred significant costs, including the diversion of management resources, for which we will have received little or no benefit. The Merger Agreement contains certain other termination rights for both us and Reliance, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, we may be obligated to pay Reliance a termination fee. A failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price. Risks Related to Business and Financial Structure The following discussion of risks are qualified in their entirety by impact that the potential acquisition by Reliance may have on our existing business and financial structure. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are heavily affected by changing metal prices. Metal costs typically represent approximately 75% of our net sales. Metal costs can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, production levels, competition, import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials for us and may, therefore, adversely affect our net sales, operating margin and net income. Our metal service centers maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead-times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, using information derived from customers, market conditions, historic usage and industry research, we purchase metal in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers. Our commitments for metal purchases are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. We have no substantial long-term, fixed-price purchase contracts. When raw material prices rise, we may not be able to pass the price increase on to our customers. When raw material prices decline, customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and, to the extent we reduce existing inventory quantities, lower margins. There have been historical periods of rapid and significant movements in the prices of metal both upward and downward. These changes can make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our results, which could cause us to have higher or lower levels of inventory than required or make expenditures that may not generate expected returns. Any limitation on our ability to pass through any price increases to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 15 Table of Contents Changes in metal prices also affect our liquidity because of the time difference between our payment for our raw materials and our collection of cash from our customers. We sell our products and typically collect our accounts receivable within 45 days after the sale; however, we tend to pay for replacement materials (which are more expensive when metal prices are rising) over a much shorter period, in part to benefit from early-payment discounts. As a result, when metal prices are rising, we tend to draw more on our $500 million amended and restated senior secured asset-based credit facility due 2016 (the ABL facility) to cover the cash flow cycle from our raw material purchases to cash collection. This cash requirement for working capital is higher in periods when we are increasing inventory quantities. Our liquidity is thus adversely affected by rising metal prices. For more information, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOperating and Investing Activities. Our operating results and liquidity could be negatively affected during economic downturns because the demand for our products is cyclical. Many of our products are used in businesses that are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns due to economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and other factors beyond our control. These economic and industry downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, excess capacity and, in some cases, lower average selling prices for our products. Economic downturns and uncertainty about current global economic conditions pose risks as businesses in one or more of the markets that we serve, or consumers in one or more of the end-use markets that our customers serve, may postpone purchases in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in asset values, which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and services and on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, as an increasing amount of our customers relocate their manufacturing facilities outside of the United States, we may not be able to maintain our level of sales to those customers. The decline in steel prices resulting from weakened demand and an oversupply of steel throughout the supply chain during the latter half of 2008 and first half of 2009 contributed to a significant decline in steel product shipments from metals service centers in the United States. Reduced demand in a number of our markets combined with the foreign relocation of some of our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our customers sell their products abroad, and some of our suppliers buy feedstock abroad. As a result, our business is affected by general economic conditions and other factors outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia. Our suppliers access to metal, and therefore our access to metal, is additionally affected by such conditions and factors. Similarly, the demand for our customers products, and therefore our products, is affected by such conditions and factors. These conditions and factors include enhanced imbalances in the worlds iron ore, coal and steel industries, a downturn in world economies, increases in interest rates, unfavorable currency fluctuations or a slowdown in the key industries served by our customers. In addition, demand for the products of our Building Products Group has been adversely affected by the downturn in the U.S. housing market, since the results of that group depend on a strong residential remodeling industry, which in turn has been historically driven by an expansion in the broader housing market and relatively high consumer confidence. We rely on metal suppliers in our business and purchase a significant amount of metal from a limited number of suppliers and termination of one or more of our relationships with any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We use a variety of metals in our business. Our operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of metal on a timely basis. We purchase most of our metal from a limited number of metal suppliers. As of December 31, 2012, our top four metals suppliers represented a significant portion of our total metal purchasing cost. Termination of our relationship with any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows if we were unable to obtain metal from other sources in a timely manner. In addition, the domestic metals production industry has experienced consolidation in recent years. Further consolidation could result in a decrease in the number of our major suppliers or a decrease in the number of alternative supply sources available to us, which could make it more likely that termination of one or more of our relationships with major suppliers would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Consolidation could also result in price increases for the metal that we purchase. Such price increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows if we were not able to pass these price increases on to our customers. Intense competition in our fragmented industry could adversely affect our profitability. We are engaged in a highly fragmented and competitive industry. We compete with a large number of other value-added oriented metal processors/metal service centers on a regional and local basis, some of which may have greater financial resources than we have. Service centers compete with each other on price, service, quality and availability of products. According to Metal Center 16 Table of Contents News, Metals USA is ranked number eight among service centers in North America based on 2011 revenues. We also compete, to a much lesser extent, with primary metals producers, who typically sell to very large customers requiring regular shipments of large volumes of metals. Because price, particularly in the ferrous flat rolled business, is a competitive factor, we may be required in the future to reduce sales volumes to maintain our level of profitability. Increased competition in any of our businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our ability to retain our key employees is critical to the success of our business, and failure to do so may adversely affect our revenues and as a result could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are dependent on the services of certain members of our senior management team to remain competitive in our industry. We may not be able to retain or replace one or more of these key employees, we may suffer an extended interruption in one or more of their services or we may lose the services of one or more of these key employees entirely. Our current key employees are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that permit the employees to terminate their employment without notice. We do not maintain any life insurance policies for our key employees. If any of our key employees were not able to dedicate adequate time to our business, due to personal or other factors, if we lose or suffer an extended interruption in the services of any of our key employees or if any of our key employees were to terminate their employment it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the market for qualified individuals may be highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management or other key employees, should the need arise. From time to time, there are shortages of qualified operators of metals processing equipment. In addition, during periods of low unemployment, turnover among less-skilled workers can be relatively high. Any failure to retain a sufficient number of such employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We are subject to litigation that could strain our resources and distract management. From time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. These suits concern issues including product liability, contract disputes, employee-related matters and personal injury matters. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims, and the ultimate resolution of these matters as well as future lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or reputation. Environmental costs could decrease our net cash flow and adversely affect our profitability. Our operations are subject to extensive regulations governing waste disposal, air and water emissions, the handling of hazardous substances, remediation, workplace exposure and other environmental matters. Some of the properties we own or lease are located in areas with a history of heavy industrial use, and are near sites listed for clean up under CERCLA. CERCLA established joint and several responsibility for clean-up without regard to fault for persons who have arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at sites that have become contaminated and for persons who own or operate contaminated facilities. We have a number of properties located in or near industrial or light industrial use areas; accordingly, these properties may have been contaminated by pollutants which would have migrated from neighboring facilities or have been deposited by prior occupants. Some of our properties are affected by contamination from leaks and drips of cutting oils and similar materials. The costs of clean-ups to date have not been material. It is possible that we could be notified of such claims in the future. It is also possible that we could be identified by the Environmental Protection Agency, a state agency or one or more third parties as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or under analogous state laws. If so, we could incur substantial costs related to such claims, which could decrease our net cash flows and adversely affect our profitability. For more information, see BusinessGovernment Regulation and Environmental Matters. Adverse developments in our relationship with our unionized employees could adversely affect our business. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 180 of our employees (approximately 7%) at various sites were members of unions. We are currently a party to seven collective-bargaining agreements. Six expire in 2013 and one expires in 2014. Presently we do not anticipate any problems or issues with respect to renewing these agreements upon acceptable terms. However, no assurances can be given that we will succeed in negotiating new collective-bargaining agreements to replace the expiring ones without a strike. Any strikes in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See BusinessEmployees for a discussion of our previous negotiations of collective-bargaining agreements. Our ability to pursue our historical acquisition strategy is restricted by the terms of the Merger Agreement with Reliance. To the extent we continue to pursue our acquisition strategy, we may not successfully implement our strategy, and acquisitions that we pursue may present unforeseen integration obstacles and costs, increase our leverage and negatively impact our performance. The Merger Agreement with Reliance contains operating covenants that restrict our ability to engage in acquisitions. However, if the Merger with Reliance is not completed, we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions. Historically, we generally have targeted one to two bolt-on acquisitions per year to enhance our metal service center strategy. To the extent we continue to pursue acquisitions in the future, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, and if we do identify suitable candidates, they 17 Table of Contents may be larger than our historical targets. The expense incurred in consummating acquisitions of related businesses, or our failure to integrate such businesses successfully into our existing businesses, could affect our growth or result in our incurring unanticipated expenses and losses. Furthermore, we may not be able to realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions. To finance an acquisition, we may incur debt or issue equity, both of which could be materially greater amounts than in connection with prior acquisitions. The process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Some of the risks associated with our historical acquisition strategy which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, include:  potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;  unexpected loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company;  conforming the acquired companys standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;  coordinating new product and process development;  hiring additional management and other critical personnel;  encountering unknown contingent liabilities that could be material; and  increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. As a result of the foregoing, to the extent we pursue our historical acquisition strategy, our strategy may not be successfully received by customers, and we may not realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions. Metals USA Holdings is a holding company and relies on dividends and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from its subsidiaries to meet its dividend and other obligations. Metals USA Holdings has no direct operations and derives all of its cash flow from its subsidiaries. Because Metals USA Holdings conducts its operations through its subsidiaries, Metals USA Holdings depends on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations, and to pay any dividends with respect to our common stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in the ABL facility, the agreement governing Metals USAs Senior Secured Term Loan Due 2019 (the Term Loan) (the Term Loan Agreement) and other agreements governing current and future indebtedness of Metals USA Holdings subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of Metals USA Holdings subsidiaries, currently limit and may, in the future, limit Metals USA Holdings ability to obtain cash from its subsidiaries. The earnings from, or other available assets of, Metals USA Holdings subsidiaries may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable Metals USA Holdings to pay any dividends on our common stock. We may not be able to retain or expand our customer base if the North American manufacturing industry continues to erode through moving offshore or through acquisition and merger or consolidation activity in our customers industries. Our customer base, including our Flat Rolled and Non-Ferrous Groups customer base, primarily includes manufacturing and industrial firms. Some of these customers operate in industries that are undergoing consolidation through acquisition and merger activity; some are considering or have considered relocating production operations overseas or outsourcing particular functions overseas; and some customers have closed as they were unable to compete successfully with overseas competitors. Our facilities are predominately located in the mid-western and southern United States. To the extent that these customers cease U.S. operations, relocate or move operations overseas to regions in which we do not have a presence, we could lose their business. In addition, acquirers of manufacturing and industrial firms may have suppliers of choice that do not include us, which could affect our customer base and sales. We may face product liability claims that are costly and create adverse publicity. If any of the products that we sell cause harm to any of our customers, we could be exposed to product liability lawsuits. If we were found liable under product liability claims, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Further, even if we successfully defended ourselves against this type of claim, we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses, our management could be required to spend valuable time to defend against these claims and our reputation could suffer, any of which could harm our business. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. The Term Loan, the ABL facility and our other outstanding indebtedness accounted for significant cash interest expenses in fiscal 2012 and the same is expected in subsequent years. Accordingly, we will have to generate significant cash flows from operations to meet our debt service requirements. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, we may need to seek additional financing; however, this insufficient cash flow may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, Apollo has no obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing and we therefore may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness. 18 Table of Contents Our use of leverage exposes us to interest rate risk and could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2012, our total indebtedness was $451.6 million. We also had an additional $194.3 million available for borrowing under the ABL facility as of that date. Our indebtedness could have important consequences for you, including:  it may limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow money, dispose of assets or sell equity for our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt service requirements, strategic initiatives or other purposes;  it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;  we may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;  it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy; and  there would be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows if we were unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, as needed. Our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The ABL facility and the Term Loan Agreement contain various covenants that limit or prohibit our ability, among other things, to:  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;  pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase, retire or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness or make other restricted payments;  enter into or permit certain agreements or make certain investments or loans;  sell certain assets;  create or incur liens; and  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. Among other exceptions to these covenants, the Term Loan Agreement includes a $15.0 million annual dividend basket in order to permit the distribution of funds by Flag Intermediate and Metals USA to Metals USA Holdings for the payment of the Companys previously announced regular quarterly dividend on the Companys common stock, subject to declaration by the Companys Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2012, our fixed charge coverage ratio (FCCR), as defined by the loan and security agreement governing the ABL facility, was 2.44. As of December 31, 2012 we had $194.3 million of additional borrowing capacity under the ABL facility. Failure to comply with the FCCR covenant of the ABL facility can result in limiting our long-term growth prospects by hindering our ability to incur future indebtedness or grow through acquisitions. We do not have to maintain a minimum FCCR as long as our borrowing availability under the ABL facility is greater than or equal to the greater of (i) $45.0 million and (ii) 10% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the aggregate commitment (the Minimum Availability). We must maintain an FCCR of at least 1.0 to 1.0 if borrowing availability falls below the Minimum Availability. Our inability to satisfy the terms of the negative covenants in our debt agreements do not, by themselves, constitute covenant violations or events of default. Rather, they are event-related restrictions that limit or prohibit the Company from taking certain corporate actions. For more information, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCovenant Compliance. The restrictions contained in the agreements that govern the terms of our debt could:  limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans;  adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, to enter into strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest; and  limit our access to the cash generated by our subsidiaries. 19 Table of Contents Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the ABL facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the ABL facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the ABL facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the ABL facility on a first-priority lien basis. If the lenders under the ABL facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings, such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we may not have sufficient assets to repay the Term Loan upon acceleration. For a more detailed description on the limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFinancing Activities. Despite our current indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The terms of the Term Loan Agreement and the ABL facility contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Accordingly, we or our subsidiaries could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $194.3 million available for additional borrowing under the ABL facility, including the subfacility for letters of credit, and the covenants under our debt agreements would allow us to borrow a significant amount of additional indebtedness. Additional leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could increase the risks described in Our use of leverage exposes us to interest rate risk and could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness, Our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and Because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates, we are vulnerable to interest rate increases. Because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates, we are vulnerable to interest rate increases. Our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short-term prevailing interest rates. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $451.3 million of floating rate debt under the ABL facility, the Term Loan and our Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRBs). We also had an additional $194.3 million available for borrowing under the ABL facility as of December 31, 2012. Assuming a consistent level of debt, a 100 basis point change in the interest rate on our floating rate debt effective from the beginning of the year would increase or decrease our fiscal 2012 interest expense under the ABL facility and the IRBs by approximately $4.5 million. We use derivative financial instruments to manage a portion of the potential impact of our interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2012, we had $3.9 million of IRBs that were hedged under interest rate swap agreements. To some extent, derivative financial instruments can protect against increases in interest rates, but they do not provide complete protection over the longer term. If interest rates increase dramatically, we could be unable to service our debt which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We are presently controlled by Apollo and its affiliates, and their interests as equity holders may conflict with yours. We are an affiliate of, and are controlled by, Apollo and its affiliates. The interests of Apollo and its affiliates may not always be aligned with yours. For example, Apollo may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though these transactions might involve risks to the non-affiliated holders of our common stock or holders of our debt if the transactions resulted in our being more highly leveraged or significantly changed the nature of our business operations or strategy. In addition, if we encounter financial difficulties, or if we are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of Apollo might conflict with those of the non-affiliated holders of our common stock or the holders of our debt. In that situation, for example, the non-affiliated holders of our common stock or the holders of our debt might want us to raise additional equity to reduce our leverage and pay our debts, while Apollo might not want to increase their investment in us or have their ownership diluted and instead choose to take other actions, such as selling our assets. Furthermore, Apollo and its affiliates have no continuing obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing. Additionally, Apollo and certain of its affiliates are in the business of making investments in businesses engaged in the metals service industry that complement or directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. Further, if they pursue such acquisitions in the metals service industry, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as Apollo and its affiliates continue to indirectly own a significant amount of our equity, even if such amount is less than 50%, they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our business decisions.
