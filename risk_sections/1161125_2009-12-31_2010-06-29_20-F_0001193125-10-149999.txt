RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not know about or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of the following risks if they actually occur, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, prospects and financial condition. We are subject to market risks that are presented both in this subsection and in Note 45 to our audited consolidated financial statements. Risks Relating to our Operations and the Banking Industry The growth of our loan portfolio may expose us to increased loan losses. During the last five years, our total loan portfolio has experienced a significant increase, which has been primarily fueled by the increase shown by our commercial and mortgage loan portfolio, and, to a lesser extent, by the growth in our consumer loan portfolio. Expansion of our loan portfolio (especially those related to the retail market) may expose us to a higher level of loan losses and require us to establish higher levels of allowances for loan losses. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our total allowances for loan losses accounted for Ch$312,101 million, or 2.37% of our total loans, as compared to 1.64% in 2008. Our loan portfolio may not continue to grow at the same or similar rate. We cannot assure you that our loan portfolio will continue to grow at historical rates. The Chilean banking systems loan portfolio has shown a significant increase over the last five years, which has been prompted by the banking systems efforts to increase the offer of products to its customers, as well as by the good conditions experienced by the Chilean economy over the last decade. However, a slowdown or negative growth rate of the Chilean economy could adversely affect the growth rate of our loan portfolio and our credit quality indicators and, accordingly, increase our required allowances for loan losses.
