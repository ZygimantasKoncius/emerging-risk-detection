Risk Factors You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. You should read the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements beginning on page 1 for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Risks Related to Our Business If we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed, we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire. Our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers, including certain data, software and service suppliers. Our index and analytics products are dependent upon (and of little value without) updates from our data suppliers and most of our software products are dependent upon (and of little value without) continuing access to historical and current data. As of November 30, 2009, we utilized and distributed certain data provided to us by over 235 data sources, including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world. If the products of our suppliers have errors, are delayed, have design defects, are unavailable on acceptable terms or are not available at all, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers, such as certain stock exchanges. Many of these data suppliers compete with one another and, to some extent, with us. From time to time we receive notices from data suppliers, 16 Table of Contents including stock exchanges, threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us. Termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from, or restricted use of, or litigation in connection with, a data providers information could decrease the available information for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although data suppliers and stock exchanges typically benefit from broad access to their data, some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers, including with certain stock exchanges. If our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors a competitive advantage. Such exclusive contracts would hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer, which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Some data suppliers may seek to increase licensing fees for providing their content to us. If we are unable to renegotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these data suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent content, we may be required to reduce our profit margins or experience a reduction in our market share. Some of our third-party suppliers also are our competitors, increasing the risks noted above. Any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many of our products exchange information with clients through a variety of media, including the Internet, software applications and dedicated transmission lines. We rely on a complex network of internal process and software controls to protect the confidentiality of client data, such as client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in implementation of our internal controls, misappropriation of client data could occur. Such internal control inadequacies could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material, non-public information regarding changes to the composition of our indices. If our information barrier procedures fail, our reputation could be damaged and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We change the composition of our indices from time to time. We believe that, in some cases, the changes we make to our indices can affect the prices of constituent securities and products based on our indices. Our index clients rely on us to keep material non-public information about changes to the future composition of an index confidential and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients. We have implemented information barrier procedures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding material non-public changes to the composition of our indices. If our information barrier procedures fail and we inadvertently disclose or an individual deliberately misuses material non-public information about a change to one of our indices, our reputation may suffer. Clients loss of trust and confidence in our information barrier policies and procedures could lead to a negative reputation throughout the investment community, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, certain exchanges permit our clients to list exchange traded funds or other financial products based on our indices only if we provide a representation to the exchange that we have reasonable information barrier procedures in place to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material, non-public information about changes to the composition of our indices. If an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient, the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our indices, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 17 Table of Contents Legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages. Third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights, and pending third-party litigation may adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We consider certain aspects of our products and processes to be proprietary. We rely primarily on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark rights, as well as contractual protections and technical measures, to protect our products and processes. Despite our efforts, third parties may still try to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections. There is no guarantee that any trade secret, patent, copyright or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages, nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights. Even if we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation, it may require considerable cost, time and resources to do so, and there is no guarantee that we would be successful. Furthermore, our competitors may also independently develop, patent or otherwise protect products and processes that are the same or similar to ours. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Also, some elements of our products and processes may not be subject to intellectual property protection.  Trademarks and Service MarksWe have registered MSCI, Barra and FEA as trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries. We have also registered other product trademarks and certain service marks in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries. When we enter a new geographic market or introduce a new product brand, there can be no assurance that our existing trademark or service mark of choice will be available. Furthermore, the fact that we have registered trademarks is not an assurance that other companies may not use the same or similar names.  PatentsWe currently hold 11 U.S. and foreign utility patents and one design patent. We currently have 11 U.S. and foreign utility patent applications pending. Patent applications can be extremely costly to process and defend. There can be no assurance that we will be issued any patents that we apply for or that any of the rights granted under any patent that we obtain will be sufficient to protect our competitive advantages.  CopyrightsWe believe our proprietary software and proprietary data are copyright protected. If a court were to determine that any of our proprietary software or proprietary data, such as our index level data, is not copyright protected, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  Confidentiality and Trade SecretsOur license agreements limit our clients right to copy or disclose our proprietary software and data. It is possible, however, that a client might still make unauthorized copies of our proprietary software or data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, if a client who licensed a large volume of our proprietary historical data made that information publicly available, we might lose potential clients who could freely obtain a copy of the data. We also seek to protect our proprietary software and data through trade secret protection and through non-disclosure agreements with our employees. However, if an employee breaches his or her non-disclosure agreement and reveals a trade secret, we could lose the trade secret protection, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, it may be very difficult to ascertain if a former employee is inappropriately using or disclosing our proprietary information. Additionally, the enforceability of our license and non-disclosure agreements and the remedies available to us in the event of a breach vary due to the many different jurisdictions in which our clients and employees are located.  License AgreementsOur products are generally made available to end users on a periodic subscription basis under a nontransferable license agreement signed by the client. We also permit access to some data, such as certain index information, through the Internet under on-line licenses that are affirmatively acknowledged by the licensee or under terms of use. The enforceability of on-line licenses and terms of use has not been conclusively determined by the courts. There can be no assurance that third parties will abide by the terms of our licenses or that all of our license agreements will be enforceable. 18 Table of Contents  Pending Third-Party LitigationThere is currently litigation pending in the U.S. regarding whether issuers of index-linked investment products are required to obtain a license from the index owner or whether companies may issue and trade investment products based on a publicly-available index without the need for permission from (or payment to) the index owner. We are not a party to these suits, but they may have a material impact on our business. In a relevant case in 2006, a federal appeals court ruled against Dow Jones & Company, Inc. (Dow Jones) and The McGraw-Hill Companies (McGraw-Hill) in their attempt to prevent International Securities Exchange, Inc. from offering options on ETFs based on Dow Jones and McGraw-Hills indices. In another relevant case, in 2009, the German Federal Supreme Court concluded that the owner of a trademark who publishes an index generally available to all market participants cannot prohibit, on the basis of German trademark law, a third party from referring to the index as a reference value in option warrants issued by the third party if the trademark is used for informational and factual purposes and does not imply that a relationship exists with the trademark owner. If other courts in relevant jurisdictions further determine that a license is not required to issue investment products linked to indices, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It might also lead to changes in current industry practices such that we would no longer make our index level data publicly available, such as via our website or news media. Third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights. Third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights. Businesses operating in the financial services sector, including our competitors and potential competitors, have in recent years increasingly pursued patent protection for their technologies and business methods. If any third parties were to obtain a patent on a relevant index methodology, risk model or software application, we could be sued for infringement. Furthermore, there is always a risk that third parties will sue us for infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, copyrights or trade secrets. From time to time we receive such notices from others alleging intellectual property infringement or potential infringement. The number of these claims may grow. We have made and expect to continue making expenditures related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk. Responding to intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, can consume valuable time, result in costly litigation or cause delays. We may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms, and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled. We may be required to pay damages, required to stop selling or using the affected products or applications or required to enter into royalty and licensing agreements. There can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made, if at all, on terms that are commercially acceptable to us. We may also be called upon to defend partners, clients, suppliers or distributors against such third-party claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts. Therefore, the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our use of open source code could impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products, or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential. We rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products, as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure. We monitor our use of open source code to attempt to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend. The terms of many open source code licenses, however, are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by U.S. courts. Accordingly, there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In either event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to make generally available (in source code form) proprietary code that links to certain open source 19 Table of Contents code modules, to re-engineer our products or systems or to discontinue the licensing of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis. Any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are dependent on the use of third-party software and data, and any reduction in third-party product quality or any failure by us to comply with our licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We rely on third-party software and data in connection with our product development and offerings. We depend on the ability of third-party software and data providers to deliver and support reliable products, enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. The third-party software and data we use may become obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products. We also monitor our use of third-party software and data to comply with applicable license requirements. Despite our efforts, there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use, resulting in our loss of rights or costly legal actions. Our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by software or data that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason. In addition, our operating costs could increase if license fees for third-party software or data increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to third-party or other software or data are substantial. Some of these third-party suppliers are also our competitors, increasing the risks noted above. If our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Products we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing. Such errors can exist at any point in a products life cycle, but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products. We continually introduce new products and new versions of our products. Despite internal testing and testing by current and potential clients, our current and future products may contain serious defects or malfunctions. If we detect any errors before we release a product, we might have to delay the product release for an extended period of time while we address the problem. We might not discover errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed, and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors. Errors may occur in our products that could have a material adverse effect on our business and could result in harm to our reputation, lost sales, delays in commercial release, third-party claims, contractual disputes, negative publicity, delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products, license terminations or renegotiations, or unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors. Furthermore, our clients may use our products together with their own software, data or products from other companies. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Even when our products do not cause these problems, the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts, impact our reputation, cause significant client relations problems or result in legal claims against us. The realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business is dependent on the financial viability of our clients. If our clients are negatively impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets and are forced to shut-down or consolidate, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Most of our clients are in the financial services industry. For example, asset managers accounted for 66.6% and 67.6% of our revenues as of November 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The recent global financial crisis led to the closure or consolidation of a number of our clients, including asset manager, broker-dealer and hedge fund clients. Such events impacted our financial results, including our run rates and Aggregate and Core Retention Rates, in 2009 and may continue to do so in the near term. 20 Table of Contents Furthermore, if such trends continue, we may not be able to generate future growth and demand for our products may decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our clients do not remain financially viable or if the negative conditions in the financial markets persist or worsen, we may be forced to increase our provisions for bad debts, which could adversely affect our profitability. Our business is dependent on our clients continued investment in equity securities. If our clients significantly reduce their investments in equity securities, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The majority of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring equity portfolios. To the extent our clients investment emphasis significantly changes from equity to fixed income securities or multi-asset class or derivative strategies, the demand for equity products would likely decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our revenues and earnings are affected by changes in the capital markets, particularly the equity capital markets. Clients that use our indices as the basis for certain index-linked investment products, such as exchange traded funds and mutual funds, commonly pay us a fee based on the investment products assets. These asset-based fees make up a significant portion of our revenues. They were 16.3%, 16.9% and 18.6% of revenues for the years ended November 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These asset-based fees accounted for 43.9%, 48.0% and 51.5% of the revenues from our ten largest clients in the fiscal years ended November 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Economic uncertainty and volatile capital markets, such as those witnessed in 2009 and the second half of 2008 as well as changing investment styles, may influence an investors decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an index-linked investment product. For example, as of November 30, 2009, the month-end value of assets in ETFs linked to MSCI equity indices was $234.2 billion, which was 96.8% higher than the value of such assets as of November 30, 2008, but the value of such assets at November 30, 2008 was 37.9% lower than the value of such assets as of November 30, 2007. The increase compared to November 30, 2008 was comprised of net asset appreciation of $66.7 billion and $48.5 billion in net asset inflows. Continuing economic uncertainty could result in the fluctuation of or declines in our asset-based fees, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Consolidation within our target markets may affect our business. Consolidation in the financial services industry could reduce our existing client base and the number of potential clients. For example, the recent global financial crisis led to the closure or merger of a number of our clients, including broker-dealer, asset manager and hedge fund clients. If consolidation continues, it may negatively impact our ability to generate future growth and may reduce demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business is dependent on our clients continuing to measure the performance of their equity investments against equity benchmarks. If our clients discontinue use of equity benchmarks to measure performance, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our equity index products serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments. If clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark, the demand for our indices could decrease. Any such decrease in demand for our equity index products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 21 Table of Contents Our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower asset-based fee percentage or may cease using our indices, which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from asset-based fees. A portion of our revenues are from asset-based fees and these revenues are concentrated in some of our largest clients. Our clients may seek to negotiate a lower asset-based fee percentage for a variety of reasons. As the assets of index-linked investment products managed by our clients change, they may request to pay us lower asset-based fee percentages. Additionally, as competition among our clients increases, they may have to lower the fees they charge to their clients, which could cause them to try to decrease our fees accordingly. For example, competition is intense and increasing among our clients that provide exchange traded funds. The fees they charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for these exchange traded fund managers. Additionally, clients that have licensed our indices to serve as the basis of index-linked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indices and could elect to cease offering the product or could change the index to a non-MSCI index, in which case our asset-based fees could dramatically decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients changing needs, market changes and technological developments. The market for our products is characterized by shifting client demands, evolving market practices and, for some of our products, rapid technological change. Changed client demands, new market practices or new technologies can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable. As a result, our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products and product enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and respond to technological and market changes. We may not be successful in developing, introducing, marketing and licensing our new products or product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis, or at all, and our new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. In addition, clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements. A limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue. Cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For the fiscal years ended November 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 27.3%, 28.6% and 30.8% of our total revenues, respectively. If we fail to obtain a significant number of new clients or if one of our largest clients cancels its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses, our business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected. For the fiscal years ended November 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our largest client organization by revenue, Barclays PLC and affiliates, accounted for 9.9%, 11.0% and 12.6% of our total revenues, respectively. For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2009, approximately 87.5% of the revenue from Barclays came from fees based on the assets in Barclays exchange traded funds based on MSCI indices. In December 2009, BlackRock, Inc. and Barclays PLC announced the completion of the merger between BlackRock, Inc. and Barclays Global Investors, which includes the iShares exchange traded funds business. If we combined our revenues from BlackRock, Inc. with our revenues from the fees attributable to the businesses acquired by BlackRock, Inc., BlackRock Inc. would have represented 10.6% of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2009. Cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses or renegotiation of terms by a significant number of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our primary commercial model is to license annual, recurring subscriptions to our products for use at a specified location and by a given number of users. For most of our products, our clients may cancel their 22 Table of Contents subscriptions or investment product licenses at the end of the current term. While we believe this practice supports our marketing efforts by allowing clients to subscribe without the requirement of a long-term commitment, the cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by a significant number of clients at any given time may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our clients may become more self-sufficient, which may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our clients may develop independently certain functionality contained in the products they currently license from us. For example, some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk, making our products unnecessary for them. To the extent that our clients become more self-sufficient, demand for our products may be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Increased competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We face competition across all markets for our products. Our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small, single-product businesses that are highly specialized. Our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale, and our competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical, marketing and financial resources to compete with us. In addition, barriers to entry to create a single-purpose product may be low in many cases. The Internet as a distribution channel has allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources, which has reduced barriers to entry even further. Low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors; for example, broker-dealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or equity indices. These competitive pressures may also result in fewer clients, fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses, price reductions, and increased operating costs, such as for marketing, resulting in lower revenue, gross margins and operating income. Increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In recent years, more free or relatively inexpensive information has become available, particularly through the Internet, and this trend may continue. The availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products. Weak economic conditions also can result in clients seeking to utilize lower-cost information that is available from alternative sources. To the extent that our clients choose to use these sources for their information needs, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have experienced significant growth over our operating history. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past. Among other things, there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our marketing efforts as we have been in the past, or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past. See We must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients changing needs, market changes and technological developments above, We are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise below, Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 1.Business. Any failure to continue to grow our business and maintain profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 23 Table of Contents Our growth may place significant strain on our management and other resources. We must plan and manage our growth effectively to increase revenue and maintain profitability. Our growth, including in emerging market centers, has placed, and is expected to continue to place, significant demands on our personnel, management and other resources. We must continue to improve our operational, financial, management, legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the growth of our business. There can also be no assurance that, if we continue to grow internally or by way of acquisitions, management will be effective in attracting, training and retaining additional qualified personnel, including additional managers, expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure, integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing growth. Any failure to effectively manage growth or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See We must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients changing needs, market changes and technological developments above, We are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise below, Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 1Business. There is considerable risk embedded in growth through acquisitions, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. A principal element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions. Any future acquisitions could present a number of risks, including:  incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets;  failure to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and on a timely and cost effective basis;  failure to achieve assumed synergies;  insufficient knowledge of the operations and markets of acquired businesses;  increased debt, which may be incurred under terms less favorable than those associated with our current debt and may, among other things, reduce our free cash flow and increase our risk of default;  dilution of your common stock;  loss of key personnel;  diversion of managements attention from existing operations or other priorities; and  inability to secure, on terms we find acceptable, sufficient financing that may be required for any such acquisition or investment. In the event that we experience a high level of acquisition related activity within a limited period of time the possibility of occurrence of these risks would likely increase for that period. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses, operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our future growth, business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk. We are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk. Exchange rate movements can impact the U.S. dollar reported value of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded. 24 Table of Contents A significant percentage of our revenues from our index linked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For all operations outside the United States where the Company has designated the local non-U.S. dollar currency as the functional currency, revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates. For these operations, currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the U.S. dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders equity. In addition, transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in other non-operating expense (income). Revenues from index-linked investment products represented approximately 16.3% and 16.9% of operating revenues for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. While our fees for index-linked investment products are generally invoiced in U.S. dollars, the fees are based on the investment products assets, a significant percentage of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, declines in such other currencies against the U.S. dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses. In addition, declines in such currencies against the U.S. dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows, which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses. We generally invoice our clients in U.S. dollars; however, we invoice a portion of our clients in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and a limited number of other non-U.S. dollar currencies. For the fiscal years ended November 30, 2009 and 2008, approximately 12.3% and 14.1%, respectively, of our operating revenues were invoiced in currencies other than U.S. dollars. For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2009, 46.2% of our foreign currency revenues were in Euros, 39.4% were in Japanese Yen and 12.6% were in British Pounds. For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2008, 46.3% of our foreign currency revenues were in Euros, 30.2% were in Japanese Yen and 20.5% were in British Pounds. We are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs. Approximately 35.0% and 27.5% of our operating expenses for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were denominated in foreign currencies, the significant majority of which were denominated in Swiss Francs, British Pounds, Hong Kong Dollars, Euros, Japanese Yen, Indian Rupee and Hungarian Forint. Expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the U.S. We have certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency, a loss resulted from the devaluation of the value of the functional currency. As a result of these positions, we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of $0.4 million for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2009. These losses on foreign currency exchange were primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We do not currently hedge the foreign exchange risk of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. To the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels, as well as by foreign governments. It is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients businesses. If we fail to comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations, we could be subject to fines or other penalties. There can be no assurance that changes in laws, rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  Investment Advisers ActWe believe that our products do not provide investment advice for purposes of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Future developments in our product line or changes to the 25 Table of Contents current laws, rules or regulations could cause this status to change. It is possible we may become registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act or similar laws in states or foreign jurisdictions. As a registered investment adviser, we would be subject to the requirements and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act, which relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on agency and principal transactions between an adviser and advisory clients, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions. We may also be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC, other U.S. or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets around the world. In addition, we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become law. Compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business.  Data Privacy LegislationChanges in laws, rules or regulations, or consumer environments relating to consumer privacy or information collection and use may affect our ability to collect and use data. There could be a material adverse impact on our direct marketing, data sales and business due to the enactment of legislation or industry regulations, or simply a change in customs, arising from public concern over consumer privacy issues. Restrictions could be placed upon the collection, management, aggregation and use of information that is currently legally available, in which case our cost of collecting some kinds of data could materially increase. It is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs.  Soft DollarsApproximately 8%, 12% and 13% of our revenues were paid through soft dollar arrangements for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. U.S. clients accounted for 73%, 62% and 68% of total soft dollar revenues for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. On July 18, 2006, the SEC issued Interpretive Release No. 34-54165, which became effective on July 24, 2006. The release provides guidance on asset managers use of client commissions to pay for brokerage and research services within the scope of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). The Interpretive Release outlines a framework for determining what types of research services fall within the safe harbor provisions of that section. Market participants had a six-month grace period that ended on January 24, 2007 to bring their soft dollar practices into compliance with the new guidance. We rely on our clients to determine whether our products fall within the description of eligible research services, whether our products provide lawful and appropriate assistance to the money manager in undertaking investment decisions, and whether the commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the products provided for their particular business in the U.S. and abroad. If clients decide they cannot or will not pay for our products through soft dollar arrangements, or if additional rules are issued or certain interpretations are followed that narrow the definition of research or brokerage services that can be paid for on behalf of a money manager through use of soft dollars in the U.S. or abroad or the safe harbor provisions of Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act are eliminated, our revenues could decrease. We may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients. Our products support the investment processes of our clients, which, in the aggregate, manage trillions of dollars of assets. Our client agreements have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products. However, these provisions have certain exceptions and could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal, state, foreign or local laws. Use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts. Any such claim, even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us, would involve a significant commitment of our 26 Table of Contents management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation. In addition, such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. On November 14, 2007, we entered into the $500.0 million Credit Facility. See Item 1.BusinessThe Separation of MSCI from Morgan StanleyCredit Facility and Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources. As of November 30, 2009, we had $380.5 million of indebtedness under the Credit Facility ($338.2 million in long term debt and $42.3 million in current maturities), cash and cash equivalents of $176.0 million and $295.3 million in short-term investments. The Credit Facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and secured by a valid and perfected first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of the shares of the capital stock of our present and future domestic subsidiaries and up to 65% of the shares of capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries, substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries present and future property and assets and the proceeds thereof. In addition, the Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing future subsidiaries abilities to, among other things, incur liens; incur additional indebtedness; make or hold investments; make acquisitions, merge, dissolve, liquidate, consolidate with or into another person; sell, transfer or dispose of assets; pay dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock; change the nature of our business; enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arms length basis (except as described in Item 1.BusinessThe Separation of MSCI from Morgan Stanley); and prepay, redeem or repurchase debt. The Credit Facility also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis: (1) the maximum total leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis shall not exceed (a) 3.75:1.0 through November 30, 2009, (b) 3.50:1.0 from December 1, 2009 through November 30, 2010 and (c) 3.25:1.0 thereafter; and (2) the minimum interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis shall be (a) 3.00:1.0 through November 30, 2009, (b) 3.50:1.0 from December 1, 2009 through November 30, 2010 and (c) 4.00:1.0 thereafter. In addition, our Credit Facility contains the following affirmative covenants, among others: periodic delivery of financial statements, budgets and officers certificates; payment of other obligations; compliance with laws and regulations; payment of taxes and other material obligations; maintenance of property and insurance; performance of material leases; right of the lenders to inspect property, books and records; notices of defaults and other material events; and maintenance of books and records. In addition, we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. Our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general economic consequences; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow and proceeds of any additional equity issuances to payments of our indebtedness; make it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt; limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital and capital expenditures; limit our ability to consummate acquisitions; and increase our interest expense. 27 Table of Contents We are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The development, maintenance and support of our products is dependent upon the knowledge, experience and ability of our highly skilled, educated and trained employees. Accordingly, the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management, research, sales and marketing, information technology and other technical personnel. Although we do not believe that we are dependent upon any individual employee, the loss of a group of our key professional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, research, sales and marketing, information technology, software engineering and other technical personnel. Competition for such personnel worldwide is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. Additionally, in connection with our IPO, we issued founders grants to some of our employees and as these awards vest their effectiveness as a retention tool diminishes. If the equity incentive plans that we currently have in place do not adequately compensate our key employees or are not competitive, we may lose key personnel. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our products may suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems and the Internet, and any failures or disruptions may materially adversely affect our ability to serve our clients. We depend heavily on the capacity, reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems and the Internet. Heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties, operational failures, sabotage, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or hacking, human error, national disasters, power loss or computer viruses could cause our systems to operate slowly or interrupt their availability for periods of time. Our ability to effectively use the Internet may be impaired due to infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party Internet providers or increased government regulation. If disruptions, failures or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the Internet occur, our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients may be materially and adversely affected. Certain events could lead to interruptions in our operations, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operations depend on our ability to protect our equipment and the information stored in our databases against fires, floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters, as well as power losses, computer and telecommunications failures, technological breakdowns, unauthorized intrusions, terrorist attacks on sites where we or our clients are located, and other events. We also depend on accessible office facilities for our employees in order for our operations to function properly. There is no assurance that the business continuity plans that we have sufficiently cover or reduce the risk of interruption in our operations caused by these events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, immediately after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, our clients who were located in the World Trade Center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional products. In addition, delivery of some of the data we receive from New York-based suppliers was delayed. The grounding of air transportation impaired our ability to conduct sales visits and other meetings at client sites. During the resulting temporary closure of the U.S. stock markets, some of the data updates supporting our products were interrupted. These types of interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we currently estimate that the total cost of developing and implementing our business continuity plans will not have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these plans will be accurate. 28 Table of Contents We are subject to political, economic, legal, operational, franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations, which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways. As we continue to expand our international operations, we increase our exposure to political, economic, legal, operational, franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries, including risks of possible capital controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability. We have established and intend to further grow our presence in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America. In the last few years, we have opened offices in Budapest, Dubai, Monterrey, Mumbai and Shanghai. As of November 30, 2009, 43.1% of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 28.0% as of November 30, 2008. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industries are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally. We may incur unanticipated costs in connection with establishing and maintaining offices in emerging market locations. Our plans call for us to continue to increase the proportion of our employees in emerging market locations. The cost of establishing and maintaining these offices, including costs related to information technology infrastructure, as well as the costs of attracting, training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher, or may increase at a faster rate, than we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. As a global corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, such differences could have a material adverse effect on our statement of income for a particular future period. In addition, an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs. We are also subject to non-income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income tax liabilities. Risks Related to Our Separation from Morgan Stanley Our historical financial results for the periods before our separation from Morgan Stanley are derived from our results as a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley and include allocated costs for functions historically provided by Morgan Stanley and therefore may not be representative of our results as a stand-alone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results. Our historical financial information for the periods before our separation from Morgan Stanley do not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a stand-alone company during those periods and may not be indicative of the results we will achieve over time as a stand-alone public company. The historical costs and expenses reflected in our consolidated financial statements include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by Morgan Stanley, including portions 29 Table of Contents of human resources, information technology, accounting, legal and compliance, tax, office space leasing, corporate services and treasury. These allocations were based on what we and Morgan Stanley considered to be reasonable reflections of the historical utilization levels of these services required in support of our business. The historical information does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or costs and expenses will be over time. For additional information, see Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 6.Selected Consolidated Financial Data and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Since the completion of our IPO in November 2007, we have established our own financial, administrative and other support functions; including such functions that replace those services historically provided by Morgan Stanley and we cannot assure you that over time we will be able to operate our business as effectively or cost efficiently as Morgan Stanley. Prior to our separation from Morgan Stanley, we relied on certain financial, administrative and other resources of Morgan Stanley to operate our business both domestically and internationally. We completed our IPO in November 2007 and as a result of our IPO, we began enhancing certain financial, legal and compliance, administrative, information technology and other support systems and processes or contracting with third parties to replace Morgan Stanleys systems. In addition to replacing Morgan Stanley systems, we also created additional systems and processes. In May 2009, Morgan Stanley sold its remaining equity interest in us and we began operating as a stand-alone company. For the fiscal years ended November 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, expenses related to services provided by Morgan Stanley personnel were $1.7 million, $18.3 million and $26.4 million, respectively. As of May 22, 2009, Morgan Stanley no longer provided corporate functions for us and no additional expense allocations have been recorded by us since that date. The systems and processes we have created or obtained to replace those provided by Morgan Stanley have been established within the last few years and may not be sufficient to meet our needs. Any failure or significant downturn in our financial or administrative policies and systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. All of the procedures and practices required as a majority-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley were previously established, but we have established additional procedures and practices as a stand-alone public company. As a result, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a stand-alone public company. In connection with our IPO and separation from Morgan Stanley, we entered into agreements with Morgan Stanley where we agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley for, among other things, certain past, present and future liabilities related to our business. Pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with Morgan Stanley relating to the ongoing provision of services and other matters, we agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley for, among other matters, certain past, present and future liabilities related to our business. Such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities, which could be significant. See Item 1BusinessThe Separation of MSCI from Morgan Stanley. 30 Table of Contents Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock If equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our class A common stock, the price of our class A common stock could decline. The trading market for our class A common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. The price of our stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. The market price of our class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for you. For example, some of the factors that may cause the market price of our class A common stock to fluctuate include:  fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;  changes in operating margins due to variability in revenues from licensing our equity indices as the basis of ETFs;  changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;  failure of any of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance;  failure to produce or distribute our products;  changes in market valuations of similar companies;  success of competitive products;  changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;  announcements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances;  regulatory developments in the U.S., foreign countries or both;  litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;  additions or departures of key personnel;  investors general perception of us, including any perception of misuse of sensitive information;  changes in general economic, industry and market conditions; and  changes in regulatory and other dynamics. In addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management. Future sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress our class A common stock price. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the market price of our class A common stock. This would include sales of our common stock 31 Table of Contents underlying restricted shares of class A common stock and options to purchase shares of class A common stock granted in connection with our IPO and pursuant to our equity incentive compensation plan. As of November 30, 2009, 104,781,404 shares of our class A common stock were outstanding and freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by persons other than our affiliates within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In November 2007, we filed a registration statement registering under the Securities Act the 12,500,000 shares of class A common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to our officers and certain of our employees pursuant to the MSCI Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan and the 500,000 shares of class A common stock reserved for issuance in respect of equity awards made to our directors who are not employees of the Company or Morgan Stanley pursuant to the MSCI Independent Directors Equity Compensation Plan. As of November 30, 2009, we had issued 1,548,403 and 48,517 shares of class A common stock under the MSCI Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan and MSCI Independent Directors Equity Compensation Plan, respectively. Also in the future, we may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with investments and acquisitions. The amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the outstanding common stock. Provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our class A common stock. Provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our class A common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:  limitations on the removal of directors;  advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and director nominations;  the inability of shareholders, after a change in control, to act by written consent or to call special meetings;  the ability of our Board of Directors to make, alter or repeal our By-laws; and  the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without shareholder approval. Generally, the amendment of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires approval by our Board of Directors and a majority vote of shareholders. Any amendment to our By-laws requires the approval of either a majority of our Board of Directors or holders of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding capital stock in the election of our Board of Directors. Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware prohibits a person who acquires more than 15% but less than 85% of all classes of our outstanding voting stock without the approval of our Board of Directors from merging or combining with us for a period of three years, unless the merger or combination is approved by a two-thirds vote of the shares not owned by such person. These provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some shareholders. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our class A common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that a premium would be paid for your class A common stock in an acquisition. 32 Table of Contents We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our class A common stock. We do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth, including growth through acquisitions. The payment of any future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in light of conditions then existing, including our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, business conditions, corporate law requirements and other factors.
