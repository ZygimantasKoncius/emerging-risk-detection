ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS This report, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements that may be affected by several risk factors. The following information summarizes all material risks known to us as of the date of filing this report: Risks Relating to Our Company We have incurred substantial losses since our inception in 1979 and may never be profitable. Since our inception in 1979, we have never been profitable and we have not generated revenue from operations since 1990. As of December 31, 2010, our accumulated deficit was approximately $331 million (including a non-cash expense of approximately $52 million related to derivative instrument accounting in the year ended December 31, 2006, a non-cash expense of approximately $107 million related to impairment of the Company's goodwill, all of which was related to the Acquired Companies, in the year ended December 31, 2008, a non-cash expense of approximately $17 million related to the write-off of long-lived assets in the year ended December 31, 2009, and a non-cash expense of approximately $6 million related to the write-off of long-lived assets in the year ended December 31, 2010). To become profitable, we must identify additional mineralization and establish economic reserves on our properties, and then either develop our properties or locate and enter into agreements with third party operators. It could be years before we receive any revenues from production, if ever. We may suffer significant additional losses in the future and may never be profitable. We do not expect to receive revenue from operations in the foreseeable future, if at all. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. We expect to incur losses unless and until such time as one or more of our properties enter into commercial production and generate sufficient revenue to fund our continuing operations. The feasibility of mining any of our properties has not been established, meaning that we have not completed sufficient exploration or other work necessary to determine if it is commercially feasible to develop any of our properties. We are currently an exploration stage company. We have no proven or probable reserves on our properties as defined by U.S. law. A "reserve," as defined by regulation of the SEC, is that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. A reserve requires a feasibility study demonstrating with reasonable certainty that the deposit can be economically extracted and produced. We have not carried out any feasibility study with regard to any of our properties. As a result, we currently have no reserves and there are no assurances that we will be able to prove that there are reserves on our properties. The mineralized material identified on our properties does not and may never demonstrate economic viability. Substantial expenditures are required to establish reserves through drilling and additional study and there is no assurance that reserves will be established. The feasibility of mining on our El Gallo Project, Gold Bar Project, or any other property has not been, and may never be, established. Whether a mineral deposit can be commercially viable depends upon a number of factors, including the particular attributes of the deposit, including size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; metal prices, which can be highly variable; and government regulations, including environmental and reclamation obligations. If we are unable to establish some or all of our mineralized material as proven or probable reserves in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to develop a mine, even if one is warranted. If we are unable to establish such reserves, the market value of our securities may suffer, and you may lose some or all of your investment. We note that we are required to prepare and file with the Canadian securities regulators estimates of mineralized material in accordance with NI 43-101. These standards are substantially different from the standards generally permitted to report reserve and other estimates in reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Under NI 43-101, we report measured, indicated and inferred resources, 9 Table of Contents measurements which are generally not permitted in filings made with the SEC. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources reporting in our Canadian filings will ever be converted into reserves. The figures for our estimated mineralized material are based on interpretation and assumptions and may yield less mineral production under actual conditions than is currently estimated. Unless otherwise indicated, mineralization figures presented in our filings with securities regulatory authorities including the SEC, press releases and other public statements that may be made from time to time are based upon estimates made by independent geologists and our internal geologists. When making determinations about whether to advance any of our projects to development, we must rely upon such estimated calculations as to the mineralized material and grades of mineralization on our properties. Until ore is actually mined and processed, mineralized material and grades of mineralization must be considered as estimates only. These estimates are imprecise and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, which may prove to be unreliable. We cannot assure you that: these estimates will be accurate; mineralization estimates will be accurate; or this mineralization can be mined or processed profitably. Any material changes in mineral estimates and grades of mineralization will affect the economic viability of placing a property into production and such property's return on capital. There can be no assurance that minerals recovered in small scale tests will be recovered in large-scale tests under on-site conditions or in production scale. The estimates contained in our public filings have been determined and valued based on assumed future prices, cut-off grades and operating costs that may prove to be inaccurate. Extended declines in market prices for gold and/or silver may render portions of our mineralization estimates uneconomic and result in reduced reported mineralization or adversely affect the commercial viability of one or more of our properties. Any material reductions in estimates of mineralization, or of our ability to extract this mineralization, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our estimated timetables to achieve production at the El Gallo Project and the Gold Bar Project may not be accurate. Based on technical work recently completed, including Preliminary Economic Assessments at the El Gallo Project and the Gold Bar Project, we believe we can achieve production in 2014. However, the Preliminary Economic Assessments we have prepared for the El Gallo Project and the Gold Bar Project are preliminary in nature and are subject to change due to factors within and outside of our control. We have not carried out a feasibility study with regard to these or any of our properties and the feasibility of mining at these properties may never be established. There is no certainty that the preliminary assessment and economics estimated in the El Gallo Project and Gold Bar Project Preliminary Economic Assessments will be realized or that we will be able to begin production in 2014 or at all. If we decide to put one or more of our properties into production, we will require significant amounts of capital, and our ability to obtain this necessary funding will depend on a number of factors, including the status of the national and worldwide economy and the price of gold, silver and other precious metals. Fluctuations in production costs, material changes in the mineral estimates and grades of mineralization or changes in the political conditions or regulations in Mexico or Nevada may make placing these properties into production uneconomic. Further, we may also be unable to obtain the necessary permits in a timely manner, on reasonable terms or on terms that provide us sufficient 10 Table of Contents resources to develop our properties. These and other factors may cause us to delay production at the El Gallo Project and the Gold Bar Project beyond 2014, if at all. Historical production of gold at our Tonkin Complex or Magistral Mine may not be indicative of the potential for future development or revenue. Historical production of gold from our Tonkin Complex came from relatively shallow deposits, in very limited quantities and for a very limited period of time. We commenced exploration of deeper zones of our Tonkin property in 2006 in an effort to identify additional mineralized material, and have identified priority exploration drilling targets on our Tonkin Complex, Gold Bar Project and Limo Project in Nevada. In Mexico, the Magistral Mine produced gold from 2002 through 2005, but it was shut down in 2006 and is currently held by us on a care and maintenance basis. The Magistral Mine is now considered a part of our El Gallo Project. However, due to uncertainties associated with exploration, including variations in geology and structure, there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that prior drilling results are reflective of additional or economically developable deposits. Investors in our securities should not rely on our historical operations as an indication that we will ever place any of our mining properties into commercial production again. We will require significant additional capital to continue our exploration activities, and, if warranted, to develop mining operations. Substantial expenditures will be required to determine if proven and probable mineral reserves exist at any of our properties, to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal, to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any of our properties or mine sites and, in certain circumstances, to acquire additional property rights. We have spent and will be required to continue to expend significant amounts of capital for drilling, geological and geochemical analysis, assaying, and, when warranted, feasibility studies with regard to the results of our exploration. We may not benefit from these investments if we are unable to identify commercially exploitable mineralized material. If we decide to put one or more of our properties into production, we will require significant amounts of capital to develop and construct the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure required for mining operations. Our ability to obtain necessary funding for these purposes, in turn, depends upon a number of factors, including the status of the national and worldwide economy and the price of gold, silver and other precious metals. We may not be successful in obtaining the required financing, or if we can obtain such financing, such financing may not be on terms that are favorable to us. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further exploration or development and the possible, partial or total loss of our potential interest in certain properties. Any such delay could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We may acquire additional exploration stage properties and we may face negative reactions if reserves are not located on acquired properties. We may acquire additional exploration stage properties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and complete the acquisition of such properties at reasonable prices or on favorable terms and that reserves will be identified on any properties that we acquire. We may also experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we are unable to successfully complete acquisitions of additional properties or if reserves are not located on acquired properties. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock or our financial condition or results of operations. Our industry is highly competitive, attractive mineral lands are scarce, and we may not be able to obtain quality properties. We compete with many companies in the mining industry, including large, established mining companies with substantial capabilities, personnel and financial resources. There is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim staking, lease or acquisition in the U.S., Mexico, and other areas where we may conduct exploration activities. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring mineral properties, since we compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs than we do. Competition in the industry is not limited to the acquisition of mineral properties but also extends to the technical 11 Table of Contents expertise to find, advance, and operate such properties; the labor to operate the properties; and the capital for the purpose of funding such properties. Many competitors not only explore for and mine precious metals, but conduct refining and marketing operations on a world-wide basis. Such competition may result in our company being unable not only to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these resources would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows. Fluctuating gold and silver prices could negatively impact our business. The potential for profitability of our gold and silver mining operations and the value of our mining properties are directly related to the market price of gold and silver. The price of gold and silver may also have a significant influence on the market price of our common stock. The market price of gold and silver historically has fluctuated significantly and is affected by numerous factors beyond the control. These factors include supply and demand fundamentals, expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar and other currencies, interest rates, gold and silver sales and loans by central banks, forward sales by metal producers, accumulation and divestiture by exchange traded funds, global or regional political, economic or banking crises, and a number of other factors. The market price of silver is also affected by industrial demand. The selection of a property for exploration or development, the determination to construct a mine and place it into production, and the dedication of funds necessary to achieve such purposes are decisions that must be made long before the first revenues, if any, from production will be received. Price fluctuations between the time that such decisions are made and the commencement of production can have a material adverse effect on the economics of a mine. The volatility in gold and silver prices is illustrated by the following table, which sets forth, for the periods indicated (calendar year), the average annual market prices in U.S. dollars per ounce of gold and silver, based on the daily London P.M. fix. Average Annual Market Price of Gold and Silver (per oz.) Mineral 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Gold $ 604 $ 696 $ 872 $ 972 $ 1,224 Silver $ 11.54 $ 13.38 $ 14.99 $ 14.67 $ 20.19 The volatility of mineral prices represents a substantial risk which no amount of planning or technical expertise can fully eliminate. In the event gold and silver prices decline and remain low for prolonged periods of time, we might be unable to develop our properties, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial performance and cash flows. Title to mineral properties can be uncertain, and we are at risk of loss of ownership of one or more of our properties. Our ability to explore and operate our properties depends on the validity of our title to that property. Our U.S. mineral properties consist of leases of unpatented mining claims, as well as unpatented mining and millsite claims which we control directly. Unpatented mining claims provide only possessory title and their validity is often subject to contest by third parties or the federal government, which makes the validity of unpatented mining claims uncertain and generally more risky. These uncertainties relate to such things as the sufficiency of mineral discovery, proper posting and marking of boundaries, assessment work and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from public record. Since a substantial portion of all mineral exploration, development and mining in the United States now occurs on unpatented mining claims, this uncertainty is inherent in the mining industry. We have not obtained title opinions covering our entire property, with the attendant risk that title to some claims, particularly title to undeveloped property, may be defective. There may be valid challenges to the title to our property which, if successful, could impair development and/or operations. 12 Table of Contents We remain at risk in that the mining claims may be forfeited either to the United States, or to rival private claimants due to failure to comply with statutory requirements as to location and maintenance of the claims or challenges to whether a discovery of a valuable mineral exists on every claim. We have entered into a binding letter of intent to acquire a significant portion of the lode claims comprising our total interests at the Tonkin Complex that we previously leased pursuant to a lease that expired in January 2011. If we are not successful in acquiring the lode claims, our interests at the Tonkin Complex will be significantly reduced. We leased a total of 478 of our mining claims at the Tonkin Complex (Tonkin North and Cornerstone). Pursuant to the terms of the lease, the lease expired on January 1, 2011. We have entered into a binding letter of intent to acquire the claims that were subject to the lease. If we are not successful in acquiring the claims that were subject to the lease, we will lose our mineral rights associated with those claims and our interest in the Tonkin Complex will be significantly reduced. For example, if we are unable to acquire the claims, we estimate that our interest in the mineralized material that has been identified at the Tonkin Complex will be reduced by approximately 38%. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring the claims. Our continuing reclamation obligations at the Tonkin Complex, Magistral Mine and our other properties could require significant additional expenditures. We are responsible for the reclamation obligations related to disturbances located on all of our properties, including the Tonkin Complex. We have posted a bond in the amount of the estimated reclamation obligation at the Tonkin Complex. We submitted a mine closure plan to the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") for the Tonkin Complex during the fourth quarter of 2010. Based on our estimate, the change in our bonding requirements was insignificant. Our closure plan is currently under review by the BLM. We have not posted a bond in Mexico relating to the Magistral Mine, as none is required. There is a risk that any cash bond, even if increased based on the analysis and work performed to update the reclamation obligations, could be inadequate to cover the actual costs of reclamation when carried out. The satisfaction of bonding requirements and continuing reclamation obligations will require a significant amount of capital. There is a risk that we will be unable to fund these additional bonding requirements, and further, that the regulatory authorities may increase reclamation and bonding requirements to such a degree that it would not be commercially reasonable to continue exploration activities, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial performance and cash flows. Our ongoing operations and past mining activities are subject to environmental risks, which could expose us to significant liability and delay, suspension or termination of our operations. All phases of our operations are subject to U.S. and Mexican federal, state and local environmental regulation. These regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for us and our officers, directors and employees. Future changes in environmental regulation, if any, may adversely affect our operations, make our operations prohibitively expensive, or prohibit them altogether. Environmental hazards may exist on our properties that are unknown to us at the present and that have been caused by us, or previous owners or operators, or that may have occurred naturally. Mining properties from the companies we have acquired may cause us to be liable for remediating any damage that those companies may have caused. The liability could include response costs for removing or remediating the release and damage to natural resources, including ground water, as well as the payment of fines and penalties. We have transferred our interest in several mining properties over past years, some of which are now being operated by third parties. Under applicable U.S. federal and state environmental laws, as prior owner of these properties, we may be liable for remediating any damage that we may have 13 Table of Contents caused. The liability could include response costs for removing or remediating the release and damage to natural resources, including ground water, as well as the payment of fines and penalties. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions thereunder, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities, causing operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial actions. Our operations are subject to permitting requirements which could require us to delay, suspend or terminate our operations on our mining properties. Our operations, including ongoing exploration drilling programs, require permits from the state and federal governments, including permits for the use of water and for drilling wells for water. We may be unable to obtain these permits in a timely manner, on reasonable terms or on terms that provide us sufficient resources to develop our properties, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain such permits, the time required by the permitting process can be significant. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits, or if there is a delay in receiving these permits, our timetable and business plan for exploration of our properties will be adversely affected, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Legislation has been proposed that would significantly affect the mining industry. Periodically, members of the U.S. Congress have introduced bills which would supplant or alter the provisions of the General Mining Law of 1872, which governs the unpatented claims that we control with respect to our U.S. properties. One such amendment has become law and has imposed a moratorium on the patenting of mining claims, which reduced the security of title provided by unpatented claims such as those on our U.S. properties. If additional legislation is enacted, it could substantially increase the cost of holding unpatented mining claims by requiring payment of royalties, and could significantly impair our ability to develop mineral estimates on unpatented mining claims. Such bills have proposed, among other things, to make permanent the patent moratorium, to impose a federal royalty on production from unpatented mining claims and to declare certain lands as unsuitable for mining. Although it is impossible to predict at this time what royalties may be imposed in the future, the imposition of such royalties could adversely affect the potential for development of such mining claims, and the economics of existing operating mines on federal unpatented mining claims. Passage of such legislation could adversely affect our business. In March 2010, the State of Nevada enacted Assembly Bill No. 6 ("AB6") which sought to balance the state budget by reducing expenditures and increasing certain fees. Among those fee increases was a one-time fee payable in conjunction with the annual filing of an affidavit of the intent to hold a mining claim, with a tiered fee structure applied for holders of 11 or more claims. The fee ranges from $70 per claim for holders of 11 to 199 claims up to $195 per mining claim for holders of 1,300 or more claims as of the date of filing. We filed our annual affidavits of our intent to hold a mining claim on November 1, 2010 and based on the number of claims held by our subsidiaries at that time, we estimate we will have to pay approximately $0.7 million due to this fee on or before June 1, 2011. We remain at risk that Nevada may impose additional fees or other levies affecting the mining industry in the future. In Mexico, the PRI, which is the main opposition political party, with the support of other opposition parties, has introduced in the Chamber of Deputies a 4% mining royalty on production. The opposition parties collectively have a majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, with the governing PAN party a minority. The opposition numbers are sufficient (over 2/3) to override a Presidential veto in the Chamber but not in the Senate. To date, the Government has been silent on the royalty proposal. 14 Table of Contents Our operations in Mexico are subject to changes in political conditions, regulations and crime in that country. Our El Gallo Project, the Magistral Mine and the Palmarito Project as well as certain other concessions, are located in Mexico and are subject to laws and regulations applied by Mexican federal, state, and local governments. As a result, our mining investments are subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of business in foreign countries. In the past, Mexico has been subject to political instability, changes and uncertainties which may cause changes to existing government regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities. Civil or political unrest or violence could disrupt our operations at any time. In 2010 and 2011, there has been an increase in the level of violence and crime relating to drug cartels in Sinaloa State, where we operate, and in other regions of Mexico. This may disrupt our ability to carry out exploration and mining activities and affect the safety and security of our employees and contractors. Our exploration and mining activities may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that could increase the costs related to our activities or maintaining our properties. Our lack of operating experience may cause us difficulty in managing our growth. We are currently in the exploration stage and our management has limited experience in developing and operating a mine. We are currently working towards developing our El Gallo Project in Mexico and our Gold Bar Project in Nevada. Our ability to manage our growth, if any, will require us to improve and expand our management and our operational and financial systems and controls. If our management is unable to manage growth effectively, our business and financial condition would be materially harmed. In addition, if rapid growth occurs, it may strain our operational, managerial and financial resources. We are subject to litigation risks. All industries, including the mining industry, are subject to legal claims, with and without merit. Defense and settlement costs can be substantial, even with respect to claims that have no merit. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The nature of mineral exploration and production activities involves a high degree of risk and the possibility of uninsured losses that could materially and adversely affect our operations. Exploration for minerals is highly speculative and involves greater risk than many other businesses. Many exploration programs do not result in the discovery of mineralization, and any mineralization discovered may not be of sufficient quantity or quality to be profitably mined. Few properties that are explored are ultimately advanced to production. Our current exploration efforts are, and any future development or mining operations we may elect to conduct will be, subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and developing mineral properties, such as, but not limited to: economically insufficient mineralized material; fluctuations in production costs that may make mining uneconomical; availability of labor, power, transportation and infrastructure; labor disputes; potential delays related to social and community issues; unanticipated variations in grade and other geologic problems; environmental hazards; water conditions; difficult surface or underground conditions; 15 Table of Contents industrial accidents; metallurgical and other processing problems; mechanical and equipment performance problems; failure of pit walls or dams; unusual or unexpected rock formations; personal injury, fire, flooding, cave-ins and landslides; decrease in reserves due to a lower silver price; and decrease in reserves due to a lower gold price. Any of these risks can materially and adversely affect, among other things, the development of properties, production quantities and rates, costs and expenditures, potential revenues and production dates. We currently have no insurance to guard against any of these risks. If we determine that capitalized costs associated with any of our mineral interests are not likely to be recovered, we would incur a writedown of our investment in these interests. All of these factors may result in losses in relation to amounts spent which are not recoverable. We do not insure against all risks to which we may be subject in our planned operations. While we currently maintain insurance to insure against general commercial liability claims and physical assets at the Tonkin Complex, we do not maintain insurance to cover all of the potential risks associated with our operations. Certain of our exploration projects such as Gold Bar and Limo have no existing infrastructure for which we insure, and we do not insure our limited physical assets at the Magistral Mine. For example, we do not have insurance on the mine assets associated with the Magistral Mine and we do not have business interruption insurance. We may also be unable to obtain insurance to cover other risks at economically feasible premiums or at all. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available, or may not be adequate to cover liabilities. We might also become subject to liability for environmental, pollution or other hazards associated with mineral exploration and production which may not be insured against, which may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or which we may elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons. Losses from these events may cause us to incur significant costs that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fund activities on our property. A significant loss could force us to reduce or terminate our operations. We depend on a limited number of personnel and the loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business. Our company is dependent on key management, namely our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, our Senior Vice President and Vice President, Projects. Robert R. McEwen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for strategic direction and the oversight of our business. Perry Y. Ing, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for our public reporting and administrative functions. Our Senior Vice President, Ian Ball, and Vice President, Projects, Stefan Spears, oversee corporate or project development in Mexico and Nevada, respectively. We rely heavily on these individuals for the conduct of our business. The loss of any of these officers would significantly and adversely affect our business. In that event, we would be forced to identify and retain an individual to replace the departed officer. We may not be able to replace one or more of these individuals on terms acceptable to us. We have no life insurance on the life of any officer. Some of our directors may have conflicts of interest as a result of their involvement with other natural resource companies. Some of our directors are directors or officers of other natural resource or mining-related companies, or may be involved in related pursuits that could present conflicts of interest with their roles at US Gold. These associations may give rise to conflicts of interest from time to time. 16 Table of Contents In the event that any such conflict of interest arises, a director who has such a conflict is required to disclose the conflict to a meeting of the directors of the company in question and to abstain from voting for or against approval of any matter in which such director may have a conflict. In appropriate cases, we will establish a special committee of independent directors to review a matter in which several directors, or management, may have a conflict. We are subject to foreign currency risk. While we transact most of our business in U.S. dollars, some expenses, such as labor, operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in Canadian dollars or Mexican pesos. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact our operating costs. The appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies against the U.S. dollar increases costs and the cost of purchasing capital assets in U.S. dollar terms in Canada and Mexico, which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows. Conversely, a depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies usually decreases operating costs and capital asset purchases in U.S. dollar terms in foreign countries. The value of cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates. Appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies results in a foreign currency gain on such investments and a depreciation in non-U.S. dollar currencies results in a loss. We have not utilized market risk sensitive instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates but may in the future actively manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We also hold a majority of our cash reserves in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Global climate change is an international concern, and could impact our ability to conduct future operations. Global climate change is an international issue and receives an enormous amount of publicity. We would expect that the imposition of international treaties or U.S. or Mexican federal, state or local laws or regulations pertaining to mandatory reductions in energy consumption or emissions of greenhouse gasses could affect the feasibility of our mining projects and increase our operating costs. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock Gain recognized by non-U.S. holders and non-U.S. persons holding any interest in the Company other than solely as a creditor (including, for example, interests in the form of our convertible debt, if any) on the sale or other disposition of our securities may be subject to U.S. federal income tax. We believe that we currently are a "United States real property holding corporation" under section 897(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, or USRPHC, and that there is a substantial likelihood that we will continue to be a USRPHC in the future. Subject to certain exceptions, securities (other than securities that provide no interest in a corporation other than solely as a creditor) issued by a corporation that has been a USRPHC at any time during the preceding five years (or the non-U.S. holder's holding period for such securities, if shorter) are treated as U.S. real property interests, or USRPIs, and gain recognized by a non-U.S. holder on the sale or other disposition of a USRPI is subject to regular U.S. federal income tax, on a net basis at graduated rates, as if such gain were effectively connected with the conduct by such holder of a U.S. trade or business. If gain recognized by a non-U.S. holder from the sale or other disposition of our common stock or other securities is subject to regular net basis income tax under these rules, the transferee of such common stock or other securities may be required to deduct and withhold a tax equal to 10 percent of the amount realized on the sale or other disposition, unless certain exceptions apply. Any tax withheld may be credited against the U.S. federal income tax owed by the non-U.S. holder for the year in which the sale or other disposition occurs. The conversion of outstanding exchangeable shares, exercise of options and the future issuances of our common stock will dilute current shareholders and may reduce the market price of our common stock. As of March 9, 2011, we had outstanding exchangeable shares and options to purchase a total 7,708,729 shares of our common stock, which if completely converted or exercised, would dilute existing shareholders' ownership by approximately 5%. Under certain circumstances, our Board of Directors has 17 Table of Contents the authority to authorize the offer and sale of additional securities without the vote of or notice to existing shareholders. We may issue equity in the future in connection with acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. Based on the need for additional capital to fund expected growth, it is likely that we will issue additional securities to provide such capital and that such additional issuances may involve a significant number of shares. Issuance of additional securities in the future will dilute the percentage interest of existing shareholders and may reduce the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the sale of a significant amount of common stock by any selling security holders, specifically Robert R. McEwen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, may depress the price of our common stock. As a result, you may lose all or a portion of your investment. A small number of existing shareholders own a significant portion of our common stock, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of any shareholder vote. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Robert R. McEwen, beneficially owns approximately 22% of our common stock as of March 9, 2011. Under our Articles of Incorporation and the laws of the State of Colorado, the vote of a majority of the shares voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present is generally required to approve most shareholder action. As a result, this individual will be able to significantly influence the outcome of shareholder votes for the foreseeable future, including votes concerning the election of directors, amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or proposed mergers, acquisitions or other significant corporate transactions. Our stock price has historically been volatile, and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment.

We have not paid a dividend on our common stock to date, and we may not be in a position to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to successfully develop one or more properties and generate revenue from operations. Further, our initial earnings, if any, will likely be retained to finance our growth. Any future dividends will depend upon our earnings, our then-existing financial requirements and other factors, and will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
