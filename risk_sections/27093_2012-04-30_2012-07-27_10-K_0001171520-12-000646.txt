Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects are subject to a variety of significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of some of the important risk factors particular to our business and industry that may cause our actual results in future periods to differ substantially from those we currently expect or seek. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. There are additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be unlikely or immaterial that also may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects. WE HAVE INCURRED NET LOSSES IN RECENT YEARS AND OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY IS NOT ASSURED. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010, we incurred net losses of approximately $3.3 million, $4.6 million, and $10.7 million, respectively. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we cannot assure you that we will not continue to experience net losses for the foreseeable future. If we are not able to increase revenue and reduce our costs, we may not be able to achieve profitability. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL FOR CONTINUED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. The development of the XcelaSAN product line has required substantial capital investment. The Company believes that it has sufficient capital resources for the continued development of the products. There can be no assurance, however, that such capital resources will be sufficient for the Company's purposes or that those additional sources of capital and or financing will be available if needed. If we require and are unable to raise additional funds, we may need to delay, scale-back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs and/or license third parties to develop and commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize ourselves. WE MAY HAVE TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE EVENT OF DRAM ALLOCATIONS. Over the past 20 years, availability of DRAMs has swung back and forth from oversupply to shortage. In times of shortage, we have been forced to invest substantial working capital resources in building and maintaining inventory. At such times we have bought DRAMs in excess of our customers' needs in order to ensure future allocations from DRAM manufacturers. In the event of a shortage, we may not be able to obtain sufficient DRAMs to meet customers' needs in the short term, and we may have to invest substantial working capital resources in order to meet long-term customer needs. WE COULD SUFFER ADDITIONAL LOSSES IF DRAM PRICES CONTINUE TO DECLINE. We are at times required to maintain substantial inventories during periods of shortage and allocation. Thereafter, during periods of increasing availability of DRAMs and rapidly declining prices, we have been forced to write down inventory. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer losses in the future based upon high inventories and declining DRAM prices. OUR SALES, REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD FLUCTUATE SEASONALLY AND FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER. The demand for our products is somewhat seasonal, with December and January tending to be the slowest months. Moreover, our sales, revenues, and ultimate results of operation may vary for a variety of reasons. Such reasons could include, for example, changes in general economic conditions or consumer demand, the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, a significant purchase or sale of assets or other business combination or an unanticipated event effecting us or our industry, among other factors. Such variability in operating results may affect credit terms offered to us or affect the value of the common stock. IN ORDER TO COMPETE AND SUCCEED, WE NEED TO INTRODUCE, AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE, PRODUCTS THAT PROVIDE VALUE FOR CUSTOMERS. Our future success is dependent on the development of new markets where possible, and new applications and new products which customers believe will add value, as well as the continued demand for our products among our existing customers. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to exploit new markets or continue to develop products that achieve wide customer acceptance in the marketplace, or that demand for existing products will continue. 11 WE MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGIC PLANS. The Company presently has plans to expand its sales of memory and RAMDisk products, to develop new business opportunities based on its existing expertise and software, to continue to seek and evaluate possible strategic alliances to enhance its sales, and to develop and monetize additional intellectual property. These plans, however, are subject to modification or replacement by management if it decides that economic, industry, technological, regulatory or other factors warrant a change. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will successfully implement all such plans or that circumstances in the marketplace and the economy will allow the implementation of such plans. IF WE FAIL TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN FAVORABLE PRICING AND CREDIT TERMS FROM OUR VENDORS, OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE HARMED AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Our costs are affected by our ability to achieve favorable pricing and credit terms from our vendors and contract manufacturers, including through negotiations for vendor rebates and other vendor funding received in the normal course of business. Because these supplier negotiations are continuous and reflect the ongoing competitive environment, the variability in terms can negatively affect our costs and operating results if we cannot sufficiently adjust pricing or cost variables. IN ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY EMPLOYEES, AND OUR FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense. If we continue to suffer losses, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. OUR PRODUCTS MAY VIOLATE OTHERS' PATENTS. Certain of our products are designed to be used with proprietary computer systems built by various OEM manufacturers. We often have to comply with the OEM's proprietary designs which may be patented, now or at some time in the future. OEMs have, at times, claimed that we have violated their patent rights by adapting our products to meet the requirements of their systems. It is our policy to, in unclear cases, either obtain an opinion of patent counsel prior to marketing, or obtain a license from the patent holder. We are presently licensed by Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics to sell memory products for certain of their products. However, there can be no assurance that product designs will not be created in the future which will, in fact, be patented and which patent holders will require the payment of substantial royalties as a condition for our continued presence in the segment of the market covered by the patent or they may not give us a license. Nor can there be any assurance that our existing products do not violate one or more existing patents. WE MAY LOSE AN IMPORTANT CUSTOMER. During fiscal 2012, the largest ten customers accounted for approximately 41% of the Company's revenues and one customer accounted for 11% of the Company's revenues. There can be no assurance that one or more of these customers will not cease or materially decrease their business with the Company in the future and that our financial performance will not be adversely affected thereby. SALES DIRECTLY TO OEM'S AND CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS CAN MAKE OUR REVENUES, EARNINGS, BACKLOG AND INVENTORY LEVELS UNEVEN. Revenue and earnings from OEM sales may become uneven as order sizes are typically large and often a completed order cannot be shipped until released by the OEM, e.g., to meet a "just in time" inventory requirement. This may occur at or near the end of an accounting period. In such case, revenues and earnings could decline for the period and inventory and backlog could increase. WE FACE COMPETITION FROM OEMs. In the compatibles market we sell our products at a lower price than OEMs. Customers will often pay some premium for the "name brand" product when buying additional memory and OEMs seek to exploit this tendency by having a high profit margin on memory products. However, individual OEMs can change their policy and price memory products competitively. While we believe that with our manufacturing efficiency and low overhead we still would be able to compete favorably with OEMs, in such an event profit margins and earnings would be adversely affected. Also, OEMs could choose to use "free memory" as a promotional device in which case our ability to compete would be severely impaired. 12 WE FACE COMPETITION FROM DRAM MANUFACTURERS. DRAM manufacturers not only sell their product as discrete devices, but also as finished memory modules. They primarily sell these modules directly to OEMs and large distributors and as such compete with us. There can be no assurance that DRAM manufacturers will not expand their market and customer base, and our profit margins and earnings could be adversely affected. THE MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY NARROW OVER TIME. The principal market for our memory products consists of the manufacturers, buyers and owners of workstations and enterprise servers, classes of machines lying between large mainframe computers and personal computers. Personal computers are increasing in their power and sophistication and, as a result, are now filling some of the computational needs traditionally filled by workstations. The competition for the supply of after-market memory products in the PC industry is very competitive and to the extent we compete in this market we can be expected to have lower profit margins. There can be no assurance that this trend will not continue in the future, and that our financial performance will not be adversely affected. A PORTION OF OUR OPERATIONS IS DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE VERY COMPETITIVE INTEL AND AMD PROCESSOR-BASED MOTHERBOARD MARKET. In addition to selling server memory systems, we develop, manufacture and market a variety of memory products for motherboards that are Intel or AMD processor based. Many of these products are sold to OEMs and incorporated into computers and other equipment. This is an intensely competitive market with high volumes but lower margins. ANY CLAIM THAT OUR PRODUCTS ARE DEFECTIVE COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. We undertake to produce consistently high-quality products, free of defects and errors. Nevertheless, it is possible that our products, may contain errors or defects. Our products are complex and must meet stringent user requirements, and we have consistently provided a lifetime warranty for our products. Any customer claims of errors or defects could result in increased expenditures for product testing, or increase our service costs and potentially lead to increased warranty claims. Errors or defects in our products may be caused by, among other things, errors or defects in the memory or controller components, including components we procure from third parties. These factors could result in the rejection of our products, product recalls, damage to our reputation, lost revenues, diverted development resources, increased customer service and support costs, warranty claims and litigation. We record an allowance for warranty and similar costs in connection with sales of our products, but actual warranty and similar costs may be significantly higher than our recorded estimate and harm our operating results and financial condition. WE MAY MAKE UNPROFITABLE ACQUISITIONS. The Company is actively looking at acquiring complementary products and related intellectual property. The possibility exists that an acquisition will be made at some time in the future. Uncertainty surrounds all acquisitions and it is possible that a particular acquisition may not result in a benefit to shareholders, particularly in the short-term. In addition, there can be no assurance that the business of MMB acquired by the Company will remain a profitable operating unit of the Company or that savings from having a larger consolidated business operation will continue. THE INVESTMENTS WE MAKE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MAY NOT LEAD TO PROFITABLE NEW PRODUCTS. The Company has implemented a strategy to introduce new and complementary products into its offerings portfolio, and expects to spend substantial sums of money on research and development of such possible new products. Specifically, the Company has made considerable investments in research and development of the XcelaSAN product line. There can be no assurance, however, that these research and development expenditures will result in the identification or exploitation of any products that can be profitably sold by the Company. WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. A portion of our accounts receivable and a portion of our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies. These proportions change over time. As a result, the Company's revenues and expenses may be adversely affected, from time to time, by changes in the relationship of the dollar to various foreign currencies on foreign exchange markets. Currently, the Company does not hedge its foreign currency risks, but could do so in the future. 13 WE MAY INCUR INTANGIBLE ASSET AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WHICH COULD HARM OUR PROFITABILITY. The Company took an impairment charge of $2.4 million on capitalized software development costs that were written down to zero in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We periodically review the carrying values of our intangible assets and goodwill to determine whether such carrying values exceed the fair market value. Our goodwill is subject to an annual review for goodwill impairment. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying value exceeds its fair value, the intangible assets or goodwill is deemed impaired. Accordingly, an impairment charge would be recognized in the period identified, which could reduce our profitability. THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PRICE AND VOLUME VOLATILITY AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE FUTURE. Our stock price has experienced significant price and volume volatility for the past several years, and our stock price is likely to experience significant volatility in the future, which could result in investors losing all or part of their investments. We believe that such fluctuations will continue as a result of many factors, including financing plans, future announcements concerning us, our competitors or our principal customers regarding financial results or expectations, technological innovations, industry supply and demand dynamics, new product introductions, governmental regulations, the commencement or results of litigation or changes in earnings estimates by analysts, as well as a result of numerous factors outside our control. Significant declines in our stock price may interfere with our ability to raise additional funds through equity financing or to finance strategic transactions with our stock. A significant adverse change in the market value of our common stock could also trigger an interim goodwill impairment test that may result in a non-cash impairment charge. In addition, we have historically used equity incentive compensation as part of our overall compensation arrangements. The effectiveness of equity incentive compensation in retaining key employees may be adversely impacted by volatility in our stock price. OUR STOCK HAS LIMITED LIQUIDITY. Although our stock is publicly traded, it has been observed that this market is "thin." As a result, the common stock may trade at a discount to what would be its value if the stock enjoyed greater liquidity. WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE. We have rarely declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares. OUR STOCK COULD BE DELISTED FROM THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET. On January 31, 2012, The Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ OMX Group ("NASDAQ") notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the $1 per share minimum bid price requirement for continued inclusion on The NASDAQ Capital Market set forth in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) for the last 30 consecutive trading days prior to the date of NASDAQ's letter. NASDAQ's letter has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company's common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market, and its common stock will continue to trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "DRAM." In accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, the Company has until July 30, 2012 to regain compliance. The letter further advises that such compliance can be achieved if, at any time before July 30, 2012, the closing bid price of the Company's common stock is at least $1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days. NASDAQ's letter further states that if the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by July 30, 2012, it may be eligible for an additional 180 day period to regain compliance. The Company is actively pursuing available options to regain compliance, and has submitted a request to NASDAQ for an additional 180 day grace period to regain compliance. WE MAY HAVE TO EFFECT A REVERSE SPLIT IN ORDER TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE FOR LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET. If the Company’s share repurchase program does not succeed in raising the closing price of the Company’s common stock to $1.00 or more for ten consecutive trading days, the Company may have to effect a reverse split sufficient enough to achieve the $1.00 minimum price for the required period. 14 WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE NEW JERSEY SHAREHOLDERS PROTECTION ACT. This statute has the effect of prohibiting any "business combination" - a very broadly defined term - with any "interested shareholder" unless the transaction is approved by the Board of Directors at a time before the interested shareholder had acquired a 10% ownership interest. This prohibition of "business combinations" is for five years after the shareholder became an "interested shareholder" and continues after that time period subject to certain exceptions. A practical consequence of this statute is that a hostile acquisition of our Company is unlikely to occur and hostile transactions which might be of benefit to our shareholders are unlikely to occur. WE ARE A PARTY TO A LITIGATION THAT COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COST AND PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES. The landlord for property previously leased by the Company in Ivyland, Pennsylvania filed suit against the Company, which vacated the property at the expiration of its lease. The Company denies liability and, after consulting with legal counsel, estimates that any amounts ultimately due by the Company will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition. The Company does not believe at this time that an unfavorable outcome is likely. The ultimate outcome of the suit is unknown, however, and an unfavorable decision may result in monetary damages that could adversely affect the financial resources of the Company. ADVERSE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INSTABILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. Adverse or worsening economic conditions or the instability of financial markets in the United States, Europe, Asia or other parts of the world have a negative affect on our business. When there are such adverse conditions or instability, many of our direct and indirect customers may delay or reduce their purchases of our products and systems containing our products. In addition, several of our customers rely on credit financing in order to purchase our products. If the negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers' access to credit or render them insolvent, orders for our products may decrease, which would result in lower revenue. Likewise, if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products, or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent, they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products. We believe we have obtained adequate available insurance to address the business which can be insured against with respect to our business. However, these events could result in reductions in our revenue, increased price competition, and increased operating costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE AFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. Government regulators, or our customers, may in the future require us to comply with product or manufacturing standards that are more restrictive than current laws and regulations related to environmental matters, conflict minerals or other social responsibility initiatives. The implementation of these standards could affect the sourcing, cost and availability of materials used in the manufacture of our products. For example, there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals used in our products, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face challenges with regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free. Non-compliance with these standards could cause us to lose sales to these customers and compliance with these standards could increase our costs, which may harm our operating results. CHANGES TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CAUSE US TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES. We prepare our financial statements to conform to U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC, and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in those policies can have a significant effect on our consolidated reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change in accounting principles is announced. Changes to those rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. 15 WE MAY SUFFER A BREACH OF OUR COMPUTER SECURITY MEASURES, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our information technology systems, we may lose proprietary data or suffer damage to our business. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and result in unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We believe we have obtained adequate available insurance to address the business which can be insured against with respect to our business. However, any security breach could result in disclosure of our trade secrets or confidential customer, supplier or employee data, or harm our ability to carry on our business, all of which could result in legal liability, harm to our reputation and otherwise harm our business. ARMED HOSTILITIES, TERRORISM, NATURAL DISASTERS, PROPERTY DAMAGE, PUBLIC HEALTH OR OTHER ISSUES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. Armed hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters, damage to property (through fire, flood, or other similar occurrence), telecommunications or transportation/shipping interruptions, epidemic or public health issues, whether in the U.S. or abroad, could cause damage or disruption to us, our facilities and infrastructure, our suppliers, or our customers, or could create political or economic instability, any of which could harm our business. These events could cause a decrease in demand for our products, could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products or for our suppliers to deliver components, and could create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain. We believe we have obtained adequate available insurance to address the business which can be insured against with respect to our business, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover such risks or would adequately remediate any harm to us from any such event. The severe flooding in Thailand which occurred during Fiscal 2012 caused damage to infrastructure and factories that resulted in a shutdown for several months of hard drive manufacturing, which has resulted in shortages and price increases and has otherwise adversely affected our operations. If we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of this event (or of any future event) these events on our customers and operations, our business and financial results could suffer. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
