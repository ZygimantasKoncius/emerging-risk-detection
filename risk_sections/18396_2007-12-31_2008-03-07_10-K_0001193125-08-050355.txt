Item 1A. Risk Factors CDIs business involves a number of risks, many of which are beyond its control. The risks and uncertainties described below could individually or collectively have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, assets, profitability or prospects. While these are not the only risks and uncertainties the Company faces, management believes that the more significant risks and uncertainties are as follows: CDIs business is heavily dependent on capital spending by customers in the industries it serves, and cuts in capital spending and economic downturns may result in the loss of revenues and profitability. The demand for the Companys services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and the level of capital spending by the Companys customers. The pace of customer capital spending programs, new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for project outsourcing and both temporary and permanent employees. Any deterioration in the economic condition of the United States or any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in any specific industry served, could have a negative effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. The Companys continued success is dependent on its ability to hire and retain qualified employees, both management and billable personnel. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. CDI depends upon its ability to attract qualified personnel who possess the skills and experience required by its customers and to successfully bid for new customer projects. CDI must continually evaluate its base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing customer needs and emerging technologies. Competition for individuals with proven professional or technical skills always exists, and the demand for such individuals (particularly in certain engineering disciplines and geographic areas) is expected to remain very strong in the foreseeable future. There is always uncertainty as to whether qualified personnel will continue to be available to CDI in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to CDI. The Companys operations also depend on the continued efforts of its executives and senior management. The loss of key members of CDIs management team may cause a significant disruption to the Companys business. CDI also depends on the performance and productivity of its local managers and sales and recruiting personnel. The Companys ability to attract and retain new business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered. The loss of key managers and field personnel may also jeopardize existing customer relationships, which could cause revenues to decline. 7 The Company may experience adverse consequences arising out of an ongoing investigation by the U.K. Office of Fair Trading. In June 2006, the United Kingdoms Office of Fair Trading (OFT) opened an investigation into alleged anti-competitive behavior by Anders and a number of its competitors in the U.K. construction recruitment industry. The allegations being investigated include, among others, the competitors agreeing to minimum fees in their contracts with U.K. intermediary recruitment companies and declining to work with one particular U.K. intermediary recruitment company. Anders is cooperating with the OFT in the investigation under the OFTs corporate leniency program. Management believes it is likely that the OFT will ultimately impose a fine on Anders. Although it is not possible to determine with any reliability the amount or materiality of that fine, the fine could be material and this matter could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. It is also possible that third-party civil lawsuits may be filed against Anders in connection with this matter. Anders has incurred legal fees and could incur significant incremental legal fees in connection with the OFT investigation and in defending any third-party lawsuits. Furthermore, this matter and the related publicity could adversely affect the reputation of Anders and the Company. Senior management at Anders and the Company may need to devote a significant amount of time with regard to this matter, which could distract them from the operation of the business. The Company has not made any provision for any fine or other liabilities relating to this matter in the Companys consolidated financial statements. CDI is engaged in highly competitive businesses. Pricing pressures and increasing consolidation of purchasing by its customers could reduce the Companys market share and profits. The engineering, IT and professional staffing businesses are highly competitive and fragmented, with limited barriers to entry for staffing services. CDI competes in global, national, regional, and local markets with numerous engineering and IT outsourcing companies and with temporary staffing and permanent placement firms. Price competition among companies in CDIs industry and pricing pressures from customers are significant. The number of customers which consolidate their purchases of engineering and IT outsourcing and staffing services with a single provider or with a small number of providers has continued to rise. This trend to consolidate purchases can make it more difficult for the Company to obtain or retain customers. The Company could also face the risk that certain customers may decide to provide similar services internally. Additionally, pricing pressures have intensified as customers have continued to competitively bid new contracts. This trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, which could limit CDIs ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability. The Companys revenues are subject to uncertainties. CDIs results of operations depend on new contract awards, and the selection process and timing for performing these contracts are subject to contingencies beyond its control. In addition, the Companys customer contracts and arrangements may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by its customers. A significant portion of revenues is directly or indirectly derived from awards of long-term projects. It is difficult to predict whether and when the Company will receive such awards due to the lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, financing arrangements, governmental approvals and environmental matters. Because a meaningful portion of revenues is generated from projects, the Companys results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of contract awards. Furthermore, substantially all of the Companys contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the customer. In addition, project contracts are generally subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided. CDI, particularly in its Government Services vertical, is a party to prime contracts and subcontracts involving the federal government. Contracts with the U.S. and other governments and their agencies are subject to particular uncertainties, restrictions and regulations. The U.S. Government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for a program can be eliminated. Accordingly, the Company does not have a guaranteed backlog of business. The failure of customers to pay amounts owed to CDI could cause the Company to experience significant losses. Accounts receivable represent the largest asset on CDIs balance sheet. While the Company takes steps to evaluate and manage the credit risks relating to its customers, economic downturns or events specific to particular customers or industries could reduce CDIs ability to collect all amounts due from customers. In addition, in the staffing business, there are sometimes intermediaries between CDI and the customer, and therefore financial problems involving the intermediary company could pose credit risks to CDI. CDI faces competition from global outsourcing companies, which may result in a loss of market share and reduced profitability. There is increasing pressure from customers on their suppliers to outsource certain areas of their businesses to low-cost offshore locations. Many engineering and IT outsourcing and staffing companies already have or are seeking an offshore solution to support their technology and business process functions, and as a result, a significant amount of domestic technology and engineering project work may utilize offshore capabilities as alternatives to domestic resources. CDI has established lower cost outsourcing centers and has partnered with offshore companies to provide additional lower cost options to its 8 customers. Conducting business through offshore arrangements entails additional compliance and regulatory issues and may result in additional costs. CDIs partnering arrangements are subject to the Companys ability to maintain good working relationships with its foreign partners and on its partners ability to fulfill their obligations under CDIs agreements with them. Changes in the supply and demand for offshore personnel with the training to perform the IT and engineering services sought by CDIs customers, as well as other factors affecting offshore labor costs, could raise CDIs costs which would put pressure on its margins. Also, other offshore solution providers could develop direct relationships with CDIs customers resulting in a significant loss of the Companys market share and revenue. Foreign currency fluctuations, weak foreign economies and unfavorable political developments in connection with CDIs growing international operations could seriously harm its financial condition. CDIs international operations are important to its business and the Company expects that it will continue to account for an increasing portion of its total revenues. At a minimum, its reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar. CDIs exposure to foreign currency fluctuations relates primarily to operations denominated in British pounds sterling, Euros and Canadian dollars. From time to time, the Company engages in hedging activities with respect to its foreign operations. The Companys international operations are subject to a variety of other risks, including:  Recessions in foreign economies and the impact on costs of doing business in those countries;  Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  The adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade restrictions and the failure to comply with U.S. export control laws;  The lack of well-developed legal systems and less established or traditional business practices in some countries, which could make it difficult for CDI to enforce its contractual rights;  Exposure to liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;  Social, political and economic instability, including risks of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, insurrection and terrorism;  Limitations on the movement of cash and the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and  Logistical and communications challenges. CDIs projects may encounter difficulties that result in additional costs, reductions in revenues, claims, disputes and the payment of damages. CDIs projects often involve complex design and engineering, significant procurement of equipment and supplies and broad construction management. The Company may encounter difficulties in the design or engineering, equipment and supply delivery, schedule changes and other factors, some of which are beyond its control, that impact its ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery schedule. In addition, the Company often relies on third-party equipment manufacturers as well as third-party subcontractors to assist with the completion of its contracts. Any delay by subcontractors to complete their portion of the project, or any failure by a subcontractor to satisfactorily complete its portion of the project, as well as other factors beyond the Companys control, may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or cause CDI to incur additional costs, or both. These delays and additional costs may be substantial, and the Company may be required to compensate the customer for these delays. While CDI may recover these additional costs from the responsible vendor, subcontractor or other third-party, the Company may not be able to recover all of these costs in all circumstances. In addition, some contracts may require CDIs customers to provide it with design or engineering information or with equipment or materials to be used on the project. In some cases, the customer may provide CDI with deficient design or engineering information or equipment or may provide the information or equipment to it later than required by the project schedule. The customer may also determine, after commencement of the project, to change various elements of the project. CDI is subject to the risk that it might be unable to obtain, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or otherwise, adequate amounts to compensate it for the additional work or expenses incurred due to customer requested change orders or failure by the customer to timely provide required items. A failure to obtain adequate compensation for these matters could require CDI to record an adjustment to amounts of revenues and gross profit that were recognized in prior periods. Any such adjustments, if substantial, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. The Company bears the risk of cost overruns in fixed-price contracts. CDI, within its ES segment, sometimes enters into fixed-price contracts with customers, primarily for engineering project services. Revenue recognized under fixed-price contracts accounts for less than 5% of consolidated revenue in each of the past three years. Under these fixed-price contracts, prices are established based on cost and scheduling estimates, which in turn are based in part on assumptions about the prices and availability of skilled personnel, equipment, and materials. If the Companys price estimates for a particular project prove to be inaccurate, then cost overruns may occur, and CDI could experience 9 reduced profits or a loss for that project and the Companys reputation could be harmed. Cost overruns may also be caused by changes in the scope of the project after the contract has been entered into or by a failure of the parties to adequately define and agree upon the entire scope of the project at inception. In those cases, there may be disputes between the parties over who should pay for the cost overruns. The Company will attempt to negotiate change orders to recover the additional costs, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its negotiations with its customers. In general, fixed-price contracts can offer greater profit potential but also entail more inherent riskboth in terms of possible financial losses and the potential for significant disputes with customersthan contracts containing pricing on a time-and-materials basis. The Companys project outsourcing services expose it to potential professional liability, product liability, warranty and other claims. In connection with certain of its project outsourcing services, the Company engineers and perform services in various types of facilities, including major industrial facilities, where accidents or system failures can be disastrous. Any catastrophic occurrences in excess of insurance limits relating to locations or products which are engineered by the Company or locations where its services are performed could result in significant professional liability, product liability, warranty and other claims against the Company. Furthermore, the project outsourcing services CDI provides expose it to additional risks including equipment failures, personal injuries, property damage, and unforeseen engineering, architectural and environmental problems, each of which could significantly impact the Companys performance and materially impact its financial statements. Changes in government regulations could result in loss of business and/or increased costs. CDIs business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material in the future. Any inability to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements, or increase in the cost of compliance, could materially adversely affect the Company. New government regulations could disrupt or reduce existing business done by the Company, though it can also provide new business opportunities. Changes in government regulations could result in the imposition of new or additional benefits, licensing or tax requirements, thereby increasing CDIs costs of doing business. There can be no assurance that CDI would be able to increase the fees charged to its customers in a timely manner or in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing. Staffing services entail employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in customers workplaces. Therefore, increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer- employee relationship could materially adversely affect the Company. The outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. From time to time, various types of legal claims arise in connection with the ordinary course of CDIs business. Employees of the Company may make a variety of claims including workplace injury claims and employment-related claims such as discrimination, harassment, and wage and hour claims. Since the Companys staffing business involves employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing them in customer workplaces where CDI has limited ability to control the workplace environment, these types of claims may arise more frequently in those business operations. The Companys customers may make claims based on the Companys alleged failure to perform in accordance with contract requirements. Since the Companys project business often involves responsibility to produce specified deliverables, these types of claims may arise more frequently in those business operations. Customers in the staffing business may allege claims based on the conduct of staffing employees assigned to the customers worksite. Customers and subcontractors may make claims alleging the Companys failure to abide by certain contract provisions. In addition, the Company is subject to possible government claims or fines for violations of various laws. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. CDI has significant payroll-related costs, such as workers compensation, unemployment taxes and health benefits, which are subject to increases caused by government regulation and other factors, and such increases could reduce its profits. In conducting its business, CDI is required to pay a number of payroll and related costs and expenses, including unemployment taxes, workers compensation and medical insurance for its personnel. Unemployment insurance premiums paid by employers typically increase during periods of increased levels of unemployment. Workers compensation costs may increase in the future if states raise benefit levels and liberalize allowable claims. The Company self-insures a portion of the exposure for losses related to workers compensation. The Company has established reserves for workers compensation claims based on historical loss statistics and periodic independent actuarial valuations. While management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Companys future financial results. CDIs future earnings could be adversely affected if it is not able to increase the fees charged to customers to absorb the increased costs related to unemployment insurance, workers compensation and medical benefits. In addition, its future earnings could also be adversely affected by future cost increases. 10 Estimates of the Companys income tax liabilities are subject to various uncertainties, which could reduce profits or result in incorrect forecasts of future tax rates. When financial statements are prepared, CDI estimates its income tax liabilities with respect to the various jurisdictions in which the Company does business. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income tax liabilities in the financial statements and in forecasting CDIs effective income tax rate in a given period. The provision for income taxes and tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and audits by taxing authorities. Future acquisitions, if any, may not be successful. The Company may selectively pursue acquisitions as an element of its growth strategy, but it can not provide assurances that it will be able to locate suitable acquisitions or that it will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company, or that such transactions will be successful. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including the diversion of managements attention from its existing operations, the failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business, and the inability to successfully integrate the business. There can be no assurance that any future acquired businesses will generate anticipated revenues or earnings. Disasters could interfere with CDIs ability to operate its business. Certain of the Companys customers operate in areas that may be impacted by severe weather conditions. Various types of natural or man-made disasters could interfere with the Companys continued ability to operate its business normally. For example, the Companys ability to protect its data centers and information systems against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, and other disasters is critical. In order to provide many of its services, CDI must be able to store, retrieve, process, and manage large databases and periodically expand and upgrade its capabilities. Any damage to the Companys data centers or any failure of the Companys telecommunication links that interrupts its operations or results in an inadvertent loss of data could adversely affect CDIs ability to meet its customers needs and their confidence in utilizing CDI for future services. While the Company has developed various backup plans and disaster recovery plans, there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to continue to operate its business smoothly in the face of certain natural or man-made disasters. Such business interruptions could significantly harm CDIs financial results and future prospects. The Company services the oil, gas, and chemical industries, each of which have a significant concentration of activities in the Gulf Coast of the United States. This area can be impacted by severe weather, negatively impacting CDIs customers and its ability to serve them. The Company relies on information systems in its operations. Failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect CDIs business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, the Companys business could be harmed. The efficient operation of CDIs business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems. Information systems are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists. The Company relies on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on its information systems. However, these measures and technology may not always be adequate to properly prevent security breaches. In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt CDIs business and could result in decreased performance and increased overhead costs, causing the Companys business and results of operations to suffer. Any significant interruption or failure of CDIs information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect its business and results of operations. CDI relies on outside suppliers to perform certain administrative services. CDI outsources certain data processing, payroll and other administrative functions to companies that specialize in performing those services. The failure of such outside service providers to adequately perform such services could have a material adverse effect on CDIs business and operations. If CDI fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to accurately report its financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, investors could lose confidence in the Companys financial reporting, which would harm its business and the trading price of its stock. Effective internal controls are necessary for CDI to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, its operating results could be harmed. CDI devotes significant attention to establishing and maintaining effective internal controls. Implementing any appropriate changes to internal controls, if ever required, may require specific compliance training of the Companys directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs in order to modify its existing accounting systems and take a significant period of time to complete. The Company cannot be certain that these measures, if required, would ensure that it implement and maintain adequate controls over its financial reporting processes and related Section 404 reporting requirements. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could affect CDIs operating results or cause it to fail to meet reporting obligations in future periods. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in the 11 Companys reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the market price of CDI stock. The Company may not be able to obtain the insurance coverages necessary to manage its risks. The Company relies on insurance to help manage its risks and to limit the Companys exposure to significant claims. The future availability and cost of such insurance is subject to market forces and CDIs claims experience. There can be no assurance that the Company can always obtain and maintain appropriate insurance coverage, including errors and omissions insurance, in order to effectively manage the risks of its business. A significant portion of the Companys common stock is owned by related parties, and they could vote their shares in a way that is adverse to the interests of other shareholders. Certain of CDIs directors and trusts, for which some of the Companys directors serve as trustee, own a substantial portion of the Companys outstanding common stock. By virtue of this stock ownership, such shareholders have the power to significantly influence CDIs affairs and are able to influence the outcome of matters required to be submitted to shareholders for approval, including the election of directors and the amendment of the Companys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. Such shareholders could exercise influence over the Company in a manner adverse to the interests of CDIs other shareholders. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.
