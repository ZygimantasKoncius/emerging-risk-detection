Item 1A. Risk Factors The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face, but are those that we have identified as being the most significant factors that make investment in our stock speculative or risky or that have special application to us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not know about, or that we deem less significant than those identified below, may also make investment in our stock speculative or risky. If any of 10 the adverse events associated with the risks described below occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such a case, the trading price of our stock could decline. Federal health care reform and financial reform may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was signed into law by President Obama during March 2010. PPACA requires us, for certain products in certain lines of business, to increase benefits, to limit rescission to cases of intentional fraud and, eventually, to insure pre-existing conditions, among other things. If, for those products, our actual loss ratios fall short of required minimum loss ratios (by state and legal entity, subject to certain adjustments), we will be required to rebate the difference to consumers. We have made, and are continuing to make, significant changes to our operations, products and strategy to adapt to the new environment. If our plans for operating in the new environment are unsuccessful or if there is less demand than we expect for our products in the new environment, our results could be adversely affected. Additionally, in July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), which implements comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the U.S. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). While the CFPB does not have direct jurisdiction over insurance products, it is possible that regulations promulgated by the CFPB may extend its authority more broadly to cover certain insurance products and thereby may adversely affect our results of operations. Our investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses. In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may greatly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer. We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations under these securities could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the continued recognition of investment losses. The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the preferred stocks and bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the continued recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio. In particular, at December 31, 2010, fixed maturities represented $53.7 million or 83% of our total investments of $64.4 million. The fair market value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair market value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipate d because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates. For mortgage−backed securities, credit risk exists if mortgagees default on the underlying mortgages. Although at December 31, 2010, approximately 97.6% of the fixed maturities were investment grade, all of our fixed maturities are subject to credit risk. If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could fall (with a concurrent fall in fair value) and, in a worst case scenario, the issuer could default on its financial obligations. If the issuer defaults, we could have realized losses associated with the impairment of the securities. The impact of market value fluctuations affects our Consolidated Financial Statements. Because all of our fixed maturities are classified as available for sale, changes in the fair market value of our securities are reflected in our stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss). No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates. Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows. 11 We review our investment securities regularly and determine whether other-than-temporary impairments have occurred. For fixed maturities, if a decline in fair value is judged by management to be other-than-temporary, and we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the securitys amortized cost, the impairment is bifurcated into (a) the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss, and (b) the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized by a charge to total other-than-temporary impairment losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, establishing a new cost basis for the security. The amount of the other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The factors considered by management in its regular review include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; adverse changes in ratings announced by one or more rating agencies; subordinated credit support; whether the issuer of a debt security has remained current on principal and interest payments; current expected cash flows; whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or, alternatively, a reflection of general market or industry conditions (including, in the case of fixed maturities, the effect of changes in market interest rates); and our intent to sell, or be required to sell, the debt security before the anticipated recovery of our remaining amortized cost basis. Therefore, changes in facts and circumstances and critical assumptions could result in managements decision that further impairmen ts have occurred. This could lead to additional losses on investments, particularly those that management has the intent and ability to hold until recovery in value occurs. Our earnings could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill. Goodwill represented $23.6 million of our $133.3 million in total assets as of December 31, 2010. We review our goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We regularly assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may include: a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in the business climate; and/or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change in one of these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. If we experience a sustained decline in our results of operations and cash flows, or other indicators of impairment exist, we may incur a material non-cash charge to earnings relating to impairmen t of our goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on our results. Changes in state regulations, or the application thereof, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A number of states are contemplating significant reform of their health insurance markets. These proposals include provisions affecting both public programs and privately financed health insurance arrangements. We cannot assure you that, if enacted into law, any of these proposals would not have a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Less-fundamental change in the regulatory requirements imposed on us may also harm our business or results of operations. For example, some states have imposed time limits for the payment of uncontested covered claims and required health care and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices. If we were unable, for any reason, to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If rating agencies downgrade our insurance company, our results of operations and competitive position in the industry may suffer. Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Independence American is rated A- (Excellent) by A.M. Best, whose ratings reflect its opinions of an insurance company's financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to 12 meet its obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed to investors. The rating of Independence American is subject to periodic review by A.M. Best. If A.M. Best were to reduce Independence American's ratings from current levels, our business would be adversely affected. Our loss reserves are based on an estimate of our future liability, and if actual claims prove to be greater than our reserves, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. We maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses where material, including legal and other fees, and costs not associated with specific claims but related to the claims payment functions for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, we cannot be sure that current reserves will prove adequate. If our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and loss adjustment expenses, we would have to augment our reserves and incur a charge to our earnings, and these charges could be material. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on our assessment of known facts and circumstan ces. Many factors could affect these reserves, including economic and social conditions, frequency and severity of claims, medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation, changes in utilization and demand for medical services, and changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable in advance. Additionally, there may be a significant reporting lag between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is reported to us. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities, particularly those in which the various considerations affecting the type of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Reserve estimates are continually refined in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled, and are reflected in the results of the period s in which such estimates are changed. Our results may fluctuate as a result of factors generally affecting the insurance and reinsurance industry. The results of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. Factors that affect the industry in general could also cause our results to fluctuate. The industry and our financial condition and results of operations may be affected significantly by: · Fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment, which affect returns on invested capital; · Rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products; · Losses related to epidemics, terrorist activities, random acts of violence or declared or undeclared war; · Changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that may arise and the development of judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers' liability; · The overall level of economic activity and the competitive environment in the industry; · Greater than expected use of health care services by members; · New mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that change the scope of business or increase our costs; and · Failure of MGUs to adhere to underwriting guidelines as required by us in its MGU agreements. The occurrence of any or a combination of these factors, which is beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our results. The stock transfer restriction in our certificate of incorporation may not protect against adverse tax consequences. Although the stock transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation are intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change, it will not prevent all transfers that might result in an "ownership 13 change." Furthermore, certain changes in relationships and other events not addressed by the stock transfer restrictions could cause us to undergo an "ownership change." Section 382 of the Code is an extremely complex provision with respect to which there are many uncertainties. In addition, we have not requested a ruling from the IRS regarding the effectiveness of the stock transfer restrictions and, therefore, we cannot be certain that the IRS will agree that the stock transfer restrictions are effective for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. Further, we cannot assure that the stock transfer restrictions or portions thereof will be enforceable in Delaware courts or that the IRS would agree that all of our tax net operating loss carryforwards are allowable. In addition, our board of directors may determine, in its sole discretion, to permit a restricted transfer that results in an "ownership change" if it determines that such transfer is in our best interests. Therefore, the stock transfer restrictions were to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, the risk that Section 382 of the Code will cause limitations on the use of our tax attributes. Our inability to assess underwriting risk accurately could reduce our net income. Our success is dependent on our ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses on which we retain risk. If we fail to assess accurately the risks we retain, we may fail to establish the appropriate premium rates and our reserves may be inadequate to cover our losses, requiring augmentation of the reserves, which in turn would reduce our net income. Our agreements with our producers (including our MGUs) require that each producer follow underwriting guidelines published by us and amended from time to time. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in termination or modification of the agreement. We perform periodic audits to confirm adherence to the guidelines, but it is possible that we would not detect a breach in the guidelines for some time after the infraction, which could result in a material impact on the Net Loss Ratio (defined as insurance benefits, claims and reserves divided by (premiums earned less underwriting expenses)) for that producer and could have an adverse impact on our operating results. If we fail to comply with extensive state and federal regulations, we will be subject to penalties, which may include fines and suspension and which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors. This regulation, generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business, relates to, among other things: · Approval of policy forms and premium rates; · Standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements, which are a measure developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and used by state insurance regulators to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized; · Licensing of insurers and their agents and regulation of their conduct in the market; · Restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments; · Restrictions on transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates; · Restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy; · Requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders; · Requiring certain methods of accounting; · Prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed; and · Requiring reserves for unearned premium, losses and other purposes. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies, holding company issues and other matters. A large portion of our business depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our ability to maintain valid licenses and approvals for our operations. Regulatory authorities have broad discretion to 14 grant, renew, or revoke licenses and approvals. Regulatory authorities may deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations, or interpretations that we believe to be generally followed by the industry, which may be different from the requirements or interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals and do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our insurance-related activities or otherwise penalize us. That type of action could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry (whether federal, state or foreign), or changes in laws or regulations themsel ves or interpretations by regulatory authorities, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be unsuccessful in competing against larger or better-established business rivals. Our industry is highly competitive and has experienced severe price competition from time to time over the last several years. We face competition from domestic and international insurance and reinsurance companies, from underwriting agencies, and from diversified financial services companies that are much larger than we are. Some of these competitors have greater financial, marketing and other resources, have been operating longer than we have and have established long-term and continuing business relationships through the industry, which can be a significant competitive advantage. In addition to competition in the operation of its business, we face competition from a variety of sources in attracting and retaining qualified employees. We cannot assure you that we will maintain our current competitive position in the markets in which we operate, or that we will be able to expand our op erations into new markets and compete effectively in the future. If we fail to do so, our business could be materially adversely affected. The occurrence of various events may adversely affect our ability to utilize fully our NOL carryforwards. We have U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $274 million, which may be used against any profits from our business. However, events outside of our or IHCs control, such as certain acquisitions and dispositions of our common stock, may limit the use of all or a portion of our NOL carryforwards. If such events were to occur, our expectation of using our NOL carryforwards against potential profits would not be realized and we could potentially have a higher tax liability in the future than we would otherwise have had. As the NOL carryforwards are utilized by AMIC, the amount of our NOL carryforwards could be reduced upon audit by the IRS for those tax years open for assessment under the statute of limitations. We rely on reinsurance arrangements to help manage our business risks, and failure to perform by the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements may expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate. We utilize reinsurance to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Our reinsurers may be unable or unwilling to pay the reinsurance recoverable owed to us now or in the future or on a timely basis. A reinsurers insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to protect our policyholders confidential information and privacy could adversely affect our business. In the conduct of our business, we are subject to privacy regulations and to confidentiality obligations. For example, the collection and use of patient data in our health insurance operations is the subject of national and state legislation, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and certain other activities we conduct are subject to the privacy regulations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. We also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors, partners and policyholders. These obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information. If we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information, we could experience adverse 15 consequences, including regulatory sanctions, such as penalties, fines and loss of license, as well as loss of reputation and possible litigation. Certain of our business arrangements are terminable by other parties. Independence American currently reinsures 20% of Standard Security Lifes short-term statutory disability benefit product, but Standard Security Life is not contractually obligated to continue to cede this business to Independence American after termination of the current treaty year. Standard Security Life and Madison National Life also ceded approximately 9% of the majority of their fully insured health business lines to Independence American. Standard Security Life and Madison National Life are not contractually obligated to continue to cede this business to Independence American after termination of the current treaty years. Standard Security Life and Madison National Life ceded approximately 20%, on average, of their medical stop-loss business to Independence American in 2009, however, they are not contractually obligated to cede amounts in excess of 15%. Our MGUs are significant producers of medical st op-loss business for IHC, producing 44% of total IHC stop-loss premium in 2010. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None
