risk factors unique to the business of each borrower. In order to mitigate these risks, we seek to gain an understanding of the business of each borrower, place appropriate value on collateral taken and structure the loan properly to make sure that collateral values are maintained while loans are outstanding. Appropriate documentation of commercial business loans is also important to protect our interests. Our credit approval process for commercial loans is comprehensive and our underwriting process includes an evaluation of the borrowers historical and projected balance sheet, income statement, liquidity and cash flow as well as the strength of the collateral to determine the level of creditworthiness of the borrower. We typically review the current and future cash needs of the borrower, its business strategy, managements ability to execute the strategies, and the strength of any guarantors. While our loan policy has guidelines for advances on different types of collateral, we establish eligible asset values on a case-by-case basis for each borrower. Generally, the commercial business loans are secured by a first priority security interest in all the assets of the borrower and also include the personal guarantees of business owners. The repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the ability of the borrower to generate cash and the creditworthiness of the borrower, since liquidation of collateral is often a secondary and potentially insufficient source of repayment due to inventory or assets being obsolete, or accounts receivable becoming uncollectible. We may also provide letter of credit services to certain borrowers on a case-by-case basis. Underwriting, structuring and collateralization of letters of credit are similar to that used in other commercial loans. Lending Concentrations. Our largest lending relationship at December 31, 2005, involved $74.0 million of credit exposure, the majority of which is comprised of construction and land loans. Aggregate credit exposure to our ten largest lending relationships at December 31, 2005, was approximately $316 million. The majority of our loans are made in our Chicago and Milwaukee market areas. Of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2005, 70.8% are loans secured by property located in Illinois and 24.8% by property located in Wisconsin. Environmental Issues. We encounter certain environmental risks in our lending activities. Under federal and state environmental laws, and in certain circumstances, lenders may become liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous materials found on security property. To mitigate environmental related risks to us, our loan policies call for management to consider all relevant factors in order to determine whether an environmental review is needed and, if so, the scope and detail, prior to our origination of commercial and multi-family loans. Although environmental risks are usually associated with industrial and commercial loans, there are also risks for residential lenders like us if environmental contamination makes the collateral property unsuitable or has an adverse effect on nearby property values. 6 Table of Contents No assurance can be given that the values of properties securing loans in our portfolio will not be adversely affected by unforeseen environmental risks, although we are unaware of any such environmental issues which subject us to potential material liability at this time. Secondary Market and Loan Servicing Activities Originations, Purchases and Sales of Mortgage Loans. Our mortgage origination volumes, and the mix of fixed-rate and ARM products in our originations, are significantly dependent on the interest rate environment, consumer preferences and the expected level of future interest rates. We originate the majority of our mortgage loan and home equity line production through our internal sales force of approximately 150 commissioned loan officers and 15 E-commerce loan originators. We also have established relationships with a number of mortgage brokers operating in our market areas from whom we purchase loans, primarily home equity products, based on our published rate sheets and in conformity with our underwriting guidelines and usually in whole loan transactions where we assume the servicing. However, we expect to continue to originate the majority of our mortgage and home equity loan production through our own sales force and our retail branch network. We typically originate and sell the majority of our fixed rate residential mortgages for interest rate risk and liquidity management purposes. We also sell ARM loan production depending on market conditions and our interest rate management strategy. Loan sales provide a significant source of liquidity for the Bank. In 2006, we intend to continue to pursue opportunities to sell both single-family mortgage and home equity products into the secondary market. We expect to significantly expand the amount of ARM loans sold into the secondary market in 2006 to limit balance sheet growth and help mitigate some of the net interest margin pressure in the current difficult yield environment. We had our first equity loan sales during 2005, selling $139.3 million in equity loans on a servicing-released basis. These accounts represented primarily wholesale purchases and single-service borrowers where the customers had a limited account relationship with the Bank. The following table shows the Banks one- to four-family mortgage and home equity originations and purchases and loan sale activity for the periods indicated: At or For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) 1-4 Family Originations and Purchases: Fixed-rate $ 674,882 33 % $ 905,182 38 % $ 2,188,658 55 % Adjustable-rate 1,363,816 67 1,481,547 62 1,790,163 45 Total 2,038,698 100 % 2,386,729 100 % 3,978,821 100 % Equity lines of credit(1) 1,201,936 1,151,971 592,167 Home equity loans 48,389 17,381 7,982 Loans Sales: One- to four-family loans: Fixed-rate(2) 661,641 96 % 649,789 71 % 1,604,896 91 % Adjustable-rate(2) 24,839 4 264,292 29 162,056 9 Total 686,480 100 % 914,081 100 % 1,766,952 100 % Equity loans 139,270   Gain on sale of: 1-4 family loans 7,100 9,294 25,948 Home equity loans 3,575   Total loan sale gains 10,675 9,294 25,948 Margin on loan sales: One- to four-family sales 1.03 % 1.02 % 1.47 % Equity loans 2.57 %   Loan Servicing Gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights $ 2,400   Loan servicing fee income (expense) 2,261 1,231 (5,939 ) Valuation recovery on mortgage servicing rights 171 2,072 1,130 (1) Represents total disbursements during the year on all home equity lines, including amounts related to lines newly originated during the year and lines previously outstanding. This does not reflect any unused amounts that remain available at year end. (2) Loans sold includes one- to four-family originations that are swapped into mortgage-backed securities and sold simultaneously and does not includes $37.2 million in 2005 and $252.8 million in 2004 of Bank originated loans swapped into mortgage-backed securities and held in portfolio. 7 Table of Contents Of our fixed-rate originations in 2005, $551.0 million, or 82%, conformed to the requirements for sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and $123.9 million, or 18%, were non-conforming. Our non-conforming loans are generally designated as such because the principal loan balance exceeds $359,650 ($417,000 as of January 1, 2006), which is the Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and MPF purchase limit, and not because the loans present increased risk of default. Non-conforming loans, or jumbo loans with such higher balances, generally carry interest rates from one-eighth to one quarter of one percent higher than similar, conforming fixed-rate loans. Jumbo loans are priced higher to compensate for their higher risks of prepayment. In the last two years we have generally sold most of our conforming and non-conforming long-term fixed-rate loan originations. We generally sell our conforming long-term fixed-rate production to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, or the MPF program of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, commonly referred to as GSEs, or government sponsored entities. Since 2002, we have been selling most of our non-conforming long-term fixed-rate production to private investors, providing an alternative to reduce our interest rate risk that we will continue to pursue in the future. We often enter into forward commitments for loan sales with various investors based on our mortgage production pipeline as our primary hedge of price risk. The majority of our loans are sold without recourse, except those loans sold through the MPF program, where we retain a limited level of risk in exchange for better pricing on the loans sold. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $14.0 million in net credit risk exposure on loans we have sold through the MPF program. Loan servicing. We typically retain servicing rights on single family mortgage loans that we sell into the secondary market. Loan servicing fee income is generated from loans that we have originated and sold, and includes fees for the collection and remittance of mortgage payments, insurance premiums and real estate taxes. We receive a monthly servicing fee for performing the aforementioned services equal to at least .25% of the outstanding principal balance of the sold loans being serviced. Costs of servicing loans for others are charged to expense as incurred, while we capitalize mortgage servicing rights upon the sale of loans based on assumptions as to fee income earned, estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgage loans, and the cost of servicing. Mortgage servicing rights are intangible assets and are amortized based on the estimated life of the loan servicing income stream, which is recorded as a decrease to loan servicing fee income. Our mortgage servicing rights are assessed quarterly for impairment, with any impairment or recovery recognized through a valuation allowance and a related charge to earnings. The following table shows the components of loan servicing fee income (expense) in dollars and as a percentage of loans serviced for others, as well as other information regarding loans serviced for others for the years indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Gross servicing revenue $ 9,302 9,312 6,983 Amortization of mortgage servicing rights (7,041 ) (8,081 ) (12,922 ) Loan servicing fee income (expense), net $ 2,261 1,231 (5,939 ) As a percentage of average loans serviced for others: Gross servicing revenue .260 % .277 .278 Amortization of mortgage servicing rights (.197 ) (.241 ) (.515 ) Loan servicing fee income (expense) .063 % .036 (.237 ) Average balance of loans serviced for others $ 3,582,886 3,357,002 2,509,345 Loans serviced for others at end of year(1) 2,919,075 3,641,445 3,330,039 Mortgage servicing rights at end of year, net 20,007 25,697 24,128 Average service fee at year end .26 % .28 .26 Mortgage servicing rights as a percentage of mortgage loans serviced for others .69 % .71 .72 Multiple of average servicing fee at year end 2.6 x 2.5 x 2.8 x Weighted-average interest rate on loans serviced for others 5.69 % 5.70 5.89 (1) One- to four-family loans serviced for other investors which are primarily GSE and to a lesser extent private investors.

(2) Percentage represents the sold principal balance of delinquent loans to total sold loans outstanding. We completed a sale of servicing rights on $750.0 million of loans, or 21% of our one- to four-family mortgage loans serviced for others portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2005 at a pre-tax gain of $2.4 million. The loan servicing rights were sold to take advantage of an increase in servicing values early in the fourth quarter and represented primarily single service customers we determined would not become multiple account customers after our cross-sell efforts. Swaps for Mortgage-Backed Securities. We have and may continue to exchange or swap loans out of portfolio into mortgage-backed securities, primarily with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The mortgage-backed securities may then be sold simultaneously, or held as mortgage-backed securities available for sale or held to maturity. Generally, the mortgage-backed securities are used to collateralize borrowings and deposits or are sold in the secondary market to raise additional funds. Our swap activity is governed by pricing levels in the secondary mortgage market for whole mortgage loans versus securitized mortgage loans, as well as the level of rates for collateralized borrowings. During the current year, we swapped and sold $5.4 million in loans receivable, compared to $49.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. In 2005, we also swapped $37.2 million of 15-year fixed rate loans into mortgage-backed securities held to maturity to help manage our risk-based capital position at the Bank in addition to providing collateral for borrowings. Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses We work with customers and business clients to provide a wide range of lending products designed to meet their individual requirements, while adhering to our internal underwriting standards that have allowed us to maintain strong credit quality and minimize credit losses historically. Delinquent Loans. When a borrower fails to make a required payment by the end of the month in which the payment is due, we generally institute collection procedures. When a loan payment is delinquent for three or more monthly installments, we will generally initiate foreclosure proceedings and cease accruing interest. At December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, delinquencies in our portfolio were as follows: 61-90 Days > 90 Days(2) Numberof Loans PrincipalBalance ofDelinquentLoans As aPercentof TotalLoans(1) Numberof Loans PrincipalBalance ofDelinquentLoans As aPercentof TotalLoans(1) (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2005 79 $ 9,039 .12 % 356 $ 31,160 .43 % December 31, 2004 93 8,557 .12 283 31,473 .46 December 31, 2003 43 4,851 .08 255 32,787 .51 (1) Percentage represents principal balance of delinquent loans to total loans outstanding.

Non-accrual loans. Generally, when a loan more than 90 days or more past due, in the process of foreclosure, or in bankruptcy, or when collectibility is otherwise in doubt, the full amount of previously accrued but unpaid interest on non-accrual loans is deducted from interest income. Income is subsequently recorded to the extent cash payments are received, or at the time when the loan is brought current in accordance with its original terms. This policy is applied consistently for all types of loans in the Banks loan portfolio. For each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the amount of interest income that would have been recorded on non-accrual loans if these loans were performing in accordance with their terms amounted to $1.4 million. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, interest income on non-accrual loans that was actually collected and recorded amounted to $563,000 $630,000, and $718,000, respectively. The majority of our non-performing loans are secured by one- to four-family residential real estate in our market area which we generally regard as presenting lower risk of credit loss due to the nature of the collateral. Our loss exposure is reduced as approximately 36% of our non-accrual loans at December 31, 2005, are covered by private mortgage insurance. Ratios for loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties were as follows: At December 31, 2005 2004 One- to four-family loans as a percentage of total loans(1) 77 % 78 % Non-performing one- to four-family loans as a percentage of total non-performing loans(1) 93 89 Percentage of non-performing one- to four-family loans with private mortgage insurance or other guarantees 36 46 Average loan-to-value of non-performing one- to four-family loans without private mortgage insurance or other guarantees 69 66 (1) Includes equity lines of credit and home equity loans. Impaired Loans. We consider a loan impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. Impairment for loans considered individually significant and that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the determined fair value of an impaired loan is less than the carrying value of the loan and a loss has deemed to have occurred, we charge off the principal amount of the loan in excess of fair value or net realizable value. For loans that are not individually significant (i.e. loans under $1.0 million), and represent a homogeneous population, we evaluate impairment collectively based on management reports on the level and extent of delinquencies, as well as historical loss experience for these types of loans. These homogeneous loans are excluded from the impaired loan disclosures. We use these criteria on one- to four-family residential loans, consumer loans, smaller multi-family residential loans, and land loans. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had $2.1 million and $3.4 million of impaired loans, respectively. The average balance of impaired loans for 2005 and 2004 was $2.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Classified Assets. The federal regulators have adopted a classification system for problem assets of insured institutions, which covers all problem assets and requires certain reserves. Under this classification system, problem assets of insured institutions are classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and 10 Table of Contents paying capacity of the obligor or the value of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. In addition, a special mention category consists of assets, which currently do not expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant adverse classification, but do possess credit deficiencies deserving managements close attention. In connection with our filing of periodic reports with the OTS, we regularly review the problem assets in our portfolio to determine whether any loans or investments require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. At December 31, 2005 all of our non-performing loans were classified as substandard. In addition, at December 31, 2005, we had classified $3.5 million of multi-family loans, $8.2 million of commercial real estate loans and $2.5 million of commercial business loans as substandard for regulatory purposes that were still accruing interest. At December 31, 2004 all of our non-performing loans were classified as substandard except $113,000 that was classified as doubtful. At December 31, 2004, we had classified $4.4 million of multi-family loans and $24.8 million of commercial loans as substandard for regulatory purposes that were still accruing interest. We had $1.6 million of commercial loans classified as doubtful of which $113,000 were non-accrual and the remaining $1.5 million were still accruing interest. Special mention loans at December 31, 2005 and 2004 totaled $23.9 million and $10.2 million, respectively. Allowance for Loan Losses. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and determining the related provision for loan losses, if any, management considers: (1) historical loss experience and the change in the mix of the overall portfolio composition over the last five years, (2) specific allocations based upon probable losses identified during the review of the portfolio, (3) delinquency in the portfolio and the composition of non-performing loans, including the percent of non-performing loans with supplemental mortgage insurance, and (4) subjective factors, including local and general economic business factors and trends, portfolio concentrations and changes in the size and/or general terms of the loan portfolio. Larger loans, typically secured by commercial real estate, that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. It is our opinion that, the allowance, when taken as a whole, is adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2005. While we use available information to recognize losses on loans, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and the impact of such change on the Banks borrowers. 11 Table of Contents The allowance for loan losses totaled $36.5 million at December 31, 2005, or .51% of total loans receivable, exclusive of loans held for sale, and $36.3 million, or .53% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2004. An analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years indicated is presented in the table below.

This allocation is based on managements subjective estimates. The amount of reserves allocated to a particular category may not be indicative of actual future losses, and amounts allocated to particular categories may change from year to year based on changes in managements assessment of the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. An unallocated reserve is maintained to recognize the imprecision in measuring and estimating loss when evaluating reserves for individual loans or categories of loans. The allocation methods used during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were generally consistent. The allowance allocations as a percentage of one- to four- family, multi-family, construction and land loans were relatively unchanged and the increase in the allocation amounts is primarily related to portfolio growth and continued stable asset quality trends. The allowance allocation amount as a percentage of equity lines of credit was up modestly compared to the prior year as we experienced a higher level of charge-offs in 2005 and a larger dollar amount of non-performing assets. The allowance allocation amount and as a percentage of commercial real estate was down due to a higher level of charge-offs of loans and overall improved portfolio quality and delinquency trends as the corporate sector continues to improve. The unallocated reserve decreased in 2005 based on consideration of the improving economic conditions and related improvements in our delinquency ratios. 12 Table of Contents At December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Allowance Loancategory as% of TotalLoans Allowance Loancategory as% of TotalLoans Allowance Loancategory as% of TotalLoans Allowance Loancategory as% of TotalLoans Allowance Loancategory as% of TotalLoans (Dollars in thousands) One- to four-family $ 8,988 58.88 % $ 8,627 58.69 % $ 8,594 61.33 % $ 9,062 79.02 % $ 9,755 82.56 % Equity lines of credit 7,000 17.78 6,758 18.62 5,420 14.13 2,080 8.83 1,448 6.01 Home equity loans 338 .90 329 .80 320 1.05 216 .73 293 1.21 Multi-family 4,130 9.53 3,912 9.40 3,721 9.78 2,030 5.90 1,730 4.60 Commercial real estate 9,599 6.57 10,610 6.93 11,304 8.20 2,846 3.25 2,646 3.26 Construction 1,936 2.15 1,691 1.96 759 1.74 426 .76 501 .88 Land 1,875 2.08 1,157 1.35 870 1.15 531 .92 656 .90 Commercial business 2,225 2.03 2,180 2.14 2,087 2.02 397 .47 250 .43 Consumer 46 .08 47 .11 191 .60 80 .12 63 .15 Unallocated reserve 358 N/A 944 N/A 1,289 N/A 1,815 N/A 2,265 N/A Total $ 36,495 100.00 % $ 36,255 100.00 % $ 34,555 100.00 % $ 19,483 100.00 % $ 19,607 100.00 % At December 31, 2005, our loan portfolio consisted of $4.25 billion of one- to four-family real estate loans, with an additional $1.35 billion of equity lines of credit or home equity loans on one- to four-family real estate and other consumer loans which totaled 77% of our portfolio. At December 31, 2005, 36% of the one- to four-family non-performing loans carried private mortgage insurance or government guarantees and the average loan-to-value ratio on the one- to four-family non-performing loans without supplemental mortgage insurance was 69%. Based on our underwriting standards, overall loan-to-value ratios, concentration of lending primarily in our market area, and historically low charge-off experience, we consider the risk of loss on these loans to be low. The remaining 23% of the Banks portfolio, or $1.62 billion, consist of multi-family mortgage, commercial real estate, construction, land and commercial business loans. Our net income could be affected if our estimate of the amount of loan loss that may be incurred is materially different than actual results, which could require an additional provision for loan losses and a respective charge to earnings. We believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate at December 31, 2005. However, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and the impact of such changes may have on our borrowers. Investment Activities Our strategy is to use our investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolios as stable sources of interest income and to provide flexibility in managing our interest rate risk and liquidity needs. For this reason, we keep our portfolios relatively short-term in nature and seek to limit exposure to credit risk. These portfolios represented a combined 21.0% of our total assets at December 31, 2005 compared to 19.2% at December 31, 2004. We maintain a majority of our investment and mortgage-backed securities in an available for sale portfolio, and we may sell these securities for liquidity needs, to alter asset/liability management strategies or to manage risk-based capital levels. The classification of investments and mortgage-backed securities as held to maturity, available for sale or trading is made at the time of purchase based upon managements intent at that time. At December 31, 2005, our $475.2 million of investment securities classified as available for sale had a cost basis of $480.2 million. Mortgage-backed securities available for sale had a fair value of $1.31 billion with a cost basis of $1.34 billion. At December 31, 2005, we had $243.2 million of mortgage-backed securities in a held to maturity portfolio in which the loans underlying these securities are loans we originated and swapped into mortgage-backed securities. We owned $165.7 million of stock in the FHLB of Chicago at December 31, 2005, which is carried at cost, representing 1.6% of total assets and 16.9% of stockholders equity. At December 31, 2005, we were required to hold $123.6 million of stock, based on our outstanding credit obligations to the FHLB of Chicago. We may, subject to the discretion of the FHLB of Chicago, redeem at par any capital stock greater than our required investment. While our voluntary investment in FHLB stock has yielded us a higher than market return in recent years, in mid 2004, we began reducing our voluntary stock position at the recommendation of our asset liability committee (ALCO) in order to lower the investment concentration that resulted from our recent acquisitions. We redeemed $125.6 million of FHLB of Chicago 13 Table of Contents stock in 2005 and $125.7 million in 2004. We expect to redeem our remaining excess investment when the FHLB of Chicago is permitted by its regulators to resume redemptions. See Regulation and Supervision-Federal Home Loan Bank System. The following table sets forth certain information regarding the carrying value of our investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolios at the dates indicated.

These securities are excluded in the calculation of average life. Actual repricings and yields of the securities may differ from that reflected in the table depending upon actual interest rates and callable features of those investments. (2) The yield reflects the dividend declared for the fourth quarter of 2005. (3) The yields to maturity of mortgage-backed securities are based upon estimated future cash flow and prepayments. The yields on these securities may differ from that reflected in the table depending upon actual interest rates and prepayment experience. The bank trust preferred securities shown in the tables above represent investments in several different pools of collateralized debt securities consisting of primarily 30-year capital securities issued by various banks, thrifts and insurance companies. The underlying pool of issuers of the collateralized debt securities are well diversified as to asset size and geography. These securities are primarily LIBOR-indexed floating rate securities and contain an issuer call provision at par anytime after five years. The individual issuers of trust preferred securities have the ability to defer interest payments for up to 20 consecutive quarters in certain circumstances. At December 31, 2005, the $61.9 million of bank trust preferred securities classified as available for sale had a cost basis of $61.4 million. During 2004, we recorded a $2.0 million other-than-temporary impairment on two Freddie Mac floating-rate preferred stock securities with an aggregate carrying value of $8.8 million. We recorded the write-down because the current yield on these securities was below market interest rates, the fair value was below cost for an extended period, and a recovery in fair value was not assumed within a reasonably 14 Table of Contents short period of time. We determined that an impairment charge on these securities was not necessary during 2005. Investment Subsidiary. The Bank has a wholly-owned subsidiary organized as a Nevada corporation that was acquired in the St. Francis acquisition. This subsidiary holds and manages a portfolio of our investment securities. At December 31, 2005, the Banks total investment in the Nevada subsidiary was approximately $433.7 million, and the subsidiary had assets of $433.2 million consisting primarily of mortgage-backed securities. Wisconsin does not require consolidated tax returns and because the investment subsidiary is out of state, its income has not been subject to state income tax in Wisconsin. From time to time legislation has been proposed that would require consolidated reporting requirements in Wisconsin. Representatives of the Wisconsin Department of Revenue have indicated that the Department may revoke its previously issued favorable tax rulings relating to such Nevada subsidiaries, even though there has not been any intervening change in law. The Department also has implemented a program for the audit of Wisconsin financial institutions that have subsidiaries incorporated and located in Nevada, and may seek to assert a basis for imposition of Wisconsin income taxes on income from those operations, either retroactively or prospectively. We are not currently under audit by the Department. Other Investments. In addition to our investment securities and mortgage-backed securities portfolios, we maintain a portion of our assets in more liquid investments for daily liquidity management. Our liquid investments include interest-bearing deposits, primarily at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, federal funds sold and U.S. Government and federal agency obligations. We invest overnight federal funds with two large commercial banks in Chicago, based upon periodic review of these institutions financial condition. We generally limit overnight federal funds sold investments to $100.0 million at any one institution. Deposits We offer a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms. Our deposits consist of passbook accounts, interest-bearing and non-interest bearing checking accounts, money market and certificate accounts. We rely primarily on competitive pricing policies, advertising, and customer service to attract and retain deposits. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and prevailing interest rates and competition. In the last several years, we have emphasized growth in core accounts, defined as commercial and non-interest bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, money market accounts, and passbooks. At December 31, 2005, the ratio of core deposits to total deposits decreased to 53.4% compared to 59.6% at December 31, 2004. In 2005, rising short-term interest rates, our pricing strategy and increased competition for certificate accounts has resulted in a large shift of deposits out of the core deposit category into short to intermediate term certificates. We expect this shift out of lower costing deposits will continue in 2006 and further pressure our net interest margin. The following table sets forth the composition of deposits by type at the dates indicated and the change in the dollar amount of our deposits for the periods shown: At or For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2005 At or For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2004 At or For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Amount % ofDeposits Increase(Decrease) Amount % ofDeposits Increase(Decrease) Amount % ofDeposits (Dollars in thousands) Commercial checking $ 258,632 4.2 % $ 19,383 $ 239,249 4.0 % $ 22,760 $ 216,489 3.9 % Non-interest bearing checking 291,462 4.7 40,893 250,569 4.2 32,123 218,446 3.9 Interest-bearing checking 816,387 13.2 (155,622 ) 972,009 16.4 416,334 555,675 10.0 Commercial money markets 60,064 1.0 (4,746 ) 64,810 1.1 45,298 19,512 .3 Money markets 615,280 9.9 3,773 611,507 10.3 (273,709 ) 885,216 15.9 Passbooks 1,268,680 20.4 (130,419 ) 1,399,099 23.6 45,218 1,353,881 24.2 Total core deposits 3,310,505 53.4 (226,738 ) 3,537,243 59.6 288,024 3,249,219 58.2 Certificates of deposit 2,885,998 46.6 490,393 2,395,605 40.4 71,880 2,323,725 41.7 Unamortized premium 1,000 0.0 (1,860 ) 2,860  (4,651 ) 7,511 .1 Total deposits $ 6,197,503 100.0 % $ 261,795 $ 5,935,708 100.0 % $ 355,253 $ 5,580,455 100.0 % 15 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the distribution and the weighted-average nominal interest rates of our average deposits for the years indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 AverageBalance Percentof TotalDeposits WeightedAverageNominalRate AverageBalance Percentof TotalDeposits WeightedAverageNominalRate AverageBalance Percentof TotalDeposits WeightedAverageNominalRate (Dollars in thousands) Commercial checking $ 266,948 4.40 %  % $ 236,300 4.15 %  % $ 167,743 4.07 %  % Non-interest bearing checking 257,524 4.24  226,661 3.98  161,400 3.91  Interest-bearing checking 860,332 14.17 0.93 824,603 14.49 .84 410,261 9.95 .59 Money markets 656,092 10.81 1.77 690,950 12.14 .76 494,676 12.00 1.06 Commercial money markets 75,911 1.25 2.39 72,062 1.27 1.13 20,151 .49 1.36 Passbooks 1,347,958 22.21 0.58 1,364,904 24.00 .58 1,144,729 27.76 .81 Total checking, money market and passbook accounts 3,464,765 57.08 0.85 3,415,480 60.03 .62 2,398,960 58.18 .72 Certificates with original maturities of: 6 months or less 419,368 6.91 2.49 406,613 7.15 1.25 383,347 9.30 1.20 7 to 12 months 830,933 13.69 3.13 730,816 12.85 2.26 380,965 9.24 2.49 Greater than 1 to 3 years 1,159,786 19.11 2.98 956,551 16.81 2.41 784,688 19.03 2.75 Greater than 3 years 195,083 3.21 4.19 179,802 3.16 4.36 175,126 4.25 4.61 Total certificates of deposits 2,605,170 42.92 3.04 2,273,782 39.97 2.31 1,724,126 41.82 2.54 Total average deposits $ 6,069,935 100.00 % 1.79 % $ 5,689,262 100.00 % 1.29 % $ 4,123,086 100.00 % 1.48 % The following table presents, by various interest rate categories, the amount of our certificates of deposit outstanding at December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, and the periods to maturity of the certificates of deposit outstanding at December 31, 2005: At December 31, Time to Maturity at December 31, 2005 2005 2004 2003 WithinOne Year 1 to 3Years Over 3Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Certificates of deposit: Up to 1.99% $ 6,498 653,304 1,056,024 6,094 351 53 6,498 2.00% to 2.99% 484,714 1,100,135 479,922 450,001 34,374 339 484,714 3.00% to 3.99% 1,505,743 394,822 433,245 1,142,449 320,754 42,540 1,505,743 4.00% and greater 889,043 247,344 354,534 594,212 248,055 46,776 889,043 Total $ 2,885,998 2,395,605 2,323,725 2,192,756 603,534 89,708 2,885,998 At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding $751.1 million in certificate of deposit accounts in amounts of $100,000 or more maturing as follows: Period to Maturity Amount (Dollars in thousands) Three months or less $ 222,193 Over three through six months 123,480 Over six through 12 months 244,270 Over 12 months 161,124 Total $ 751,067 Borrowed Funds and Junior Subordinated Debentures Although deposits are our primary source of funds, we also utilize borrowings, such as advances from FHLB of Chicago, reverse repurchase agreements, when they are a less costly source of funds than retail deposits or when we have opportunities to reinvest borrowed funds at a positive rate of return, and to a lesser extent bank borrowings. Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago Advances. We obtain advances from the FHLB of Chicago secured by its capital stock investment in the FHLB of Chicago and a blanket pledge of certain of its mortgage loans. See Regulation and SupervisionFederal Home Loan Bank System. Such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. The maximum amount that the FHLB of Chicago will advance to member institutions, including the Bank, for purposes other than meeting withdrawals, fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the FHLB of Chicago. The maximum amount of FHLB of Chicago advances to a member institution generally is reduced by secured borrowings from any other source. At December 31, 2005, the Banks FHLB of Chicago advances totaled $2.47 billion, or 23.6% of our total assets, compared to $2.19 billion, or 22.6% of total assets at December 31, 2004. 16 Table of Contents Included in FHLB of Chicago advances at December 31, 2005 are $240.0 million of fixed-rate advances with original scheduled maturities of 5 to 10 years with interest rates ranging from 2.77% to 5.64%, which are putable at the discretion of the FHLB of Chicago within the next twelve months. At inception, we receive a lower cost of borrowing on such advances than on similar termed non-putable advances, in return for granting the FHLB of Chicago the option to put the advances prior to their final maturity. If put, the FHLB of Chicago will provide replacement funding, should we want or need to refinance the borrowing, at the then prevailing market rate of interest for the remaining term to maturity of the advances, subject to standard terms and conditions. Of the putable FHLB advances we had outstanding at December 31, 2005, we expect $75.0 million (with an average rate of 2.94%) will be put back to us in 2006. Unsecured Term Bank Loan and Line of Credit. In conjunction with the acquisition of EFC Bancorp, Inc. we refinanced the unsecured term bank loan and revolving line of credit that we maintain from an unaffiliated lender at our holding company. We increased our unsecured term bank loan from $63.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2005, to $115.0 million and increased our line of credit from $55.0 million to $60.0 million. At December 31, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the line. The loan agreement provides for an interest rate on the term loan at our option of Prime minus .50% or one, two, three, six or twelve-month LIBOR plus 90 basis points. The term loan is unsecured and matures on December 31, 2015, with the first scheduled payment of principal due on December 31, 2006, and annually thereafter. Prepayments of principal are allowed without penalty at the end of any repricing period. The revolving line of credit is also unsecured, bears an interest rate at our option at Prime minus .50% or one, two, three, six or twelve-month LIBOR plus 80 basis points and matures on January 31, 2007. The credit agreement for both the unsecured term loan and the secured revolving line of credit contains covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain a minimum stockholders equity balance and to obtain certain minimum operating results, as well as requiring the Bank to maintain well capitalized regulatory capital levels and certain non-performing asset ratios. In addition, the Company has agreed to certain restrictions on additional indebtedness and agreed not to pledge any stock of the Bank or MAF Developments for any purpose. Reverse Repurchase Agreements. We enter into sales of securities under agreements to repurchase the identical securities (reverse repurchase agreements) with nationally recognized primary securities dealers. These reverse repurchase agreements are treated as financings and are reflected on our balance sheet as other borrowings. The securities underlying the agreements are delivered to the dealers who arrange the transaction and continue to be reflected as assets on our balance sheet. The usual terms of these agreements require us, generally after a short period of time, to repurchase the same securities at a predetermined price or yield. In conjunction with the St. Francis acquisition in 2003, we assumed $105.0 million of reverse repurchase agreements. The following table presents certain information regarding reverse repurchase agreements as of the end of and for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Balance at end of period $ 500,000 $ 300,000 $ 105,000 Maximum month-end balance 500,000 300,000 105,000 Average balance 394,931 195,492 105,000 Weighted average rate at end of period 4.24 % 2.42 % 1.64 % Weighted average rate on average balance 3.41 1.69 1.64 At December 31, 2005, all reverse repurchase agreements were floating rate and have maturities ranging from three months to five years. The interest rate on $250.0 million of these agreements is tied to Prime and ranges from Prime minus 275 basis points to Prime minus 280 basis points. The remaining $250.0 million have interest rates ranging from three-month LIBOR minus 50 basis points to three-month LIBOR minus 114 basis points. The LIBOR indexed repurchase agreements are putable at the discretion of the lender quarterly in 2006 and are currently expected to be put which may require us to refinance these borrowings if we do not have sufficient cash on hand to repay at their put. At December 31, 2005, reverse repurchase agreements were collateralized by investment and collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) securities with a carrying value of $542.4 million and a market value of $531.0 million. We intend to continue to use reverse repurchase agreements as an additional funding source. 17 Table of Contents Retail Repurchase Agreements. For certain customers with significant funds available for deposit at the Bank, we offer retail repurchase agreements under which we collateralize our obligation to repay the customer funds with U.S. government or agency securities. The retail repurchases, which totaled $22.4 million at December 31, 2005, are collateralized by three U.S. government agency and three CMO securities with a carrying and fair value of $30.0 million. Junior Subordinated Debentures. During 2005, the Company issued $67.0 million of junior subordinated debentures through two privately offered trust preferred financings. This debt, which matures in 30 years and is callable at par after five years, provides an attractive alternative to equity capital. Interest on the junior subordinated debentures is payable quarterly at a floating rate tied to three-month LIBOR. At December 31, 2005, the interest rate for $30.9 million of the debentures was 6.24% and for $36.1 million was 5.89%. The following table is a summary of the Companys borrowed funds and junior subordinated debentures at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The weighted average rates are contractual rates and are not adjusted for purchase accounting adjustments. The unamortized premium was recorded in 2003 as a result of purchase accounting adjustments for the acquisitions of Fidelity and St. Francis in 2003. At December 31, 2005, the effective borrowing costs, including amortization of the premium, were 4.28% compared to 3.70% at December 31, 2004.

We started this business in 1974 and since that time have developed and sold over 6,500 lots in 24 different subdivisions primarily in the western suburbs of Chicago. MAFD typically acts as sole principal or as a joint venture partner in our development projects. Historically, we have provided essentially all of the capital for a joint venture and receive in exchange an ownership interest in the joint venture which entitles us to a market rate of return on invested capital plus a percentage of the profit or loss generated by the project, generally 50-60%, with the exact percentage based upon a number of factors, including characteristics of the venture, the perceived risks involved, and the time to completion. In addition, MAFD may from time to time invest in residential real estate projects, either individually or structured as limited partnership investments, managed by unaffiliated parties. 18 Table of Contents At December 31, 2005 Description of Project Numberof LotsSold toDate Numberof LotSalesPending LotsRemainingFor Sale(1) InvestmentBalance (Dollars in thousands) Springbank of Plainfield 1,599 residential lots; 281 multi-family units and 45.8 acres for commercial development 123 85 1,476 $ 49,850 Shenandoah 326 residential lots 326    Tallgrass of Naperville 952 residential lots; 19.3 acres for multi-family homes; 12.8 acres for commercial development(2) 949  3 216 $ 50,066 (1) Lots remaining for sale reflects planned single-family lots in the current project that have not yet been sold and does not include commercial or multi-family units.

Delayed receipt of local zoning and plan approvals in 2004 and 2005 delayed the original timeline of future lot sale closings by approximately twelve months. Based on the current plans for this project, future developments costs (including the remaining land acquisition costs) are currently estimated to be $96 million. The investment balance shown in the table above includes land purchases, engineering, survey and other preliminary development costs related to lots that have not been sold. Development of this project is currently expected to continue over the next four to six years. Fully Developed Projects: Shenandoah. The final lots were sold during 2005. Tallgrass of Naperville. The three remaining lots were sold and closed in the first quarter of 2006. Regulation and Supervision General. The Company, as a savings and loan holding company, is required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of, the OTS under the Home Owners Loan Act , or the HOLA. In addition, the activities of savings institutions, like us, are governed by the HOLA and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or the FDI Act. We are subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OTS, as our primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as the deposit insurer. We are a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank, or FHLB, System and our deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Savings Association Insurance Fund, or SAIF, managed by the FDIC. We must file reports with the OTS and the FDIC concerning our activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other savings institutions. The OTS and/or the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to test our compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the OTS, the FDIC or the Congress, could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Certain regulatory requirements applicable to us are referred to below or elsewhere herein. The description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to savings institutions and their holding companies set forth in this Form 10-K does not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on our business. 19 Table of Contents Holding Company Regulation. The Company is a non-diversified unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the HOLA. As a unitary savings and loan holding company, the Company generally will not be restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may engage, provided that we continue to be a qualified thrift lender, or QTL. See Federal Savings Institution RegulationQTL Test. Upon any non-supervisory acquisition by the Company of another savings institution or savings bank that meets the QTL test and is deemed to be a savings institution by the OTS, the Company would become a multiple savings and loan holding company (if the acquired institution is held as a separate subsidiary) and would be subject to limitations on the types of business activities in which it could engage. The HOLA limits the activities of a multiple savings and loan holding company and its uninsured institution subsidiaries primarily to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the BHC Act, subject to the prior approval of the OTS, and activities authorized by OTS regulation. No multiple savings and loan holding company may acquire more than 5% of the voting stock of a company engaged in impermissible activities. The HOLA prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the OTS; or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the OTS must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved the effect of the acquisition on the institution, the risk to the insurance funds, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. Although savings and loan holding companies are not subject to specific capital requirements or specific restrictions on the payment of dividends or other capital distributions, HOLA does prescribe such restrictions on subsidiary savings institutions, as described below. We must notify the OTS 30 days before declaring any dividend to the Company. In addition, the financial impact of a holding company on its subsidiary institution is a matter that is evaluated by the OTS and the agency has authority to order cessation of activities or divestiture of uninsured subsidiaries deemed to pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the institution. Federal Savings Institution Regulation Capital Requirements. The OTS capital regulations require savings institutions to meet three minimum capital standards: a 1.5% tangible capital ratio, a 3% leverage (core capital) ratio for institutions receiving the highest rating on the CAMEL financial institution rating system, and a 4% leverage (core capital) ratio for all other institutions, like the Bank, and an 8% risk-based capital ratio. In addition, the prompt corrective action standards discussed below also establish, in effect, a minimum 2% tangible capital standard, a 4% leverage (core capital) ratio (3% for institutions receiving the highest rating on the CAMEL financial institution rating system), and, together with the risk-based capital standard itself, a 4% Tier I risk-based capital standard. The OTS regulations also require that, in meeting the leverage ratio, tangible and risk-based capital standards, institutions must generally deduct investments in and loans to subsidiaries engaged in activities as principal that are not permissible for a national bank. The risk-based capital standard for savings institutions requires the maintenance of Tier I (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 4% and 8%, respectively. 20 Table of Contents At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Bank was in compliance with the current capital requirements as follows: At December 31, 2005 At December 31, 2004 Amount Percent ofAssets Amount Percent ofAssets (Dollars in thousands) Stockholders equity of the Bank $ 1,012,304 9.72 % $ 983,865 10.22 % Tangible capital of the Bank $ 715,105 7.07 $ 664,449 7.14 Tangible capital requirement 151,807 1.50 139,642 1.50 Excess $ 563,298 5.57 % $ 524,807 5.64 % Core capital of the Bank $ 715,105 7.07 $ 664,449 7.14 Core capital requirement 404,818 4.00 372,379 4.00 Excess $ 310,287 3.07 % $ 292,070 3.14 % Core and supplementary capital of the Bank $ 735,996 11.15 $ 687,500 11.30 Risk based capital requirement 528,112 8.00 486,665 8.00 Excess $ 207,884 3.15 % $ 200,835 3.30 % Total Bank assets $ 10,417,886 $ 9,629,108 Adjusted total Bank assets 10,120,457 9,309,466 Total risk weighted Bank assets 6,898,826 6,402,954 Adjusted total risk weighted Bank assets 6,601,398 6,083,312 The following table reflects the adjustments required to reconcile the Banks stockholders equity to the Banks regulatory capital at December 31, 2005: Tangible Core Risk-Based (Dollars in thousands) Stockholders equity of the Bank $ 1,012,304 $ 1,012,304 $ 1,012,304 Goodwill and core deposit intangibles (314,414 ) (314,414 ) (314,414 ) Non-permissible subsidiary deduction (395 ) (395 ) (395 ) Non-includible purchased mortgage servicing rights (2,001 ) (2,001 ) (2,001 ) Adjustment for available for sale securities 19,611 19,611 19,611 Recourse on loan sales   (15,604 ) General allowance for loan losses   36,495 Regulatory capital of the Bank $ 715,105 $ 715,105 $ 735,996 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Under the OTS prompt corrective action regulations, the OTS is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institutions degree of undercapitalization. Generally, a savings institution is considered well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 10%, its ratio of Tier I (core) capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 6%, its ratio of core capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the OTS to meet a specific capital level. A savings institution generally is considered adequately capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 8%, its ratio of Tier I (core) capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 4%, and its ratio of core capital to total assets is at least 4% (3% if the institution receives the highest CAMEL rating). A savings institution that has a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of less than 8%, a ratio of Tier I (core) capital to risk-weighted assets of less than 4% or a ratio of core capital to total assets of less than 4% (3% or less for institutions with the highest examination rating) is considered to be undercapitalized. A savings institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3% is considered to be significantly undercapitalized, and a savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2% is deemed to be critically undercapitalized. Subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. The regulation also provides that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OTS within 45 days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. Compliance with the plan must be guaranteed by any parent holding company. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, investment activities, capital distributions and expansion. The OTS could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 21 Table of Contents Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based deposit insurance system that assesses deposit insurance premiums according to the level of risk involved in an institutions activities. An institutions risk category is based upon whether the institution is classified as well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized and one of three supervisory subcategories within each capital group. The supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned is based on a supervisory evaluation and information which the FDIC determines to be relevant to the institutions financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund. Based on its capital and supervisory subgroups, each Bank Insurance Fund, or BIF, and SAIF member institution is assigned an annual FDIC assessment rate, with an institution in the highest category (i.e., well-capitalized and healthy) receiving the lowest rates and an institution in the lowest category (i.e., undercapitalized and posing substantial supervisory concern) receiving the highest rates. The FDIC has authority to further raise premiums if deemed necessary. If such action is taken, it could have an adverse effect on our earnings of the Bank. The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996, or the Funds Act, imposed a special one-time assessment on SAIF members, including the Bank, to recapitalize the SAIF. The SAIF was undercapitalized due primarily to a statutory requirement that SAIF members make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, to recapitalize the predecessor to SAIF. The Funds Act spreads the obligations for payment of the FICO bonds across all SAIF and BIF members. As of the first quarter of 2006, BIF and SAIF deposits will be assessed a FICO payment of 1.32 basis points of deposits. As a result of the Funds Act and the FDI Act, the FDIC voted to effectively lower SAIF assessments in a range of 0 to 27 basis points as of January 1, 1997. Our assessment rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was the lowest available to well-capitalized financial institutions. A significant increase in SAIF insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of our operations. Under the FDI Act, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the OTS. Our management does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. In February 2006, comprehensive legislation reforming the deposit insurance system was enacted. Under this legislation, BIF and SAIF will be merged into a single deposit insurance fund, or DIF, increases the deposit insurance coverage limits for retirements accounts and indexes future coverage limitations, among other changes. Most significantly, the legislation could allow the FDIC to raise or lower the designated reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.50% on an annual basis. It also authorizes certain one-time premium assessment credits, awards DIF dividends under certain circumstances, and requires certain changes in the calculation methodology. Since the implementation of this legislation requires FDIC rulemaking, which is not required to be complete until November 2006, it is uncertain what, if any, impact this legislation will have on our operations. Community Reinvestment. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or the CRA, every insured depository institution, including the Bank, has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, or limit an institutions discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community that are consistent with the CRA. Institutions are rated on their performance in meeting the needs of their communities. Performance is tested in three areas: (a) lending, which evaluates the institutions record of making loans in its assessment areas; (b) investment, which evaluates the institutions record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing and programs benefiting low- or moderate-income individuals and businesses; and (c) service, which evaluates the institutions delivery of services to residents of its communities through its branches, ATMs and other offices. The CRA requires each federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a financial institution, to assess and assign one of four ratings to the institutions record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take this record into account in evaluating certain applications by the institution, including applications for charters, branches and other deposit facilities, relocations, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities, and savings and loan holding company acquisitions. The CRA also requires that all institutions publicly disclose their CRA 22 Table of Contents ratings. The Bank received an outstanding rating on its CRA performance evaluation prepared by the OTS dated July 18, 2005, the most recent report we have received. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or the GLB Act, significantly reformed various aspects of the financial services business, including, but not limited to: (i) the establishment of a new framework under which bank holding companies and, subject to numerous restrictions, banks can own securities firms, insurance companies and other financial companies; (ii) subjecting banks to the same securities regulation as other providers of securities products; and (iii) prohibiting new unitary savings and loan holding companies from engaging in nonfinancial activities or affiliating with nonfinancial entities. The provisions in the GLB Act permitting full affiliations between bank holding companies or banks and other financial companies do not increase the Companys authority to affiliate with securities firms, insurance companies or other financial companies. As a unitary savings and loan holding company, the Company was generally permitted to have such affiliations prior to the enactment of the GLB Act. It is expected, however, that these provisions will benefit the Companys competitors. The prohibition on the ability of new unitary savings and loan holding companies to engage in nonfinancial activities or affiliating with nonfinancial entities generally applies only to savings and loan holding companies that were not, or had not submitted an application to become, savings and loan holding companies as of May 4, 1999. Since the Company was treated as a unitary savings and loan holding company prior to that date, the GLB Act will not prohibit the Company from engaging in nonfinancial activities or acquiring nonfinancial subsidiaries. However, the GLB Act generally restricts any nonfinancial entity from acquiring the Company unless such nonfinancial entity was, or had submitted an application to become a savings and loan holding company as of May 4, 1999. The GLB Act imposed new requirements on financial institutions with respect to customer privacy by generally prohibiting disclosure of customer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the customer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually. The Company has developed policies and procedures to comply with the implementing regulations promulgated by the OTS and the other federal regulators with regard to customer privacy. To the extent the GLB Act permits banks, securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate, the financial services industry may experience further consolidation. This could result in a growing number of larger financial institutions that offer a wider variety of financial services than the Company currently offers and that can aggressively compete in the markets the Company currently serves. Bank Secrecy Act. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions involving more than $10,000 to the United States Treasury. In addition, a financial institution is required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve $5,000 or more and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect the transaction involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The USA Patriot Act of 2001, enacted in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, requires bank regulators to consider a financial institutions compliance with the BSA when reviewing applications from financial institutions. Loans to One Borrower. Under the HOLA, savings institutions are generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower applicable to national banks. Generally, savings institutions may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if such loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which is defined to include certain financial instruments and bullion. At December 31, 2005, our legal lending limit on loans to any one borrower was $110.5 million. At December 31, 2005, the Banks largest amount of loans to any one related borrower group was $74.0 million. QTL Test. The HOLA requires savings institutions to meet a QTL test. Under the QTL test, a savings and loan association is required to either qualify as a domestic building and loan association under the Internal Revenue Code or maintain at least 65% of its portfolio assets (total assets less (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangibles, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain qualified thrift investments (primarily residential 23 Table of Contents mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities) in at least 9 months out of each 12 month period. A savings institution that fails the QTL test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a bank charter. As of December 31, 2005, the Bank maintained 85.6% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and, therefore, met the QTL test. Limitation on Capital Distributions. OTS regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by a savings institution, such as cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash out merger and other distributions charged against capital, if the institution would not be well-capitalized after the distribution. The regulations provide that an institution (i) which is not eligible for expedited treatment under the application processing rules of the OTS; or (ii) for which its total amount of capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceeds its net income for that year to date plus its retained income for the preceding two years; or (iii) which would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution; or (iv) which would violate a prohibition contained in a statute, regulation or agreement between the institution and the OTS by performing the capital distribution, must submit an application to the OTS to receive approval of the capital distribution. Under any other circumstances, the Bank would be required to provide a written notice to the OTS 30 days prior to the capital distribution. Assessments. Savings institutions are required to pay assessments to the OTS to fund the agencys operations. The general assessment, paid on a semi-annual basis, is computed upon the savings institutions total assets, including consolidated subsidiaries, as reported in the Banks latest quarterly thrift financial report. The assessments paid by the Bank were $1.5 million, $1.3 million and $1.0 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Branching. OTS regulations permit nationwide branching by federally chartered savings institutions to the extent allowed by federal statute. Generally, a federal savings institution which meets the QTL test, may establish or acquire branches in states other than its home state. This permits federal savings institutions to establish interstate networks and to geographically diversify their loan portfolios and lines of business. The OTS authority preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings institutions. Transactions with Related Parties. The Banks authority to engage in transactions with related parties or affiliates (e.g., any company that controls or is under common control with an institution, including the Company and its non-savings institution subsidiaries) is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, or FRA. Section 23A limits the aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings institutions capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in Section 23A, and the purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Section 23B generally provides that certain transactions with affiliates, including loans and asset purchases, must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. The Banks authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders, as well as entities such persons control, is governed by Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and Regulation O thereunder. Among other things, such loans are generally required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and to not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. Regulation O also places individual and aggregate limits on the amount of loans the Bank may make to such persons based, in part, on the Banks capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed. Enforcement. Under the FDI Act, the OTS has primary enforcement responsibility over savings institutions and has the authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution affiliated parties, including certain shareholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors to institution of proceedings for receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and may amount to as 24 Table of Contents much as $1 million per day in certain circumstances. Under the FDI Act, the FDIC has the authority to recommend to the Director of the OTS enforcement action to be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If action is not taken by the Director, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations. Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking agencies have adopted Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness, or the Guidelines, and a final rule to implement safety and soundness standards required under the FDI Act. The Guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The standards set forth in the Guidelines address internal controls and information systems; internal audit system; credit underwriting; loan documentation; interest rate risk exposure; asset growth; asset quality; earnings and compensation; fees and benefits. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the Guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard, as required by the FDI Act. The OTS requires that a savings association file a written safety and soundness compliance plan within 30 days of receiving a request for a compliance plan from the OTS. Consumer Lending Laws. Our subsidiaries also are subject to many federal and state consumer protection statutes and regulations including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Among other things, these acts:  require lenders to disclose credit terms in meaningful and consistent ways;  prohibit discrimination against an applicant in any consumer or business credit transaction;  prohibit discrimination in housing-related lending activities;  require certain lenders to collect and report applicant and borrower data regarding loans for home purchases or improvement projects;  require lenders to provide borrowers with information regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements;  prohibit certain lending practices and limit escrow account amounts with respect to real estate transactions; and  prescribe possible penalties for violations of the requirements of consumer protection statutes and regulations. Federal Fair Lending Laws. The federal fair lending laws prohibit discriminatory lending practices. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits discrimination against an applicant in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. Under the Fair Housing Act, it is unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status. Among other things, these laws prohibit a lender from denying or discouraging credit on a discriminatory basis, making excessively low appraisals of property based on racial considerations, or charging excessive rates or imposing more stringent loan terms or conditions on a discriminatory basis. In addition to private actions by aggrieved borrowers or applicants for actual and punitive damages, the U.S. Department of Justice and other regulatory agencies can take enforcement action seeking injunctive and other equitable relief for alleged violations. The Bank is subject to an Agreed Consent Order that it entered into on December 30, 2002, to resolve allegations by the Department of Justice that the Bank had violated the fair lending laws based on the level of the Banks lending in minority areas during the period 1996-2000. The Bank denied all alleged violations. The Agreed Consent Order required the Bank to undertake a number of actions over the five year period of 2003-2008 to promote its home mortgage lending in communities with significant minority populations, including:  Open or acquire two branch offices in minority areas within 30 months. 25 Table of Contents  Implement a targeted advertising campaign to increase home mortgage lending.  Provide $10 million in benefits to borrowers under special lending programs to help residents of minority areas achieve home ownership (which may include subsidized interest rates, down payment and closing cost assistance, and Prime rate loans to borrowers with below Prime credit).  Contribute $500,000 over the five year period 2003-2008 to homebuyer education and counseling programs, and conduct an assessment of the home mortgage credit needs of residents in minority areas. The Bank is in compliance with all terms of the Order. Since the Order was entered by the court, the Bank has opened two branch offices within minority areas, conducted an assessment of home mortgage credit needs of residents in minority areas, and implemented a targeted marketing campaign to increase mortgage lending. The Bank fully satisfied the $10 million financial benefits requirement in 2003 through special lending programs designed to help minority residents achieve homeownership and is continuing to offer special community lending programs targeted to minority and low-income borrowers in its market areas. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. The federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or HMDA, grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods. One purpose of the HMDA is to provide public information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located. The HMDA also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes. The HMDA requires institutions to report data regarding applications for loans for the purchase or improvement of one- to four-family and multi-family dwellings, as well as information concerning originations and purchases of such loans. Federal bank regulators rely, in part, upon data provided under the HMDA to determine whether depository institutions engage in discriminatory lending practices. The appropriate federal banking agency, or in some cases, HUD, enforces compliance with the HMDA and implements its regulations. Administrative sanctions, including civil money penalties, may be imposed by supervisory agencies for violations of this act. Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. The federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA, requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements. RESPA also prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts. Violations of RESPA may result in imposition of penalties, including: (1) civil liability equal to three times the amount of any charge paid for the settlement services or civil liability of up to $1,000 per claimant, depending on the violation; (2) awards of court costs and attorneys fees; and (3) fines of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. Truth in Lending Act. The federal Truth in Lending Act is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably. As result of the act, all creditors must use the same credit terminology and expressions of rates, and disclose the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule for each proposed loan. Violations of the Truth in Lending Act may result in regulatory sanctions and in the imposition of both civil and, in the case of willful violations, criminal penalties. Under certain circumstances, the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z of FRA also provide a consumer with a right of rescission, which if exercised would require the creditor to reimburse any amount paid by the consumer to the creditor or to a third party in connection with the offending transaction, including finance charges, application fees, commitment fees, title search fees and appraisal fees. Consumers may also seek actual and punitive damages for violations of the Truth in Lending Act. Federal Home Loan Bank System The Bank is a member of the FHLB system, which consists of 12 regional FHLBs. The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. The Bank, as a member of the FHLB of Chicago, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of Chicago in an amount at 26 Table of Contents least equal to 1% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, or 1/20 of its advances (borrowings) from the FHLB of Chicago, whichever is greater. At December 31, 2005, the Bank had advances from the FHLB of Chicago with aggregate outstanding principal balances of $2.47 billion, and the Banks investment in FHLB of Chicago stock of $165.7 million was $42.1 million in excess of its minimum requirement. FHLB of Chicago advances must be secured by specified types of collateral and are available to member institutions primarily for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance. FHLB of Chicago also purchases mortgages in the secondary market through its MPF program. The Bank has sold loans to MPF since 1998. See discussion on page 7 under Secondary Market and Loan Servicing Activities. Regulatory directives, capital requirements and net income of the FHLB of Chicago affect its ability to pay dividends to us. In addition, the FHLBs are required to provide funds to cover certain obligations on bonds issued by the Resolution Funding Corporation to fund the resolution of insolvent thrifts and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the FHLBs pay to their members and could also result in the FHLBs imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. The regulator of the FHLB system recently announced proposed regulations that would increase the capital requirements of the FHLB of Chicago and could limit their dividend payout to us and impact their ability to redeem stock. The FHLB of Chicago suspended stock redemptions in the second half of 2005 and has not yet resumed redemptions. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, we received stock dividends paid by the FHLB of Chicago in the amount of $12.3 million, $23.1 million and $14.4 million, respectively, based on the Banks investment in FHLB of Chicago stock which has varied over time. From an average of 6.125% paid in 2004 the FHLB of Chicago has reduced its dividend to 3.0% for the fourth quarter of 2005. Allen H. Koranda, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, served on the 16-member Board of Directors of the FHLB of Chicago from 1997 through 2005. Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve Board regulations require savings institutions to maintain non-interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily checking accounts). The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for accounts aggregating $48.3 million or less (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3%; and for accounts greater than $48.3 million, the reserve requirement is currently $1,449,000 plus 10% (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board) against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of $48.3 million. The first $7.8 million of otherwise reserveable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. The Bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the OTS. 27 Table of Contents Executive Officers of the Registrant Information regarding the executive officers of the Company and the Bank are listed below.

Risk Factors The Company is subject to certain risks. In addition to the factors discussed below, please see the discussion under Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk beginning on page 1. These risks and uncertainties, along with the other information in our Form 10-K, should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. We operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision, its chartering authority, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of its deposits. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and are not intended to protect the interests of investors in our common stock. Regulatory authorities have broad discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the authority to impose restrictions on our operations, to classify our assets which may affect the level of our allowance for loan losses, to limit our dividends or impose higher capital requirements on us, to limit acquisition activities we may propose and to impose penalties for noncompliance. In addition, we are likely to continue to incur significant operational costs related to compliance as the risks and burden of regulatory compliance have increased significantly in recent years. Regulatory changes, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Unanticipated changes in interest rates could reduce our profitability and affect the value of our assets. Our net interest income, which is our primary source of revenue, depends on the spread between the interest we earn on loans and investments and the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings. For this reason, the level of our earnings is highly susceptible to changes in interest rates which generally impact our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities differently. While we actively manage this sensitivity to interest rate risk as a key part of our business strategy, unanticipated changes in interest rates and changes in the yield curve may have a material adverse affect on our results of operation. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate mortgage loans, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of loans. Competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our growth and profitability. The banking business is highly competitive and we experience competition in each of our markets from many other financial institutions. We compete with community banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, mortgage brokers, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other regional, super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our primary 29 Table of Contents market areas and elsewhere. While we believe we can and do successfully compete with these other financial institutions in our primary markets, we may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of lesser geographic diversification and inability to spread our marketing costs across a broader market. We compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in originating loans. A key part of our strategy is to compete by concentrating our marketing efforts in our primary markets with local advertisements, broad product offerings, community support, personal contacts, and flexibility and responsiveness in working with local customers, but competition has made it more difficult for us to grow our customer base without adjusting our pricing. In addition, in recent years we have encountered many de novo banks in our market areas that tend to price their loans and deposits aggressively in order to attract customers. Price competition for loans and deposits causes us to earn less on our loans and pay more on our deposits, which reduces net interest income. If the value of real estate in the suburban Chicago and suburban Milwaukee areas were to decline precipitously, a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on us. With most of our real estate loans concentrated in suburban Chicago and suburban Milwaukee areas, a decline in local economic conditions or the demand for real estate in these markets could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing our loans. A decline in property values could diminish our ability to recover fully on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral and we might suffer greater losses on defaulted loans as a result. A decline in local economic and market conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse. High loan-to-value ratios on a growing portion of our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios expose us to greater risk of loss. A growing number of our residential mortgage loans are secured by liens on mortgage properties in which the borrowers have little or no equity which may lead to a higher incidence of default on these loans. Some of our mortgage and home equity loans or lines of credit may have, either alone or when added to existing senior lien balances, a post-funding combined loan-to-value ratio of up to 100% of the value of the home securing the loan. At December 31, 2005, approximately $429.3 million, or 8%, of our $5.59 billion single-family residential mortgage loan portfolio, including equity loans, had original loan-to-value ratios in excess of 90% (based on total line available) and no private mortgage insurance. Depending on our loan sale activity and customer usage of undrawn equity lines, based on current origination trends we expect that the percent of our loan portfolio comprised of higher loan to value loans is likely to increase in 2006. We may experience a higher risk of loss on these loans since our ability to recover against the collateral is more sensitive to declining property values than for loans with lower combined loan-to-value ratios. Our ability to service our holding company debt and pay dividends to our shareholders is substantially dependent on dividends from the Bank, and these dividends are subject to regulatory limits. Since January 1, 2005, we have added an additional $112 million of debt at our holding company as part of our capital management strategy designed to increase shareholder returns. We are largely dependent on the receipt of dividends from Mid America Bank in order to service this debt and the availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. In the event that the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service our debt, fund additional real estate development activities, complete planned stock buybacks or pay dividends on our common stock. Our allowance for loan losses is based on our estimates of future losses inherent in our portfolio, and actual losses we incur could exceed these estimates. Like all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses we deem adequate to cover losses inherent in our portfolio from loans that may not be repaid in their entirety. In evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis, in addition to numerous quantitative factors we take into account, we also consider many qualitative factors, such as general business and economic conditions, general real estate market trends and other matters which are by their nature more subjective and susceptible to change. In addition, our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on 30 Table of Contents some of our commercial loans require us to assess our borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments, competitive challenges and other factors outside our control. Because of the degree of uncertainty in the assumptions we make and the factors we consider, the losses we actually incur may exceed our estimates and our allowance for loan losses may prove insufficient to absorb these losses. Income from our real estate development business has proven more volatile in recent periods than other sources of income. Historically, a significant source of our non-interest income has been income from our real estate development projects involving the acquisition and development of raw land into residential lots for sale to home builders. We often develop these projects in multiple phases over a period of years and must obtain municipal zoning, engineering and other approvals to proceed with our plans. We do not control the municipal process and may not be able to accurately predict the timing and cost involved, particularly in communities where the process may be less well established like we have encountered with our Springbank project in Plainfield, Illinois. Delays in the approval process, as well as potential weather-related or other delays outside our control, may prolong the project timeline and increase our development costs and may interfere with the planned marketing of lots in different units. While we believe our real estate development activities offer us opportunity for attractive return on the capital we invest in this business, delays have caused more volatility to our income from real estate development in 2004 and 2005 than in prior years when our projects were not as large. We are likely to continue to experience quarterly fluctuations in earnings in 2006 as we expect higher income from real estate development in the second half of the year based on current estimates of the timing of anticipated lot sale closings in our Springbank project. Our acquisition strategy exposes us to certain risks. We have acquired a number of other banking companies in recent years and we may pursue selective acquisitions of other financial institutions in the future. Acquisitions can present certain managerial and operational challenges. While we evaluate acquisition opportunities across a variety of parameters, including our assessment of the potential impact on our financial condition as well as our prospective financial performance, our results may suffer as a result of an acquisition if we are not effective in integrating the acquired operations into our business and converting data processing systems to our platform as planned, or if we fail to achieve anticipated cost savings or revenue enhancements. In addition, we anticipate that future acquisitions, if any, will likely be valued at a premium to book value and at a premium to current market value, which may result in book value per share dilution and possible short-term earnings per share dilution for our shareholders depending on the transaction structure and pricing. Breaches of our computer and network security may result in compromises of information which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We depend heavily in our daily operations on our automated information systems, networks and telecommunications systems which support the evaluation, acquisition, monitoring, collection and administration of our loan and deposit servicing portfolios, general accounting and other management controls. We also outsource some data and payment processing to third parties. While we have implemented extensive policies and procedures designed to limit the impact of system failures or disruptions as well as information security measures to safeguard these systems, if we or our vendors encounter technological difficulties or security breaches, our ability to accurately process and account for customer transactions and to protect customer personal information could be compromised, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a failure or interruption of these systems or a failure of data integrity could subject us to customer complaints, potential lawsuits or increased regulatory scrutiny and could damage our reputation, making it more difficult for us to compete successfully. 31 Table of Contents Item 1B.
