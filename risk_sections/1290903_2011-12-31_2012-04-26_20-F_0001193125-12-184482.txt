Limitation on Liability and Other Indemnification Matters Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a companys articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime.

(7) 13,748 ordinary share options vested and exercisable, 23,937 options vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.

At the time of grant, our board of directors or the compensation committee determines if we will settle the performance units in cash, stock or both. Performance units granted to our employees are settled in ordinary shares; performance units granted to our non-employee directors are settled upon vesting in cash in an amount equal to the number of the vested performance units multiplied by the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the applicable vesting date. The fair market value of the performance units is determined based upon the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares on the trading date immediately preceding the grant date for awards made under the 2004 Plan and the grant date, or if the grant date is not a trading day then the immediately preceding trading date, for awards made under the 2009 Plan. Our performance units are subject to service-based vesting where a specific period of continued employment must pass before the performance units are vested. The following table summarizes, as of March 31, 2012, the unvested and outstanding performance units granted under our equity compensation plans.
