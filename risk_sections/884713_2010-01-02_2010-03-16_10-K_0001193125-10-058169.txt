ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may be unable to compete successfully in the highly competitive beverage category. The markets for our products are extremely competitive. In comparison to the major national brand beverage manufacturers, we are a relatively small participant in the industry. We face competition from the national brand beverage manufacturers in all of our markets and from other retailer brand beverage manufacturers. If our competitors reduce their selling prices, increase the frequency of their promotional 10 Table of Contents activities in our core markets, enter into the production of private label products, or if our customers do not allocate adequate shelf space for the beverages we supply, we could experience a decline in our volumes, be forced to reduce pricing, forgo price increases required to off-set increased costs of raw materials and fuel, increase capital and other expenditures, or lose market share, any of which could adversely affect our profitability. We may not be able to respond successfully to consumer trends related to carbonated and non-carbonated beverages. Consumer trends with respect to the products we sell are subject to change. Consumers are seeking increased variety in their beverages, and there is a growing interest among the public regarding the ingredients in our products, the attributes of those ingredients and health and wellness issues generally. This interest has resulted in a decline in consumer demand for full-calorie CSDs and an increase in consumer demand for products associated with health and wellness, such as reduced-calorie CSDs, water, enhanced water, teas and certain other non-carbonated beverages. Consumer preferences may change due to a variety of other factors, including the aging of the general population, changes in social trends, the real or perceived impact that the manufacturing of our products has on the environment, changes in consumer demographics, changes in travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns, negative publicity resulting from regulatory action or litigation against companies in the industry, or a downturn in economic conditions. Any of these changes may reduce consumers demand for our products. There can be no assurance that we can develop innovative products that respond to consumer trends. Our failure to develop innovative products could put us at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Because a small number of customers account for a significant percentage of our sales, the loss of or reduction in sales to any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated in a small number of customers. Our customers include many large national and regional grocery, mass-merchandise, drugstore, wholesale and convenience store chains in our core markets of North America, United Kingdom and Mexico. Sales to Wal-Mart, our top customer in 2009, 2008 and 2007 accounted for 33.5%, 35.8% and 39.8%, respectively, of our total revenue. Sales to our top ten customers in 2009, 2008 and 2007 accounted for approximately 60%, 62% and 64%, respectively, of our total revenue. We expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future. On January 27, 2009, we received written notice from Wal-Mart stating that Wal-Mart was exercising its right to terminate, without cause, our Exclusive Supply Contract, effective on January 28, 2012. Pursuant to the terms of the Exclusive Supply Contract, we are the exclusive supplier to Wal-Mart of retailer brand CSDs in the U.S. The termination provision of the Exclusive Supply Contract provides for exclusivity to be phased out over a period of three years following notice of termination. Accordingly, we have the exclusive right to supply at least two-thirds of Wal-Marts total CSD volume in the U.S. during the first 12 months of the Notice Period, and we have the exclusive right to supply at least one-third of Wal-Marts total CSD volume in the U.S during the second 12 months of the Notice Period. Notwithstanding the termination of the Exclusive Supply Contract, we continue to supply Wal-Mart and its affiliated companies, under annual non-exclusive supply agreements, with a variety of products in the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom and Mexico, including CSDs, clear, still and sparkling flavored waters, juice-based products, bottled water, energy drinks and ready-to-drink teas. The loss of Wal-Mart or any significant customer, or customers that in the aggregate represent a significant portion of our revenue, or a material reduction in the amount of business we undertake with any such customer or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows. Furthermore, we could 11 Table of Contents be adversely affected if Wal-Mart or any significant customer reacts unfavorably to any pricing of our products or decides to de-emphasize or reduce their product offerings in the categories with which we supply them. At January 2, 2010, we had $74.8 million of customer relationships recorded as an intangible asset. The permanent loss of any customer included in the intangible asset would result in impairment in the value of the intangible asset or accelerated amortization and could lead to an impairment of fixed assets that were used to service that client. Our ingredients, packaging supplies and other costs are subject to price increases and we may be unable to effectively pass rising costs on to our customers. We bear the risk of changes in prices on the ingredient and packaging in our products. The majority of our ingredient and packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the prices they charge us based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce them. Aluminum for cans and ends, resin for PET bottles, preforms and caps and corn for HFCS are examples of these underlying commodities. In addition, the contracts for certain of our ingredient and packaging materials permit our suppliers to increase the costs they charge us based on increases in their cost of converting those underlying commodities into the materials that we purchase. In certain cases those increases are subject to negotiated limits and, in other cases, they are not. These changes in the prices that we pay for ingredient and packaging materials occur at times that vary by product and supplier, but are principally on a monthly or annual basis. We are at risk with respect to fluctuating aluminum prices. Simultaneously, because PET resin is not a traded commodity, no fixed price mechanism has been implemented, and we are accordingly also at risk with respect to changes in PET prices. HFCS has a history of volatile price changes. We typically purchase HFCS requirements for North America under 12 month contracts. We have entered into fixed price commitments for a majority of our HFCS requirements for 2010. We have also entered into fixed price commitments for a majority of our forecasted aluminum requirements for 2010 as well as a portion of our requirements for 2011. Accordingly, we bear the risk of fluctuations in the costs of these ingredient and packaging materials, including the underlying costs of the commodities used to manufacture them and, to some extent, the costs of converting those commodities into the materials we purchase. We currently do not use derivatives to manage this risk. If the cost of these ingredients or packaging materials increases, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through adjustments to the prices we charge. If we cannot pass on these increases to our customers on a timely basis, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we are able to pass these costs on to our customers through price increases, the impact those increased prices could have on our volumes is uncertain. Our beverage and concentrate production facilities use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate. Fluctuations in the price of fuel and other energy sources for which we have not locked in long-term pricing commitments or arrangements would affect our operating costs, which could impact our profitability. If we fail to manage our operations successfully, our business and financial results may be materially and adversely affected. In recent years, we have grown our business and beverage offerings primarily through the acquisition of other companies, development of new product lines and growth with key customers. We believe that opportunities exist to increase sales of beverages in our markets by leveraging existing customer relationships, obtaining new customers, exploring new channels of distribution, introducing new products or identifying appropriate acquisition or strategic alliance candidates. The success of this strategy dealing with acquisitions depends on our ability to manage and integrate acquisitions and alliances into our existing business. Furthermore, the businesses or product lines that we acquire or align with may not be integrated successfully into our business 12 Table of Contents or prove profitable. In addition to the foregoing factors, our ability to expand our business in foreign countries is also dependent on, and may be limited by, our ability to comply with the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we may operate, as well as changes in local government regulations and policies in such jurisdictions. If we fail to manage the geographic allocation of production capacity surrounding customer demand in North America, we may lose certain customer product volume or have to utilize co-packers to fulfill our customer capacity obligations, either of which could negatively impact our financial results. Our geographic diversity subjects us to the risk of currency fluctuations. We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and other currencies. Our operations outside of the U.S. accounted for 36.7% of our 2009 sales. Accordingly, currency fluctuations in respect of our outstanding non-U.S. dollar denominated net asset balances may affect our reported results and competitive position. Furthermore, our foreign operations purchase key ingredients and packaging supplies in U.S. dollars. This exposes them to additional foreign currency risk that can adversely affect our reported results. If we are unable to maintain relationships with our raw material suppliers, we may incur higher supply costs or be unable to deliver products to our customers. In addition to water, the principal raw materials required to produce our products are PET bottles, caps and preforms, aluminum cans and ends, labels, cartons and trays, concentrates and sweeteners. We typically enter into annual or multi-year supply arrangements with our key suppliers, meaning that our suppliers are obligated to continue to supply us with materials for one-year or multi-year periods, at the end of which we must either renegotiate the contracts with those suppliers or find alternative sources for supply. We rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key suppliers to support our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to either renegotiate contracts with these suppliers when they expire or, alternatively, if we are unable to renegotiate contracts with our key suppliers, there can be no assurance that we could replace them. We could also incur higher ingredient and packaging supply costs in renegotiating contracts with existing suppliers or replacing those suppliers, or we could experience temporary disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. With respect to some of our key packaging supplies, such as aluminum cans and ends, and some of our key ingredients, such as sweeteners, we have entered into long-term supply agreements, the remaining terms of which range from one to two years, and therefore we are assured of a supply of those key packaging supplies and ingredients for a longer period of time. CCS supplies aluminum cans and ends under a contract expiring on December 31, 2011. The contract provides that CCS will supply our entire aluminum can and end requirements worldwide, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the supply of specific ingredient and packaging materials could be adversely affected by many factors, including industry consolidation, energy shortages, governmental controls, labor disputes, natural disasters, transportation interruption, political instability, acts of war or terrorism and other factors. We have a significant amount of outstanding debt, which could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations. As of January 2, 2010, our total indebtedness was $271.0 million. This significant amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors, including:  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt;  increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs; 13 Table of Contents  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  limiting our ability to incur additional debt to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes;  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;  placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt as we are; and  limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities, such as acquisitions, as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock. To the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt. In addition, our asset based lending (ABL) facility contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt at subsidiaries that are not guarantors, incur liens, merge or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into agreements restricting our ability to incur liens or the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions. The ABL facility also requires us to comply with certain affirmative and financial covenants. For additional information about our ABL facility, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources. If we breach the covenants and conditions set out in our debt agreements, counterparties could require us to repay the debt or we could have to renegotiate the debt agreements, which could lead to higher fees or interest costs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our two most significant debt arrangements currently outstanding are the ABL facility and the 8.375% senior subordinated notes due in 2017 (the 2017 Notes). Events of default under the ABL facility include nonpayment, inaccuracy of representations and warranties (which include the occurrence of an event having a material adverse effect), violation of covenants, cross-default to other indebtedness, bankruptcy, material judgments, and a change of control of the Company. If we breach a covenant and such breach is not waived by the lenders, or an event occurs that would have a material adverse effect on us, we would have to renegotiate the ABL facility and we would expect to incur higher fees and interest rates, provided the lenders wish to renegotiate. If a breach occurs, the lenders could choose to terminate the ABL facility and accelerate the loan balance. Should the ABL facility become currently due, we may have to incur additional fees and higher interest costs to replace it. However, there is no certainty in todays financial markets that we would be able to replace the ABL facility on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The events of default in the indenture governing the 2017 Notes include, among others: (i) failure to pay interest after a 30-day grace period; (ii) failure to pay principal when due; (iii) breach of the change of control covenant (which would require us to offer to repurchase the 2017 Notes) or asset sale covenant; (iv) unsatisfied judgments or cross-default acceleration to other indebtedness in excess of $20.0 million; and (v) our insolvency or that of our restricted subsidiaries that are significant subsidiaries. If our cash from operations is not sufficient to enable us to reduce our debt as anticipated, our interest expense could be materially higher than anticipated and our financial performance could be adversely affected. If our cash from operations is not sufficient to meet our expenses, or fund our capital expenditures and debt service 14 Table of Contents obligations, we may be required to refinance our debt, sell assets, borrow additional money, or raise equity. For additional information about our ABL facility, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources. Our ability to generate cash to meet our expenses and debt service obligations and to otherwise reduce our debt as anticipated will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, legislative, regulatory and other factors, including potential changes in costs, pricing, the success of product and marketing innovation, pressure from competitors and other matters discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including this Risk Factors section). Many of these factors are beyond our control. Any factor that negatively affects our results of operations, including our cash flow, may also negatively affect our ability to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt. If we are unable to reduce our debt as anticipated, our interest expense could be materially higher than anticipated and our financial performance could be adversely affected. If we do not have enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to take actions such as amending our ABL facility or indenture governing the 2017 Notes, refinancing all or part of our existing debt, selling assets, incurring additional indebtedness or raising equity. We cannot assure you that we will be able, at any given time, to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us, or at all. A portion of our indebtedness is variable rate debt, and changes in interest rates could adversely affect us by causing us to incur higher interest costs with respect to such variable rate debt. Our ABL facility subjects us to interest rate risk. The interest rate and margin applicable to the ABL facility is variable, meaning that the rate at which we pay interest on amounts borrowed under the facility fluctuates with changes in interest rates and our debt leverage. Accordingly, with respect to any amounts from time to time outstanding under the ABL facility, we are exposed to changes in interest rates. We do not currently use derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. If we are unable to adequately manage our debt structure in response to changes in the market, our interest expense could increase, which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Our financial results may be negatively impacted by the recent global financial events. Recent global financial events have resulted in the consolidation, failure or near failure of a number of institutions in the banking, insurance and investment banking industries and have substantially reduced the ability of companies to obtain financing. These events have also adversely affected the stock market. These events could have a number of different effects on our business, including:  reduction in consumer spending, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume;  a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us or our vendors to timely supply materials, thus reducing our cash flow;  an increase in counterparty risk;  an increased likelihood that one or more members of our banking syndicate may be unable to honor its commitments under our ABL facility; and  restricted access to capital markets that may limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities, such as acquisitions. Other events or conditions may arise directly or indirectly from the global financial events that could negatively impact our business. 15 Table of Contents We may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring activities. During the last four years we have implemented, and plan to continue to implement, restructuring activities to support the implementation of key strategic initiatives designed to achieve long-term sustainable growth. These activities are intended to maximize our operating effectiveness and efficiency and to reduce our costs. We cannot be assured that we will achieve or sustain the targeted benefits under these programs or that the benefits, even if achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term growth expectations. In addition, the implementation of key elements of these activities, such as employee job reductions and plant closures, may have an adverse impact on our business, particularly in the near-term. Substantial disruption to production at our beverage concentrates or other beverage production facilities could occur. A disruption in production at our beverage concentrates production facility, which manufactures almost all of our concentrates, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers, bottlers or distributors. The disruption could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. Our success depends, in part, on our intellectual property, which we may be unable to protect. We possess certain intellectual property that is important to our business. This intellectual property includes trade secrets, in the form of the concentrate formulas for most of the beverages that we produce, and trademarks for the names of the beverages that we sell. While we own certain of the trademarks used to identify our beverages, other trademarks are used through licenses from third parties or by permission from our retailer brand customers. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. To protect this intellectual property, we rely principally on registration of trademarks, contractual responsibilities and restrictions in agreements (such as indemnification, nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements) with employees, consultants and customers, and on common law and statutory protections afforded to trademarks, trade secrets and proprietary know-how. In addition, we vigorously protect our intellectual property against infringements using any and all legal remedies available. Notwithstanding our efforts, we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including:  our competitors may independently develop intellectual property that is similar to or better than ours;  employees, consultants or customers may not abide by their contractual agreements and the cost of enforcing those agreements may be prohibitive, or those agreements may prove to be unenforceable or more limited than anticipated;  foreign intellectual property laws may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights; and  our intellectual property rights may be successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitive position would weaken and we could face significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. At January 2, 2010, we had $45.0 million of rights and $9.5 million of trademarks recorded as intangible assets. Occasionally, third parties may assert that we are, or may be, infringing on or misappropriating their intellectual property rights. In these cases, we intend to defend against claims or negotiate licenses when we consider these actions appropriate. Intellectual property cases are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. If we become involved in this type of litigation, it could consume significant resources and divert our attention from business operations. 16 Table of Contents If we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, we could incur significant damages, be enjoined from continuing to manufacture, market or use the affected product, or be required to obtain a license to continue manufacturing or using the affected product. A license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly, changing products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impracticable. Our products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated and we could be liable for injury, illness or death caused by consumption of our products. We have adopted various quality, environmental, health and safety standards. However, our products may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated. A failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers, distributors or suppliers. This could result in expensive production interruptions, recalls and liability claims. We may be liable to our customers if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. Moreover, negative publicity could be generated from false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls. Any of these failures or occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows. Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation. We are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. We evaluate these claims and proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. We may establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies. We base our assessments, estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates. Actual settlements, judgments or resolutions of these claims or proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance. For more information, see BusinessLegal Proceedings. Changes in the legal and regulatory environment in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our costs or reduce our revenues. As a producer of beverages, we must comply with various federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws relating to production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution, including, in the U.S., those of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and California Proposition 65. We are also subject to various federal, state, provincial, local and foreign environmental laws and workplace regulations. These laws and regulations include, in the U.S., the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Unfair Labor Standards Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act, laws governing equal employment opportunity, customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, laws relating to the maintenance of fuel storage tanks, laws relating to water consumption and treatment, and various other federal statutes and regulations. These laws and regulations may change as a result of political, economic, or social events. Such regulatory changes may include changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws and environmental laws, including laws relating to the regulation of water rights and treatment. Changes in laws, regulations or government policy and related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business, which may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities. Proposed taxes on CSDs and other drinks could have an adverse effect on our business. Federal, state, local and foreign governments have considered imposing taxes on soda and other sugary drinks. Any such taxes could negatively impact consumer demand for our products and have an adverse effect on our revenues. 17 Table of Contents We are not in compliance with the requirements of the Ontario Environmental Protection Act (OEPA) and, if the Ontario government seeks to enforce those requirements or implements modifications to them, we could be adversely affected. Certain regulations under the OEPA provide that a minimum percentage of a bottlers soft drink sales within specified areas in Ontario must be made in refillable containers. The penalty for non-compliance is a fine of $50,000 per day beginning when the first offense occurs and continuing until the first conviction, and then increasing to $100,000 per day for each subsequent conviction. These fines may be increased to equal the amount of monetary benefit acquired by the offender as a result of the commission of the offense. We, and we believe other industry participants, are currently not in compliance with the requirements of the OEPA. We do not expect to be in compliance with these regulations in the foreseeable future. Ontario is not enforcing the OEPA at this time, but if it chose to enforce the OEPA in the future, we could incur fines for non-compliance and the possible prohibition of sales of soft drinks in non-refillable containers in Ontario. We estimate that approximately 3% of our sales would be affected by the possible limitation on sales of soft drinks in non-refillable containers in Ontario if the Ontario Ministry of the Environment initiated an action to enforce the provisions of the OEPA against us. In April 2003, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment proposed to revoke these regulations in favor of new mechanisms under the Ontario Waste Diversion Act to enhance diversion from disposal of CSD containers. On December 22, 2003, the Ontario provincial government approved the implementation of the Blue Box Program plan under the Ministry of Environment Waste Diversion Act. The Program requires those parties who are brand owners or licensees of rights to brands which are manufactured, packaged or distributed for sale in Ontario to contribute to the net cost of the Blue Box Program. We generally manufacture, package and distribute products for and on behalf of third party customers. Therefore, we do not believe that we will be responsible for direct costs of the Program. However, our customers may attempt to pass these costs, or a portion of them, on to us. We do not believe that the costs for which we may ultimately be responsible under this Program will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, we cannot guarantee this outcome. The Blue Box Program does not revoke any of the regulations mentioned above under the OEPA regarding refillable containers, although the industry anticipates that they will be reversed in the future. Adverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products. The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may reduce the demand for our products and contribute to lower revenues, which could negatively impact our profitability. Global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and financial results. Our business can be affected by large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the U.S. or other major industrialized countries in which we do business, major natural disasters, or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases such as H1N1 influenza. Such events could impair our ability to manage our business could disrupt our supply of raw materials, and could impact production, transportation and delivery of products. In addition, such events could cause disruption of regional or global economic activity, which can affect consumers purchasing power in the affected areas and, therefore, reduce demand for our products. Our success depends in part upon our ability to recruit, retain and prepare succession plans for our CEO, CFO, senior management and key employees. The performance of our CEO, CFO, senior management and other key employees is critical to our success. We plan to continue to invest time and resources in developing our senior management and key employee teams. In 2009, we appointed a new CEO and a new CFO of the Company. Our long-term success will depend on 18 Table of Contents our ability to recruit and retain capable senior management and other key employees, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and financial condition. Further, if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our CEO, CFO, senior management and other key employees, our operating results could be adversely affected. Changes in future business conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill, indefinite life intangible assets or other intangible assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our results of operations. As part of our overall strategy, we will, from time to time, make investments in other businesses. These investments are made upon careful target analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise that adversely affect anticipated returns or that are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. Goodwill accounted for approximately $30.6 million of our recorded total assets as of January 2, 2010. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment and certain underlying assumptions. Our only intangible asset with an indefinite life relates to the 2001 acquisition of intellectual property from Royal Crown Company, Inc. including the right to manufacture our concentrates, with all related inventions, processes, technologies, technical and manufacturing information, know-how and the use of the Royal Crown brand outside of North America and Mexico (the Rights). This asset has a net book value of $45.0 million as more fully described in Note 1 to the Financial Statements. As of January 2, 2010, other intangible assets were $110.5 million, which consisted principally of $74.8 million of customer relationships that arose from acquisitions and trademarks of $9.5 million. Customer relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis for the period over which we expect to receive economic benefits which is up to 15 years. We review the estimated useful life of these intangible assets annually, taking into consideration the specific net cash flows related to the intangible asset, unless it is required more frequently due to a triggering event such as the loss of a customer. The permanent loss of any customer included in the intangible asset would result in impairment in the value of the intangible asset or accelerated amortization and could lead to an impairment of fixed assets that were used to service that client. Principally, a decrease in expected operating segment cash flows, changes in market conditions, loss of key customers and a change in our imputed cost of capital may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or the Rights. For additional information on accounting policies we have in place for goodwill impairment, see our discussion under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes. Our stock price may be volatile. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). The market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future, based on a variety of factors, including future announcements covering us or our key customers or competitors, government regulations, litigation, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, fluctuations in quarterly operating results or general conditions in our industry. Furthermore, stock prices for many companies fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results. Those fluctuations and general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions or international currency fluctuations and demand for our services, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 19 Table of Contents Failure to maintain our stock exchange listings would adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of our common stock. We have, in the recent past, received notice of non-compliance with NYSE listing requirements due to our share price trading below $1.00 for periods of time. While we have cured such deficiencies, if we are not able to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the NYSE and/or TSX, our shares may be subject to removal from listing on the NYSE and/or TSX. Trading in our common stock after a delisting, if any, would likely be conducted in the over-the-counter markets in the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board or the pink sheets and could also be subject to additional restrictions. As a consequence of a delisting, our shareholders would find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our common shares. In addition, a delisting would make our common stock substantially less attractive as collateral for margin and purpose loans, for investment by financial institutions under their internal policies or state investment laws, or as consideration in future capital raising. We may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or we could experience strikes. As of January 2, 2010, 873 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically expire every three to five years at various dates. We may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all. This could result in strikes or work stoppages, which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales. The terms of existing or renewed agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency. We depend on key information systems and third-party service providers. We depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business, provide information to management and prepare financial reports. We rely on third-party providers for the majority of our key information systems and business processing services, including hosting our primary data center.
