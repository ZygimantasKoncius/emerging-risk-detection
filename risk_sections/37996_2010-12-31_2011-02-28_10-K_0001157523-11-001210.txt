ITEM 1A. Risk Factors (continued) New or increased credit, consumer, or data protection or other regulations resulting in higher costs and/or additional financing restrictions. As a finance company, Ford Credit is highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates. In the United States, its operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Fair Credit Reporting Act. In some countries outside the United States, Ford Credit's subsidiaries are regulated banking institutions and are required, among other things, to maintain minimum capit al reserves. In many other locations, governmental authorities require companies to have licenses in order to conduct financing businesses. Efforts to comply with these laws and regulations impose significant costs on Ford Credit, and affect the conduct of its business. Additional regulation could add significant cost or operational constraints that might impair its profitability. Inability of Ford Credit to obtain competitive funding. Other institutions that provide automotive financing to certain of our competitors have access to relatively low-cost government-insured or other funding. For example, financial institutions with bank holding company status may have access to other lower cost sources of funding. Access by our competitors' dealers and customers to financing provided by financial institutions with relatively low-cost funding that is not available to Ford Credit could adversely affect Ford Credit's ability to support the sale of Ford vehicles at competitive cost and rates. This in turn would adversely affect the marketability of F ord vehicles in comparison to certain competitive brands. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None to report.
