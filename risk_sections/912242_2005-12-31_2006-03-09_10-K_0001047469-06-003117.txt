Management's Overview and Summary The Macerich Company (the "Company") is involved in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management, and leasing of regional and community shopping centers located throughout the United States. The Company is the sole general partner of, and owns a majority of the ownership interests in, The Macerich Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"). As of December 31, 2005, the Operating Partnership owned or had an ownership interest in 75 regional shopping centers, 20 community shopping centers and two development properties aggregating approximately 78.9 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"). These 97 regional, community and development shopping centers are referred to hereinafter as the "Centers", unless the context otherwise requires. The Company is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") and conducts all of its operations through the Operating Partnership and the Company's management companies. The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The following discussion compares the activity for the year ended December 31, 2005 to results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004. Also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2003. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Acquisitions and dispositions The financial statements reflect the following acquisitions, dispositions and changes in ownership subsequent to the occurrence of each transaction. On January 2, 2003, the Company sold its 67% interest in Paradise Village Gateway, a 296,153 square foot Phoenix area urban village, for approximately $29.4 million. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay a portion of the term loan. The sale resulted in a loss on sale of asset of $0.2 million. 40 The Macerich Company On January 31, 2003, the Company purchased its joint venture partner's 50% interest in FlatIron Crossing.

The mall is owned in a 50/50 joint venture with an institutional partner. On January 30, 2004, the Company, in a 50/50 joint venture with a private investment company, acquired Inland Center, a 1 million square foot super-regional mall in San Bernardino, California. The total purchase price was $63.3 million and concurrently with the acquisition, the joint venture placed a $54.0 million fixed rate loan on the property. The Company's share of the remainder of the purchase price was funded by cash and borrowings under the Company's line of credit. On May 11, 2004, the Company acquired an ownership interest in NorthPark Center, a 1.4 million square foot regional mall in Dallas, Texas. The Company's initial investment in the property was $30.0 million which was funded by borrowings under the Company's line of credit.

On December 30, 2004, the Company purchased the unaffiliated owners' 50% tenants in common interest in Paradise Village Ground Leases, Village Center, Village Crossroads, Village Fair and Paradise Village Office Park II. All of these assets are located in Phoenix, Arizona. The total purchase price was $50.0 million which included the assumption of the unaffiliated owners' share of debt of $15.2 million. The balance of the purchase price was paid in cash and borrowings from the Company's line of credit. Accordingly, the Company now owns 100% of these assets. On January 5, 2005, the Company sold Arizona Lifestyle Galleries for $4.3 million. The sale resulted in a gain on sale on asset of $0.3 million. On January 11, 2005, the Company became a 15% owner in a joint venture that acquired Metrocenter, a 1.3 million square foot super-regional mall in Phoenix, Arizona. The total purchase price was $160 million and concurrently with the acquisition, the joint venture placed a $112 million loan on the property. The Company's share of the purchase price, net of the debt, was $7.2 million which was funded by cash and borrowings under the Company's line of credit. On January 21, 2005, the Company formed a 50/50 joint venture with a private investment company. The joint venture acquired a 49% interest in Kierland Commons, a 437,000 square foot mixed use center in Phoenix, Arizona. The joint venture's purchase price for the interest in the center was $49.0 million. The Company assumed its share of the underlying property debt and funded the remainder of its share of the purchase price by cash and borrowings under the Company's line of credit. On April 8, 2005, the Company acquired Ridgmar Mall, a 1.3 million square foot super-regional mall in Fort Worth, Texas. The acquisition was completed in a 50/50 joint venture with an affiliate of Walton Street Capital, LLC. The purchase price was $71.1 million. Concurrent with the closing, a $57.4 million loan bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.0725% was placed on the property. The balance of the purchase price was funded by borrowings under the Company's line of credit. 42 The Macerich Company On April 25, 2005, the Company and the Operating Partnership completed its acquisition of Wilmorite Properties, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Wilmorite") and Wilmorite Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Wilmorite Holdings"). Wilmorite's portfolio includes interests in 11 regional malls and two open-air community shopping centers with 13.4 million square feet of space located in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Kentucky and Virginia. The total purchase price was approximately $2.333 billion, plus adjustments for working capital, including the assumption of approximately $877.2 million of existing debt with an average interest rate of 6.43% and the issuance of $234 million of convertible preferred units ("CPUs") and $5.8 million of common units in Wilmorite Holdings. The balance of the consideration to the equity holders of Wilmorite and Wilmorite Holdings was paid in cash, which was provided primarily by a five-year, $450 million term loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.50% and a $650 million acquisition loan with a term of up to two years and bearing interest initially at LIBOR plus 1.60%. An affiliate of the Operating Partnership is the general partner and, together with other affiliates, own approximately 83% of Wilmorite Holdings, with the remaining 17% held by those limited partners of Wilmorite Holdings who elected to receive CPUs or common units in Wilmorite Holdings rather than cash. Approximately $213 million of the CPUs can be redeemed, subject to certain conditions, for the portion of the Wilmorite portfolio generally located in the area of Rochester, New York. The Wilmorite portfolio, exclusive of Tysons Corner Center and Tysons Corner Office (collectively referred herein as "Tysons Center"), are referred to herein as the "2005 Wilmorite Centers." The Mall of Victor Valley, La Cumbre Plaza, Fiesta Mall, Paradise Village Ground Leases, Village Center, Village Crossroads, Village Fair and Paradise Village Office Park II are referred to herein as the "2004 Acquisition Centers." Biltmore Fashion Park, Inland Center, Kierland Commons, Metrocenter, NorthPark Center, Ridgmar Mall and Tysons Center are joint ventures and these properties are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The Company's share of the results of these acquisitions are reflected in the consolidated results of operations of the Company in the income statement line item entitled "Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures." Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred due to the transactions described above including the acquisition of the 2005 Wilmorite Centers and the 2004 Acquisition Centers. Kierland Commons, Metrocenter, Ridgmar Mall and Tysons Center are referred to herein as the "2005 Joint Venture Acquisition Centers." Biltmore Fashion Park, Inland Center and NorthPark Center are referred to herein as the "2004 Joint Venture Acquisition Centers." 29th Street, Parklane Mall, Santa Monica Place and Queens Center were under redevelopment during all or a portion of the reporting periods and are referred to herein as the "Redevelopment Centers." La Encantada and Scottsdale 101 were under development during all or a portion of the reporting periods and are referred to herein as the "Development Properties." All other Centers, excluding the Redevelopment Centers, the Development Properties, the 2005 Wilmorite Centers, the 2004 Acquisition Centers, the 2005 Joint Venture Acquisition Centers and the 2004 Acquisition Centers, are referred to herein as the "Same Centers," unless the context otherwise requires. Inflation In the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease The Macerich Company 43 term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"). In addition, about 6%-13% of the leases expire each year, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. Additionally, historically the majority of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses. In January 2005, the Company began entering into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any center. This change shifts the burden of cost control to the Company. Seasonality The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. Critical Accounting Policies The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, and estimates for environmental matters. The Company's significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the following policies are deemed to be critical. Revenue Recognition Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease. The difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight lining of rent adjustment." Currently, 37% of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for CPI rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease. The Company believes that using an annual multiple of CPI increases, rather than fixed contractual rent increases, results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases. Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants' specified sales targets have been met. Estimated recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. 44 The Macerich Company Property Costs related to the development, redevelopment, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. Interest incurred or imputed on development, redevelopment and construction projects is capitalized until construction is substantially complete. Maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes HVAC equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc. are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings. Property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Buildings and improvements 5-40 years Tenant improvements initial term of related lease Equipment and furnishings 5-7 years Accounting for Acquisitions The Company accounts for all acquisitions entered into subsequent to June 30, 2001 in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations." The Company will first determine the value of the land and buildings utilizing an "as if vacant" methodology. The Company will then assign a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition. The balance of the purchase price will be allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities. Tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair market value basis at acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms. The tenant improvements are classified as an asset under real estate investments and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (i) origination value, which represents the value associated with "cost avoidance" of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in our markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the "assumed vacant" property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. Origination value is recorded as an other asset and is amortized over the remaining lease terms. Value of in-place leases is recorded as another asset and amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases. Above or below market leases are classified as an other asset or liability, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market, and the asset or liability is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining terms of the leases. When the Company acquires real estate properties, the Company allocates the purchase price to the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using its estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between various components as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions. These allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or loses recorded on future sales of properties. The Macerich Company 45 Generally, the Company engages a valuation firm to assist with the allocation. Asset Impairment The Company assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its long-lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such factors include the tenant's ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. The Company may recognize impairment losses if the cash flows are not sufficient to cover its investment. Such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a center. Deferred Charges Costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight-line method. Cost relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. In-place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal. Leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the individual remaining lease years. The range of the terms of the agreements are as follows: Deferred lease costs 1-15 years Deferred financing costs 1-15 years In-place lease values Remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal Leasing commissions and legal costs 5-10 years Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Revenues Minimum and percentage rents increased by 40.4% to $487.5 million in 2005 from $347.3 million in 2004. Approximately $92.9 million of the increase relates to the 2005 Wilmorite Centers, $1.6 million relates to the Same Centers, $21.6 million relates to the 2004 Acquisition Centers and $24.1 million primarily relates to Queens Center and the Development Properties. The amount of straight-lined rents, included in minimum rent, was $6.7 million in 2005 compared to $1.0 million in 2004. This increase in straight-lining of rents relates to the 2005 Wilmorite Centers and the 2004 Acquisition Centers which is offset by decreases resulting from the Company structuring the majority of its new leases using an annual multiple of CPI increases, which generally do not require straight-lining treatment. The amortization of above and below market leases, which is recorded in minimum rents, increased to $11.6 million in 2005 from $9.2 million in 2004. The increase is primarily due to the 2005 Wilmorite Centers and the 2004 Acquisition Centers. Tenant recoveries increased to $229.5 million in 2005 from $159.0 million in 2004. Approximately $52.9 million of the increase relates to the 2005 Wilmorite Centers, $5.3 million relates to Queens Center 46 The Macerich Company and the Development Properties, $9.2 million relates to the 2004 Acquisition Centers and $3.1 million relates to the Same Centers. Management Companies' revenues increased by 21.4% to $26.1 million in 2005 from $21.5 million in 2004 primarily due to increased management fees received from the 2005 and 2004 Joint Venture Acquisition Centers and third party management contracts. Shopping Center and Operating Expenses Shopping center and operating expenses increased to $243.8 million in 2005 compared to $164.5 million in 2004. This increase is a result of $54.9 million of expenses from the 2005 Wilmorite Centers, $10.5 million from the 2004 Acquisition Centers, $5.5 million from Queens Center and the Development Properties and $2.0 million from increased operating and ground rent expenses at the Same Centers. In addition, there was a write-off of a contingent compensation liability of $6.4 million in 2004. Management Companies' Operating Expenses Management Companies' operating expenses increased by 19.7% to $52.8 million in 2005 from $44.1 million in 2004, primarily due to higher compensation expense in 2005 compared to 2004. REIT General and Administrative Expenses REIT general and administrative expenses increased to $12.1 million in 2005 from $11.1 million in 2004, primarily due to increases in stock-based compensation expense compared to 2004. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased to $206.1 million in 2005 from $142.1 million in 2004. Approximately $60.6 million relates to the 2005 Wilmorite Centers, $3.0 million relates to the 2004 Acquisition Centers and $3.6 million relates to Queens Center and the Development Properties. This is offset by a $3.2 million decrease relating to the Same Centers. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $249.9 million in 2005 from $146.3 million in 2004. Approximately $26.6 million relates to the assumed debt from the 2005 Wilmorite Centers, $39.8 million relates to the term and acquisition loans for the Wilmorite Acquisition, $19.8 million relates to increased borrowings and higher interest rates under the Company's line of credit, $2.0 million relates to the Northridge Center loan which closed on June 30, 2004, $5.9 million relates to the 2004 Acquisition Centers, $10.6 million relates to Queens Center and the Development Properties and $4.5 million relates to an increase in interest rates on floating rate debt at the Same Centers. These increases are offset in part by a $4.6 million decrease related to the payoff of the $250 million term loan on July 30, 2004. Additionally, capitalized interest was $10.0 million in 2005, down from $8.9 million in 2004. Minority Interest The minority interest represents the 19.0% weighted average interest of the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company during 2005. This compares to 19.5% not owned by the Company during 2004. The Macerich Company 47 Equity in Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures The equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures was $76.3 million for 2005, compared to $54.9 million in 2004. This primarily relates to increased net income from the 2005 and 2004 Joint Venture Acquisition Centers of $13.7 million. Included in the equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures is the Company's pro rata share of straight-line rents, which increased to $4.8 million in 2005 from $1.0 million in 2004. Income Tax Benefit Income tax benefit from taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs") decreased by $3.4 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the tax effects of state taxes for states in which the TRSs are combined with the Company, the tax effect of stock-based compensation and the tax effects related to certain acquired assets in 2004. Gain on Sale of Assets In 2005, a gain of $1.3 million was recorded relating to land sales compared to a $0.9 million gain on land sales in 2004. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt In 2005, the Company recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million related to the refinancing of the Valley View Mall loan. In 2004, the Company recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of $1.6 million related to the payoff of a loan at one of the Redevelopment Centers and the payoff of the $250 million term loan on July 30, 2004. Discontinued Operations The gain on sale of $0.2 million in 2005 relates primarily to the sale of Arizona Lifestyle Galleries on January 5, 2005. In 2004, the gain on sale primarily related to the $6.8 million gain from the sale of the Westbar property on December 16, 2004. The decrease in income from discontinued operations relates to the Westbar property. Funds From Operations Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, Funds from Operations ("FFO")Diluted increased 12.6% to $336.8 million in 2005 from $299.2 million in 2004. For the reconciliation of FFO and FFO-diluted to net income available to common stockholders, see "Funds from Operations." Operating Activities Cash flow from operations was $235.3 million in 2005 compared to $213.2 million in 2004. The increase is primarily due to the foregoing results at the Centers and offset by a decrease in distributions of income from unconsolidated joint ventures in 2005 compared to 2004. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $131.9 million in 2005 compared to $489.8 million in 2004. The change resulted primarily from increases in distributions of capital from unconsolidated joint ventures. This is offset by the joint venture acquisitions of Metrocenter and Kierland Commons, the Company's additional contributions to NorthPark Center and the decreased development, redevelopment, expansion and 48 The Macerich Company renovation of Centers in 2005 compared to 2004 due to completion of the Queens Center and La Encantada projects. Financing Activities Cash flow used in financing activities was $20.3 million in 2005 compared to cash flow provided by financing activities of $308.4 million in 2004. The 2005 decrease compared to 2004 resulted primarily from fewer refinancings for 2005 than 2004 and increased dividend payments to common stockholders. Additionally, the funding of the Queens construction loan was $65.7 million less in 2005 compared to 2004 due to the substantial completion of the expansion project. Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 Revenues Minimum and percentage rents increased by 16.3% to $347.3 million in 2004 from $298.7 million in 2003. Approximately $11.7 million of the increase relates to the Same Centers, $0.8 million of the increase relates to the Company acquiring 50% of its joint venture partner's interest in FlatIron Crossing, $7.4 million relates to the 2003 Acquisition Center, $10.1 million relates to the 2004 Acquisition Centers and $22.0 million relates to the Redevelopment and Development Centers, primarily Queens Center, La Encantada and Scottsdale 101 where phases of the developments have been completed. Additionally, these increases in minimum and percentage rents are offset by decreasing revenues of $3.4 million related to the Company's sale of a 49.9% interest in the Village at Corte Madera. The amortization of above and below market leases, which is recorded in minimum rents, increased to $9.2 million in 2004 from $6.1 million in 2003. The increase is primarily due to the 2003 Acquisition Center, 2004 Acquisition Centers and the Company acquiring 50% of its joint venture partner's interest in FlatIron Crossing. The amount of straight-lined rents, included in minimum rent, was $1.0 million in 2004 as compared to $2.9 million in 2003. The decrease is due to the structuring of new leases with rent increases based upon annual multiples of CPI rather than fixed contractual rent increases. Tenant recoveries increased to $159.0 million in 2004 from $152.7 in 2003. Approximately $0.1 million relates to the Company acquiring 50% of its joint venture partner's interest in FlatIron Crossing, $3.4 million relates to the Redevelopment and Development Centers, primarily Queens Center, La Encantada and Scottsdale 101, $4.4 million relates to the 2003 Acquisition Center and $3.7 million relates to the 2004 Acquisition Centers. This is offset by a $3.8 million decrease due to a change in estimated recovery rates at the Same Centers and a $1.1 million decrease relating to the Company's sale of a 49.9% partnership interest in the Village at Corte Madera. Management Companies' revenues increased by 47.3% to $21.5 million in 2004 compared to $14.6 million in 2003 primarily due to consolidating Macerich Management Company effective July 1, 2003 in accordance with FIN 46. Prior to July 1, 2003, the Macerich Management Company was accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Macerich Company 49 Shopping Center and Operating Expenses Shopping center and operating expenses increased to $164.5 million in 2004 compared to $151.3 million in 2003. The increase is a result of $4.6 million related to the 2003 Acquisition Center, $4.2 million due to the 2004 Acquisition Centers, $7.3 million related to the Redevelopment and Development Centers, primarily Queens Center, La Encantada and Scottsdale 101, $0.1 million related to the Company acquiring 50% of its joint venture partner's interest in FlatIron Crossing and $5.3 million relating to the Same Centers due to increases in recoverable and non-recoverable expenses. This is offset by a decrease of non-recoverable expenses due to a write-off of a $6.4 million compensation liability and a $1.4 million decrease related to the Company's sale of a 49.9% partnership interest in the Village at Corte Madera. Management Companies' Operating Expenses Expenses increased by 37.8% to $44.1 million in 2004 from $32.0 million in 2003 primarily due to consolidating Macerich Management Company effective July 1, 2003 in accordance with FIN 46. Prior to July 1, 2003, the Macerich Management Company was accounted for using the equity method of accounting. REIT General and Administrative Expenses REIT general and administrative expenses increased to $11.1 million in 2004 from $8.5 million in 2003, primarily due to increases in professional services and stock-based compensation expense. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased to $142.1 million in 2004 from $104.9 million in 2003.

Additionally, $12.9 million of depreciation and amortization was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 due to the 2002, 2003 and 2004 acquisitions. This is offset by a $1.1 million decrease relating to the sale of 49.9% of the partnership interest in the Village at Corte Madera. 50 The Macerich Company Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $146.3 million in 2004 from $130.7 million in 2003. Approximately $4.5 million of the increase relates to the refinancing of FlatIron Crossing on November 4, 2003, $4.8 million relates to the $250 million of unsecured notes issued on May 13, 2003, $5.3 million relates to increased borrowings on the Company's line of credit, $2.0 million relates to the 2003 Acquisition Center, $2.0 million relates to the 2004 Acquisition Centers and $8.7 million relates primarily to Queens Center, La Encantada and Scottsdale 101. These increases are offset by $2.0 million, which relates to the Company's sale of a 49.9% partnership interest in the Village at Corte Madera, $4.1 million relates to the payoff of the $196.5 million term loan on July 30, 2004, $2.5 million relates to the payoff of the 29th Street loan on February 3, 2004 and $5.9 million relates to other financing activity at the Same Centers. Capitalized interest was $8.9 million in 2004, down from $12.1 million in 2003. Minority Interest The minority interest represents the 19.5% weighted average interest of the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company during 2004. This compares to 20.74% not owned by the Company during 2003. Equity in Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Macerich Management Company The income from unconsolidated joint ventures and the Macerich Management Company was $54.9 million for 2004, compared to income of $59.3 million in 2003. This decrease is primarily due to increased depreciation relating to SFAS No. 141 on the 2004 Joint Venture Acquisition Centers and consolidating Macerich Management Company effective July 1, 2003 in accordance with FIN 46. Prior to July 1, 2003, the Macerich Management Company was accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Income Tax Benefit Income tax benefit from TRSs increased by $5.0 million in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to the tax effects of state taxes for states in which the TRSs are combined with the Company, the change in tax rates applicable to certain acquired assets, the tax effect of stock-based compensation and the release of a valuation allowance in 2003. Gain on Sale of Assets In 2004, a gain of $0.9 million was recorded relating to land sales compared to $1.0 million of land sales in 2003. A gain of $12.4 million in 2003 represents primarily the Company's sale of 49.9% of its partnership interest in the Village at Corte Madera on May 15, 2003 and the sale of the Shops at Gainey Village. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt In 2004, the Company recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of $1.6 million related to the payoff of a loan at one of the Redevelopment Centers and the payoff of the $196.8 million term loan. Discontinued Operations In 2004, the $7.1 million gain on sale relates primarily to the sale of the Westbar property. The gain on sale of $22.0 million in 2003 relates primarily to the sale of Bristol Center on August 4, 2003. The Macerich Company 51 Net Income Available to Common Stockholders Primarily as a result of the sale of Bristol Center in 2003, the purchase of the 2003 Acquisition Center and the 2004 Acquisition Centers, the sale of 49.9% of the partnership interest in the Village at Corte Madera, the Company acquiring 50% of its joint venture partner's interest in FlatIron Crossing, the change in depreciation expense due to SFAS No. 141, the redevelopment of Queens Center, the developments of La Encantada and Scottsdale 101 and the foregoing results, net income available to common stockholders decreased to $82.5 million in 2004 from $113.2 million in 2003. Operating Activities Cash flow from operations was $213.2 million in 2004 compared to $215.7 million in 2003. The decrease is primarily due to the foregoing results at the Centers as mentioned above. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $489.8 million in 2004 compared to cash used in investing activities of $341.3 million in 2003. The change resulted primarily from the proceeds of $107.2 million received in 2003 from the sale of Paradise Village Gateway, the Shops at Gainey Village, Bristol Center and the 49.9% interest in the Village at Corte Madera which is offset by increased contributions to joint ventures and acquisitions of joint ventures, $291.5 million relating to the 2004 Acquisition Centers and by the Company's purchase of its joint venture partner's 50% interest in FlatIron Crossing on January 31, 2003. Financing Activities Cash flow provided by financing activities was $308.4 million in 2004 compared to cash flow provided by financing activities of $115.7 million in 2003. The 2004 increase compared to 2003 resulted primarily from $94.1 million of additional funding relating to Queens construction loan, the $85.0 million Northridge loan, the new $84.0 million loan at Fiesta Mall and increased borrowings under the Company's line of credit, which is offset by the Company acquiring 50% of its joint venture partner's interest in FlatIron Crossing in January 2003, the $32.3 million funding of the Panorama loan in the first quarter of 2003 and increased dividends being paid in 2004 compared to 2003. Funds From Operations Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, Funds from OperationsDiluted increased 11.1% to $299.2 million in 2004 from $269.1 million in 2003. For the reconciliation of FFO and FFO-diluted to net income available to common stockholders, see "Funds from Operations." Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company intends to meet its short term liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, working capital reserves, property secured borrowings, unsecured corporate borrowings and borrowings under the revolving line of credit. The Company anticipates that revenues will continue to provide necessary funds for its operating expenses and debt service requirements, and to pay dividends to stockholders in accordance with REIT requirements. The Company anticipates that cash generated from operations, together with cash on hand, will be adequate to fund capital expenditures which will not be 52 The Macerich Company reimbursed by tenants, other than non-recurring capital expenditures. The following tables summarize capital expenditures (in millions) incurred at the Centers for the years ending December 31: Consolidated Centers: 2005 2004 2003 Acquisitions of property and equipment $1,767.2 $301.1 $359.2 Development, redevelopment and expansion of Centers 77.2 139.3 166.3 Renovations of Centers 51.1 21.2 21.7 Tenant allowances 21.8 10.9 7.3 Deferred leasing charges 21.8 16.8 15.2 Total $1,939.1 $489.3 $569.7 Joint Venture Centers (at Company's pro rata share): Acquisitions of property and equipment(1) $736.4 $41.1 $(19.2) Development, redevelopment and expansion of Centers 79.4 6.6 17.6 Renovations of Centers 32.2 10.1 2.8 Tenant allowances 8.9 10.5 4.7 Deferred leasing charges 5.1 3.7 3.3 Total $862.0 $72.0 $9.2 (1) Includes the Company's purchase of its joint venture partner's 50% interest in FlatIron Crossing on January 31, 2003. Management expects similar levels to be incurred in future years for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges and to incur between $250 million to $350 million in 2006 for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations. Capital for major expenditures or major developments and redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from equity or debt financings which include borrowings under the Company's line of credit and construction loans. However, many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions. The Company believes that it will have access to the capital necessary to expand its business in accordance with its strategies for growth and maximizing FFO. The Company presently intends to obtain additional capital necessary for these purposes through a combination of debt or equity financings, joint ventures and the sale of non-core assets. The Company believes joint venture arrangements have in the past and may in the future provide an attractive alternative to other forms of financing, whether for acquisitions or other business opportunities. The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31, 2005 was $6.9 billion (including $1.5 billion of its pro rata share of joint venture debt). This equated to a debt to Total Market Capitalization (defined as total debt of the Company, including its pro rata share of joint venture debt, plus aggregate market value of outstanding shares of common stock, assuming full conversion of OP Units and preferred stock into common stock) ratio of approximately 56.0% at December 31, 2005. The majority of the Company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgages payable collateralized by individual properties. The Macerich Company 53 The Company filed a shelf registration statement, effective June 6, 2002, to sell securities. The shelf registration was for a total of $1.0 billion of common stock, common stock warrant or common stock rights. The Company sold a total of 15.2 million shares of common stock under this shelf registration on November 27, 2002. The aggregate offering price of this transaction was approximately $440.2 million, leaving approximately $559.8 million available under the shelf registration statement. In addition, the Company filed another shelf registration statement, effective October 27, 2003, to sell up to $300 million of preferred stock. On January 12, 2006, the Company filed a shelf registration statement registering an unspecified amount of Common Stock as may from time to time be offered. On January 19, 2006, the Company issued 10.9 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $747.0 million. The net proceeds were used to pay off the $619.0 million acquisition loan (See Note 15 of the Company's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and to pay down the line of credit pending use to pay part of the purchase price for Valley River Center (See Recent DevelopmentsAcquisitions). The Company had a $425.0 million revolving line of credit. This revolving line of credit had a three-year term through July 26, 2005 with a one-year extension option. The interest rate fluctuated from LIBOR plus 1.75% to LIBOR plus 3.00% depending on the Company's overall leverage level. On July 30, 2004, the Company amended and expanded the revolving line of credit to $1.0 billion and extended the maturity to July 30, 2007 plus a one-year extension. In April 2005, the interest rate on the facility was reduced to 1.50% over LIBOR based on the Company's current leverage level. The interest rate fluctuates from LIBOR plus 1.15% to LIBOR plus 1.70% depending on the Company's overall leverage level. As of December 31, 2005, $863.0 million of borrowings were outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.93%. On May 13, 2003, the Company issued $250.0 million in unsecured notes maturing in May 2007 with a one-year extension option bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.50%. The proceeds were used to pay down and create more availability under the Company's line of credit. At December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the entire $250.0 million of notes were outstanding at an interest rate of 6.0% and 4.45%, respectively. The Company had an interest rate swap agreement which effectively fixed the interest rate at 4.45% from November 2003 to October 13, 2005. Concurrently with the Wilmorite closing, the Company modified these unsecured notes. The interest rate was reduced to LIBOR plus 1.50%. At December 31, 2005, the Company had cash and cash equivalents available of $155.1 million.
