BUSINESS. General Merchants Group, Inc. (the Company), which was incorporated in August 1986 as a Delaware holding company, offers property and casualty insurance generally to preferred risk individuals and small to medium sized businesses in the northeastern United States through its wholly owned subsidiary, Merchants Insurance Company of New Hampshire, Inc. (MNH). Administration The Company and MNH operate and manage their business in conjunction with Merchants Mutual Insurance Company (Mutual), a New York domiciled mutual property and casualty insurance company, under a services agreement (the Services Agreement) that became effective January 1, 2003. At December 31, 2005, Mutual owned 12.0% of the Companys issued and outstanding common stock. The Company and MNH do not have any operating assets or employees. Under the Services Agreement, Mutual provides the Company and MNH with the facilities, management and personnel required to operate their day-to-day business. The Services Agreement covers substantially the same services previously provided under a management agreement among the Company, MNH and Mutual (the Management Agreement) from 1986 to 2002. The Services Agreement provides for negotiated fees (subject to periodic adjustment) for administrative, underwriting, claims and investment management services. The Company and MNH have the discretion to remove invested assets from their investment portfolios managed by Mutual. The Services Agreement contains termination provisions that vary based on the service rendered. Underwriting services may be terminated on one years notice, but the termination may not be effective before January 1, 2008. Claims and administrative services may be terminated on 6 months notice. In accordance with the Services Agreement, in June 2005 the Company and MNH notified Mutual that they will terminate the Investment and Cash Management Services Annex (which pertains to the management of the Companys investment portfolio) to the Services Agreement as of June 30, 2006. The Company and MNH intend to solicit bids, including possibly from Mutual, for the management of their investment portfolio after the effective date of the termination. Effective January 1, 2003, Mutual and MNH agreed to pool, or share, underwriting results on their traditional insurance business (Traditional Business) by means of a reinsurance pooling agreement (the Pooling Agreement). The Pooling Agreement applies to premiums earned and losses incurred after the effective date. It does not apply to any new endeavor of either Mutual or MNH outside of their Traditional Business, unless the companies agree otherwise. Neither Mutual or MNH has entered into any endeavor outside of their Traditional Business. The Pooling Agreement provides for MNH to cede, or transfer, to Mutual all premiums and risks on its Traditional Business during the term of the agreement, and then to assume from Mutual a 3 Table of Contents percentage of all of Mutuals and MNHs Traditional Business (the Pooled Business). MNH assumed 30% of the Pooled Business in 2005, 35% in 2004 and 40% in 2003. MNHs share of the Pooled Business will be 25% in 2006 and 2007, though not to exceed $42.5 million and $37.5 million in net written premiums, respectively. If the parties agree, MNH may increase its share or maximum amount of assumed net premiums written of the Pooled Business for any year. Mutual retains a share of the risk in MNHs Traditional Business under Mutuals control pursuant to a profit and loss sharing arrangement in the Pooling Agreement based on the loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) experience of the Pooled Business. The Company believes the Pooling Agreement and profit (or loss) sharing feature included therein aligns the interests of MNH and Mutual. The decreasing amount of Traditional Business assumed under the Pooling Agreement is intended to provide MNH with the capacity to pursue insurance opportunities independently of Mutual, thereby reducing its dependence on Mutual as its only source of business. The Company and MNH are seeking to identify new business initiatives and the Company has retained an investment bank to assist in its effort to employ the available capacity. Generally, the new business initiatives are expected to be in lines of business which are complementary to the Traditional Business underwritten through the Pooling Agreement with Mutual. The Pooling Agreement may be terminated by either party at the beginning of any calendar year on or after January 1, 2008 upon not less than 6 months notice. Furthermore, the Pooling Agreement may be terminated effective as of January 1, 2007 upon 6 months notice, but only by MNH and only if the ratio of net losses and LAE to net earned premiums on a cumulative basis from the inception of the Pooling Agreement exceeds 76%, as of the date notice is given. As of December 31, 2005, the ratio of net losses and LAE to net earned premiums on a cumulative basis since the inception of the Pooling Agreement was 65.8%. Marketing Mutual markets the Traditional Business of the Company and Mutual jointly through approximately 500 independent agents. The primary marketing efforts of the Company and Mutual (collectively referred to as Merchants) are directed to those independent agents who, through their insurance expertise, the broad range of products they offer, and their focus on service, provide value for the insurance consumer. Mutual and the Company offer the same portfolio of insurance products. The Companys products are generally offered to preferred risks while Mutuals products are generally offered to standard risks. Preferred risks meet more restrictive underwriting criteria than standard risks and generally generate fewer losses. Accordingly, the preferred risks are charged premium rates that are typically 10-15% lower than standard rates. The Company believes that Merchants, as a regional insurance group, has certain advantages, including a closer relationship with its agents and a better knowledge of its operating territories that enable it to compete effectively against national carriers. The Company believes Merchants distinguishes itself from its competitors by providing its agents and policyholders with superior service and ease of doing business and products that target certain segments of the commercial and personal insurance markets. Merchants also offers an agents compensation program which, in addition to standard commission rates, includes a profit sharing plan. 4 Table of Contents Through Mutual, the Company services its agents from six Strategic Business Centers (Buffalo, Albany and Hauppauge, New York; Manchester, New Hampshire; Moorestown, New Jersey; and Columbus, Ohio) and from its home office in Buffalo, New York. The Strategic Business Centers are located in the Companys operating territories and focus primarily on policy sales and underwriting. The Regional Manager of a Strategic Business Center appoints new agents, and agrees upon premium objectives and annual unit sales with the principal(s) of each agency. Regional Managers and Territory Managers, or TMs, develop customized business plans for each agency. These plans identify profitable business opportunities and recommend the actions required to achieve the objectives agreed to by the agency and the Company. TMs meet frequently with targeted agencies sales staff to review Merchants renewal policies, as well as to solicit policies new to the agent and/or Merchants. While TMs are capable of providing quotes directly to the agent while in an agents office, much of that capability has migrated to Merchants internet website: www.merchantsgroup.com. There, agents are able to obtain instant quotes for certain commercial and personal lines of business. Presently, the businessowners, contractors coverall, commercial auto, homeowners and personal auto products are available for both instant quoting and issue from quote, allowing agents to enter all underwriting information required to issue policies for their customers over the password protected Agency Gateway of the website. This allows for rapid responses to agents quote requests and reduces expenses associated with manual quoting and policy issuance. Each Strategic Business Center has an Agents Advisory Council that meets at least twice a year. The Advisory Councils provide a forum for Merchants and its agents to discuss issues of mutual interest, and assure that the agents business needs are being considered by Merchants. Additionally, the Co-chairpersons of the Advisory Councils from each Strategic Business Center meet twice each year with senior officers. In addition to standard commissions paid as a percentage of premiums written, the Companys agents are eligible to participate in the Agents Profit Sharing Plan. This plan rewards agents based on total premiums written and the loss and allocated LAE ratio on business placed during each year by the agent with the Company and Mutual. The Company believes the terms of the Agents Profit Sharing Plan encourage its agents to increase the volume of profitable Traditional Business they place with Merchants. The Companys share of payments for the Agents Profit Sharing Plan for 2005 assumed under the Pooling Agreement totaled $1,404,000, or 2.4%, and $1,418,000 or 2.1% of the Companys share of group-wide direct premiums written for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Insurance Underwriting The Company is licensed to issue insurance policies in 13 states, primarily in the northeastern United States. In 2005, net premiums written totaled $45,135,000, with 76% of the net premiums written derived from commercial insurance and 24% from personal insurance. 5 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the distribution of the combined Company and Mutual Traditional Business direct premiums written by state for the years indicated. See the Administration section of this Item for further discussion. As of December 31, 2003 2004 2005 New York 60 % 63 % 63 % New Jersey 17 14 13 New Hampshire 9 8 8 Pennsylvania 6 7 7 Rhode Island 3 3 3 Massachusetts 2 3 4 Other 3 2 2 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % The Company and Mutual are licensed to underwrite most major lines of property and casualty insurance. They issue policies primarily to individuals and small to medium sized commercial businesses. The types of risks insured include: o Personal automobile  full coverage of standard performance automobiles, generally requiring drivers with good driving records during the past three years at the time of first issuance by Merchants. o Homeowners  properties generally with no losses in the last three years that are less than 30 years old and valued between $125,000 and $500,000. o Commercial automobile  primarily light and medium duty vehicles operating in a limited radius, with complete background information required of all drivers. o Commercial multi-peril  properties with medium to high construction quality and low to moderate fire exposure, and occupancies with low to moderate exposure to hazardous materials and processes. o General liability  low hazard service, mercantile and light processing businesses, generally with at least three years of business experience and with no losses in the last three years. o Workers compensation  risks with low loss frequency and severity, low to moderate exposure to hazardous materials and processes, and favorable experience modification factors. Generally, workers compensation insurance is written in conjunction with other commercial insurance. 6 Table of Contents The Company and Mutual use automated underwriting processes for personal automobile, homeowners and certain commercial products, which perform an initial review of policy applications based upon established underwriting guidelines. Applications that do not meet the guidelines for automated acceptance are either referred to underwriters who review the applications and assess exposure, or rejected if the risk characteristics are such that neither the Company nor Mutual would insure the applicant. Merchants establishes premium rates for most of its products based on its loss experience, in some cases after considering prospective loss costs provided by the Insurance Services Office, Inc., an industry advisory group, for the individual and commercial classes of business that it insures. Merchants establishes rates independently for its personal automobile and homeowners insurance policies and its specialty products, such as its Contractors Coverall Plus and businessowners policies. The following table shows, for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2005 (i) the amount of the Companys net premiums written attributable to various personal and commercial products and (ii) underwriting results attributable to each such product as measured by the calendar year loss and allocated loss adjustment expense (LALAE) ratio for such product. The LALAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and allocated LAE to net premiums earned for a given period.

Depending on the size of the increase or decrease in prior accident years LALAE, calendar year LALAE ratios may not be as indicative of the profitability of policies in force in a particular year as accident year LALAE ratios, which do not take into account increases or decreases in estimates of reserves for prior accident years LALAE. The following table sets forth the composition of voluntary direct premiums written for 2001 through 2005: For the Year Ended December 31, 2001 2002 2003(1) 2004(1) 2005(1) Commercial 58 % 40 % 63 % 73 % 79 % Personal 42 60 37 27 21 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Shown on a group-wide basis for the Pooled Business. See the Administration section of this Item for further discussion. Commercial Business Merchants commercial business is primarily retail and mercantile in nature and generally consists of small to medium sized, low hazard commercial risks which as a group have relatively stable loss ratios. Merchants underwriting criteria attempt to exclude classes of risks that are considered to be high hazard or volatile, or which involve substantial risk of latent injury or other long-tail liability exposures. The Company and Mutual offer specialized products within the commercial multi-peril line such as the Contractors Coverall Plus policy for artisan and trade contractors. The Company believes that it and Mutual can insure commercial business profitably by selecting those classes of risks that offer better than average profit potential and charging rates commensurate with the quality of the risk insured. Merchants competes for commercial business based upon the service it provides to agents and policyholders, the compensation it pays to its agents and the price of its products. Merchants establishes prices after considering its costs, the exposures inherent in a particular class of risk, estimated investment income, projected future trends in loss frequency and severity, the degree of competition within a specific territory and a provision for profit. Accordingly, the prices of Merchants commercial products may vary considerably from competitors prices. Personal Business Merchants offers personal automobile and homeowners insurance to preferred risk individuals, generally targeting experienced drivers with no accidents or moving violations in the last three years for personal automobile insurance, and medium to high value homes with systems (e.g. heating, plumbing, electrical) that are less than thirty years old in fire protected areas for homeowners insurance. Personal automobile premium rates attempt to cover costs associated with required participation in involuntary personal automobile programs, in addition to the costs directly associated with the policies written voluntarily. Due to volatility in the size of the New York Automobile Insurance Plan (NYAIP) and the poor loss experience associated with that business in most years, the Company historically had been unable to fully recover costs of the NYAIP business with premium rates charged for its voluntary personal automobile 8 Table of Contents business. In 2002 the Company implemented a moratorium on writing new voluntary personal automobile business in New York which remains in effect. Further, in order to minimize the adverse impact of assignments from the NYAIP, in 2003 the Company began to purchase territorial credits from an unaffiliated company. The credits against NYAIP assignments were generated by another insurance company for writing private passenger automobile business in localities in New York with private passenger automobile availability problems. The other insurance company, by nature of its concentration in private passenger automobile business in credit territories, generated more credits than it required to offset its NYAIP assignments. Involuntary Business As a condition to writing voluntary business in most states in which it operates, the Company and Mutual must participate in state-mandated programs that provide insurance for individuals and businesses unable to obtain insurance voluntarily, primarily for personal automobile insurance. The legislation creating these programs usually allocates a pro rata portion of the risks attributable to such insureds to each company writing voluntary business in the state on the basis of its historical voluntary premiums written or the number of automobiles which it historically insures voluntarily. Due to changing market conditions the Company cannot predict the size of the NYAIP for 2006 or future years. The Companys gross (direct and assumed) premiums written attributable to involuntary policies were $2,518,000, $3,259,000 and $3,430,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, mostly in New York. These amounts represent the Companys pro-forma share of the applicable amount of pooled direct premiums written. Pooling Agreement The Company believes pooling of risks is advantageous for the following reasons: (1) Mutuals risk selection, pricing, marketing and claims philosophies and practices are consistent with and complementary to the Companys; (2) as market conditions change, management can adjust eligibility criteria to permit Merchants as a group to participate in a changing rate environment without concern for any conflict of interest; (3) pooling, especially with Mutual subject to profit and loss sharing, more closely aligns the interests of the Company and Mutual; and (4) by reducing its share of participation in the pool, the Company is able to create more capacity to pursue other endeavors, which it might not otherwise be able to do as a result of regulatory constraints on non-renewal of business, particularly for personal business. Claims Insurance claims on policies written by the Company and by Mutual are investigated and settled by claims adjusters employed by Mutual pursuant to the Services Agreement. Mutual maintains three claims offices within its operating territories. In areas where there is insufficient claim volume to justify the cost of internal claims staff, the Company and Mutual use independent appraisers and adjusters to investigate claims. Merchants claims policy emphasizes timely investigation of claims, settlement of valid claims for equitable amounts, maintenance of adequate reserves for claims and control of external claims adjustment 9 Table of Contents expenses. In order to support its claims policy, Merchants maintains a program designed to ensure that as soon as practical, claims are assigned an accurate value based on available information. The program includes the centralization of certain branch claims operations and an emphasis on the training of claims adjusters and supervisors by senior claims staff. This claims policy is designed to provide agents and policyholders with prompt service and support. Claims settlement authority levels are established for each adjuster, supervisor and manager based on their expertise and experience. When Merchants receives notice of a claim, it is assigned to an adjuster based upon its type and severity. The claims staff then reviews the claim, obtains appropriate information and establishes a loss reserve. Claims that exceed certain dollar amounts or that cannot be readily settled are assigned to more experienced claims staff. Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves The Company, like other insurance companies, establishes reserves for losses and LAE. These reserves are estimates intended to cover the probable ultimate cost of settling all losses incurred and unpaid, including those losses not yet reported to the Company. An insurers ultimate liability is likely to differ from its interim estimates because during the life of a claim, which may be many years, additional facts affecting the amount of damages and an insurers liability may become known. The reserves of an insurer are frequently adjusted based on monitoring by the insurer and are periodically reviewed by state insurance departments. The Company retains an independent actuarial firm to satisfy state insurance departments requirements for the certification of reserves for losses and LAE. Loss reserves are established for known claims based on the type and circumstance of the loss and the results of similar losses. For claims not yet reported to the Company, loss reserves are based on statistical information from previous experience periods adjusted for inflation, trends in court decisions and economic conditions. LAE reserves are intended to cover the ultimate cost of investigating all losses that have occurred and defending lawsuits, if any, arising from these losses. LAE reserves are evaluated periodically using statistical techniques which compare current costs with historical data. Inflation is implicitly reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and review of historical reserve results. With the exception of workers compensation claims, loss reserves are not discounted for financial statement purposes. The Companys reserving process is based on the assumption that past experiences, adjusted for the effect of current developments and trends, are relevant in predicting future events. In the absence of specific developments, the process also assumes that the legal climate affecting the claims process and underlying liabilities remains constant. Other assumptions employed by the Company or its actuarial firm may change from time to time as circumstances change. In estimating loss and LAE reserves, the Company employs a number of actuarial methods, depending on their applicability to each product, in order to balance the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Typically, several estimates are developed for each product using different methods. However, the Company does not believe it is appropriate to sum the high and low values developed using different actuarial methods for each product to determine a range for the Companys total loss and LAE reserves. Instead the Companys actuary and its consulting actuary provide the Company with their respective best estimates of total loss and LAE reserves by summing their best estimate for each product. The Companys small size, the presence or absence of a limited number of moderate losses, as well as the timing of the reporting of such losses to the Company by claimants, could result in changes in actuarial estimates that are significant to the Companys net income for a quarter or a year. 10 Table of Contents Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation of incurred losses and LAE, the Company has recorded changes in reserves for prior accident years losses and LAE. In 2005 and 2004, the Company decreased reserves for prior years by $3,303,000 and $843,000, respectively, primarily due to favorable loss development related to private passenger auto liability and workers compensation policies, somewhat offset by unfavorable development on commercial package policies. In 2003, the Company decreased its reserves for prior years by $90,000. The following table sets forth the changes in the reserve for losses and LAE for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Reserve for losses and LAE at beginning of year $ 128,415 $ 146,474 $ 147,136 Less reinsurance recoverables (15,630 ) (22,715 ) (19,380 ) Net balance at beginning of year 112,785 123,759 127,756 Provision for losses and LAE for claims occurring in: Current year 29,711 38,524 49,702 Prior years (3,303 ) (843 ) (90 ) 26,408 37,681 49,612 Losses and LAE payments for claims occurring in: Current year (10,359 ) (13,647 ) (18,441 ) Prior years (27,450 ) (35,008 ) (35,168 ) (37,809 ) (48,655 ) (53,609 ) Reserve for losses and LAE at end of year, net 101,384 112,785 123,759 Plus reinsurance recoverables 13,807 15,630 22,715 Balance at end of year $ 115,191 $ 128,415 $ 146,474 The first line of the following table presents, as of the end of the year at the top of each column, the estimated amount of unpaid losses and LAE, net of reinsurance, for claims arising in that year and in all prior years, including claims that had occurred but were not yet reported to the Company. For each column, the rows of the table present, for the same group of claims, the amount of unpaid losses and LAE, net of reinsurance, as re-estimated as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate is modified as more information becomes known about the number and severity of claims for each year. The cumulative redundancy (deficiency) represents the change in the estimated amount of unpaid losses and LAE, net of reinsurance, from the end of the year at the top of each column through the end of 2005. For each column in the table, the change from the liability for losses and LAE shown on the first line to the liability as re-estimated as of the end of the following year was included in operating results for the following year. That change includes the change in the previous years column from the liability as re-estimated one year later to the liability as re-estimated two years later which, in turn, includes the change in the second preceding column from the liability as re-estimated two years later to the liability as re-estimated three years later, and so forth. 11 Table of Contents The rows of the table appearing under the caption Net paid (cumulative) as of: present, as of the end of each succeeding year, the amount of paid losses and LAE for claims unpaid at the end of the year at the top of each column: As of December 31, 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 (in thousands) Net liability for losses and LAE: $ 113,718 $ 126,260 $ 130,781 $ 126,820 $ 127,458 $ 131,178 $ 132,113 $ 127,756 $ 123,759 $ 112,785 Liability re- estimated as of: One year later 120,550 130,768 128,636 123,071 128,886 129,704 128,328 127,666 122,916 109,482 Two years later 128,192 133,029 130,498 120,345 123,299 129,621 132,674 129,722 122,071 Three years later 129,724 132,948 127,893 113,661 124,944 133,769 135,865 129,254 Four years later 131,647 129,210 122,508 114,068 128,121 138,538 137,813 Five years later 127,183 124,238 122,347 117,678 131,977 140,804 Six years later 123,521 124,319 125,741 120,958 133,913 Seven years later 123,679 127,659 128,998 123,359 Eight years later 126,285 130,280 130,907 Nine years later 128,433 131,887 Ten years later 129,291 Net cumulative redundancy (deficiency): $ (15,573 ) (5,627 ) (126 ) 3,461 (6,455 ) (9,626 ) (5,700 ) (1,498 ) 1,688 3,303 % (13.7 ) (4.5 ) (.1 ) 2.7 (5.1 ) (7.3 ) (4.3 ) (1.2 ) 1.4 2.9 Net paid (cumulative) as of: One year later 38,549 40,954 42,433 37,125 40,970 45,461 40,843 35,168 35,008 27,450 Two years later 64,323 69,035 66,477 63,325 69,393 70,075 64,959 61,03 56,290 Three years later 84,638 86,364 86,313 80,142 86,670 85,772 83,552 78,109 Four years later 96,491 98,300 97,770 89,383 96,222 98,053 96,986 Five years later 104,063 105,787 104,282 94,809 102,892 107,913 Six years later 109,492 109,639 107,431 99,131 108,438 Seven years later 111,851 111,822 110,193 103,180 Eight years later 113,593 114,246 113,200 Nine years later 114,959 116,279 Ten years later 116,589 Initial gross liability for losses and LAE: $ 120,114 $ 134,532 $ 141,157 $ 136,632 $ 133,485 $ 145,006 $ 151,354 $ 147,135 $ 146,475 $ 132,112 Initial ceded liability for losses and LAE: 6,396 8,272 10,376 9,812 6,027 13,828 19,241 19,379 22,716 19,327 Initial net liability $ 113,718 $ 126,260 $ 130,781 $ 126,820 $ 127,458 $ 131,178 $ 132,113 $ 127,756 $ 123,759 $ 112,785 Gross liability as currently re-estimated 137,404 142,021 139,310 131,801 146,704 172,475 170,726 161,139 149,354 132,977 Ceded liability as currently re-estimated 8,113 10,134 8,403 8,442 12,791 31,671 32,913 31,885 27,283 23,495 Net liability as currently re-estimated $ 129,291 $ 131,887 $ 130,907 $ 123,359 $ 133,913 $ 140,804 $ 137,813 $ 129,254 $ 122,071 $ 109,482 Gross cumulative redundancy (deficiency): $ (17,290 ) (7,489 ) 1,847 4,831 (13,219 ) (27,469 ) (19,372 ) (14,004 ) (2,879 ) (865 ) % (14.4 ) (5.7 ) 1.3 3.5 (9.9 ) (18.9 ) (12.8 ) (9.5 ) (2.0 ) (.7 ) 12 Table of Contents The loss and LAE reserves reported in the Companys consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) differ from those reported in the statements filed by MNH with the New Hampshire Insurance Department in accordance with statutory accounting principles (SAP) as follows: As of December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Loss and LAE reserves on a SAP basis $ 101,384 $ 112,785 $ 123,759 Adjustments: Ceded reinsurance balances recoverable 13,807 15,630 22,715 Loss and LAE reserves on a GAAP basis $ 115,191 $ 128,415 $ 146,474 Reinsurance The Company follows the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of the exposure under its policies and as consideration pays to its reinsurers a portion of the premium received on its policies. Insurance is ceded principally to reduce an insurers liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of coverage provided by its policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded. The Company is a party to reinsurance contracts under which certain types of policies are automatically reinsured without the need for approval by the reinsurer with respect to the individual risks that are covered (treaty reinsurance). The Company also is a party to reinsurance contracts which are handled on an individual policy or per risk basis and require the specific agreement of the reinsurer as to each risk insured (facultative reinsurance). Occasionally, the Company may secure facultative reinsurance to supplement its coverage under treaty reinsurance. Prior to January 1, 1998, the Companys excess of loss reinsurance agreements for automobile liability, general liability and workers compensation insurance provided for recovery of losses over $500,000 up to a maximum of $5,000,000 per occurrence. For claims occurring from 1987 through 1992, the $500,000 threshold was indexed for inflation for casualty lines other than workers compensation and New York State no-fault, and applied retroactively to all occurrences until they are settled. There was no index provision for casualty claims occurring after 1992. This coverage was supplemented by additional treaty reinsurance covering losses up to $5,000,000 in excess of the first $5,000,000. Prior to January 1, 1998, property reinsurance agreements provided for recovery of property losses over $500,000 up to $2,000,000 per occurrence without any index provision. Beginning January 1, 1998, the Companys property and casualty excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided for recovery of casualty losses over $500,000 up to $10,000,000 per occurrence and property losses over $500,000 up to $10,000,000 per risk. This coverage is supplemented by a contingent casualty layer of reinsurance for workers compensation claims of $5,000,000 in excess of the first $10,000,000 subject to a calendar year limit of $10,000,000. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company increased its retention on casualty losses to $750,000. Effective January 1, 2004, the Company adjusted the property loss occurrence limit to $5,000,000 per risk. Individual property facultative reinsurance was purchased for all exposures greater than $5,000,000. Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adjusted the 13 Table of Contents property loss occurrence limit to $7,000,000 per risk, with individual property facultative reinsurance purchased for exposures exceeding that amount. Property catastrophe coverage provides for recovery of 47.5% of the first $5,000,000 and of 95% of the next $55,000,000 above aggregate retained losses of $5,000,000 per occurrence. The property catastrophe reinsurance coverage is shared by the Company and Mutual in accordance with the Pooling Agreement (see Administration above) for a covered event. Under the terms of the Pooling Agreement (see Administration above) effective as of January 1, 2003 Mutual and MNH pool, or share, underwriting results on their Traditional Business. The Pooling Agreement does not apply to any new endeavor of either Mutual or MNH outside of their Traditional Business, unless the companies agree otherwise. The Pooling Agreement provides for MNH to cede, or transfer, to Mutual all of its premiums and risks on its Traditional Business during the term of the agreement, and then to assume from Mutual a percentage of all of Mutuals and MNHs Traditional Business (the Pooled Business). MNH assumed 30% of the Pooled Business in 2005, 35% of the Pooled Business in 2004 and 40% of the Pooled Business in 2003. MNHs share of the Pooled Business will be reduced to 25% in 2006 and 2007, though not to exceed $42.5 million and $37.5 million in assumed net written premiums, respectively. If the parties agree, MNH may increase its share or maximum amount of assumed net premiums written of the Pooled Business for any year. The decreasing amount of Traditional Business assumed under the Pooling Agreement is intended to provide MNH with the capacity to pursue insurance opportunities independently of Mutual, thereby reducing its dependence on Mutual as its only source of business. Mutual retains a share of the risk in MNHs Traditional Business under Mutuals control pursuant to a profit and loss sharing arrangement in the Pooling Agreement based on the loss and LAE experience of the Pooled Business. The Company believes the Pooling Agreement and profit (or loss) sharing feature included therein align the interests of MNH and Mutual. The Pooling Agreement may be terminated by either party at the beginning of any calendar year upon not less than 6 months notice, but not effective before January 1, 2008. Furthermore, the Pooling Agreement may be terminated effective January 1, 2007 upon 6 months notice, but only by MNH and only if the ratio of net losses and LAE to net earned premiums on a cumulative basis from the inception of the Pooling Agreement exceeds 76%, as of the date notice is given. See Administration above. Investments The primary source of funds for investment by the Company is premiums collected. Although premiums, net of commissions and other underwriting costs, are taken into income ratably over the terms of the policies, they provide funds for investment from the date cash is received. Similarly, although establishment of and changes in reserves for losses and LAE are included in results of operations immediately, the amounts so set aside are available to be invested until the Company pays those claims. The investments of the Company are regulated by New Hampshire insurance law and are reviewed by the Board of Directors. Other than certain short-term investments held to maintain liquidity, the Company primarily invests in corporate bonds, mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities including collateralized mortgage obligations, and tax-exempt securities with expected maturities of 10 years or less. 14 Table of Contents The mortgage-backed securities held by the Company are typically purchased at expected yields which are greater than comparable maturity Treasury securities and are AAA or AA rated. The Company had $45,257,000 of tax-exempt bonds in its investment portfolio at December 31, 2005. The Company believes these tax-exempt bonds are of high quality (rated A or better) and, at the time of purchase, offered an after-tax total return potential greater than comparable taxable securities. At December 31, 2005 the Company had $10,650,000 of short-term investments with maturities less than 30 days and $6,123,000 of non-investment grade securities. These non-investment grade securities represented 3% of the investment portfolio as compared to $2,150,000, or 1%, of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2004.

The Company is in direct competition with many national and regional multiple-line insurers, many of which are substantially larger than the Company and have considerably greater financial resources. Competition is further intensified by the independent agency system because each independent agent who sells the Companys policies also represents one or more other insurers. Also, the Companys agents compete with direct writing insurers and this indirectly affects the Company. 16 Table of Contents Historically, the property and casualty industry has tended to be cyclical in nature. During the up cycle, or hard market, the industry is characterized by price increases, strengthening of loss and LAE reserves, surplus growth and improved underwriting results. Near the end of the up cycle, an increase in capacity causes insurance companies to begin to compete for market share on the basis of price. This price competition causes the emergence of the down cycle, or soft market, characterized by a reduction in the premium growth rate and a general decline in profitability. Often times, the down cycle is accompanied by a decline in the adequacy of loss and LAE reserves and a decrease in premium writing capacity. The property and casualty insurance industry experienced a cyclical downturn for most of the 1990s through 2001 due primarily to intense premium rate competition and an excess capacity to write premiums. Beginning in 2002 the property casualty industry experienced price firming primarily within the commercial lines segment. However, some of the circumstances which led to the most recent cyclical downturn in the property and casualty insurance industry have become evident, and the Company believes that this price firming or hard market has ended. Generally, since mid-2004 premium rates have been decreasing due to excess capacity in the industry. Notwithstanding significant losses caused by hurricanes in the southern United States in 2004 and 2005, the Company anticipates that price-based competition will intensify in its markets in 2006. Regulation General MNH is subject to regulation under applicable insurance statutes, including insurance holding company statutes, of the various states in which it writes insurance. Insurance regulation is intended to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect stockholders of insurance companies or their holding companies. Insurance laws of the various states establish regulatory agencies with broad administrative powers including, but not limited to, the power to grant or revoke licenses to transact insurance business and to regulate trade practices, investments, premium rates, the deposit of securities, the form and content of financial statements and insurance policies, accounting practices, the maintenance of specified reserves and capital, and insurers consumer privacy policies. The regulatory agencies of each state have statutory authority to enforce their laws and regulations through various administrative orders, civil and criminal enforcement proceedings, and the suspension or revocation of certificates of authority. In extreme cases, including insolvency, impending insolvency and other matters, a regulatory authority may take over the management and operation of an insurers business and assets. Under insolvency or guaranty laws in the states in which MNH operates, insurers doing business in those states can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses caused by other insurance companies that become insolvent. The extent of any requirement for MNH to make any further payment under these laws is not determinable. Most laws do provide, however, that an assessment may be excused or deferred if it would threaten a solvent insurers financial strength. In addition, MNH is required to participate in various mandatory pools or underwriting associations in certain states in which it operates. The property and casualty insurance industry has been the subject of regulations and legislative activity in various states attempting to address the affordability and availability of different lines of insurance. The regulations and legislation generally restrict the discretion an insurance company has in operating its business. It is not possible to predict the effect, if any, that new regulations and legislation would have on the Company and MNH. 17 Table of Contents The Company depends on cash dividends from MNH to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to meet its expenses. MNH is subject to New Hampshire state insurance laws which restrict its ability to pay dividends without the prior approval of state regulatory authorities. These restrictions limit dividends to those that, when added to all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, would not exceed 10% of the insurers policyholders surplus as of the preceding December 31st. The maximum amount of dividends that MNH could pay during any twelve-month period ending in 2006 without the prior approval of the New Hampshire Insurance Commissioner is $6,639,000. MNH paid $800,0000, $1,200,000, $800,000 and $600,000 of dividends to the Company in February 2005, October 2005, November 2005 and December 2005, respectively. In certain states in which it operates, MNH is required to maintain deposits with the appropriate regulatory authority to secure its obligations under certain insurance policies written in the jurisdiction. At December 31, 2005, investments of MNH having a par value of $850,000 were on deposit with regulatory authorities. MNH is required to file detailed annual reports with the appropriate regulatory agency in each of the states in which it does business. Their business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time, and the laws of many states require periodic examination. The State of New Hampshire Insurance Department most recently examined the accounts of MNH as of December 31, 2003. MNHs annual report as of that date was accepted as submitted, without adjustment. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) applies a risk-based capital measurement formula to all property and casualty insurance companies. The formula calculates a minimum required statutory net worth based on the underwriting, investment, credit, loss reserve and other business risks inherent in an individual companys operations. Any insurance company that does not meet threshold risk-based capital measurement standards could be forced to reduce the scope of its operations and ultimately could become subject to statutory receivership proceedings. MNHs capital substantially exceeds the statutory minimum as determined by the risk-based capital measurement formula as of December 31, 2005. The NAIC has established eleven financial ratios (the Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS) to assist state insurance departments in their oversight of the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. The NAIC calculates these ratios based on statutory information submitted by insurers on an annual basis and shares the information with the applicable state insurance departments. The ratios relate to leverage, profitability, liquidity and loss reserve development. Each of the Companys ratios for 2005 falls within the usual or acceptable range as published by the NAIC. Rates Premium rate regulations vary greatly among states and lines of insurance, but generally require either approval of the regulatory authority or review by the authority prior to changes in rates. Rate filings are based upon an actuarial analysis of historical results and competition in the market. However, in certain states, insurers writing in designated product lines may periodically revise rates within the limits of applicable flexibility bands (flex-bands) on a file and use basis, but must obtain the state insurance departments prior approval in order to implement rate increases or decreases outside these flex-bands. 18 Table of Contents Renewal of Policies Many states restrict the ability of insurers to non-renew insurance policies or to exit a line of business. In particular, New York substantially limits the ability of insurers to non-renew personal automobile insurance. This restricts the Companys ability to mitigate its exposure to the NYAIP. Insurance Holding Companies The Company is subject to statutes governing insurance holding company systems. Typically, these statutes require the Company to file information periodically concerning its capital structure, ownership, financial condition, general business operations and material inter-company transactions not in the ordinary course of business. Under the terms of applicable New Hampshire statutes, any person or entity desiring to purchase shares which would result in such person beneficially owning 10% or more of the Companys outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain regulatory approval prior to the purchase. Involuntary Business As a condition to writing voluntary insurance in most of the states in which it operates, the Company must participate in programs that provide insurance for persons or businesses unable to obtain insurance voluntarily. Uncertainties as to the size of the involuntary market population make it difficult to predict the amount of involuntary business in a given year. Employees The Company and MNH have no employees. At December 31, 2005, Mutual had 313 full-time equivalent employees. The Company believes that Mutuals relationship with its employees is satisfactory. 19 Table of Contents Executive Officers of the Registrant The names of the executive officers of the Company and their ages, titles and biographies as of the date hereof are set forth below.

Item 1.A. RISK FACTORS. The following factors may affect the Companys business. Factors Affecting the Property and Casualty Industry Generally: If our estimates of loss and LAE prove inaccurate and if we have to make even a relatively small adjustment to our reserves, the adjustments may have a significant impact on our income. As discussed in Item 1 BUSINESS, the Company establishes reserves for its estimate of losses and LAE associated with reported and unreported claims for each accounting period. The Company frequently evaluates the adequacy of its reserves and its reserving techniques. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation of incurred losses and LAE, the Company is likely to record increases or decreases to its reserves in current periods for losses and LAE that occurred in prior periods. If an increase in reserves is warranted, the Company would record an increase to its incurred losses and LAE and a reduction to its net income in the period in which the deficiency in reserves is identified. Accordingly, an increase in reserves for losses 20 Table of Contents and LAE could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. The demand for property and casualty insurance is cyclical, which may adversely affect our operating results for extended periods. The property and casualty industry has historically been cyclical in nature. The industry has experienced periods of intense price competition that at times of overcapacity in the industry can result in reduced premium rates. The demand for property and casualty insurance, particularly for commercial products, can vary with the overall level of economic activity . If catastrophic events affect many of our policy holders at the same time, we may experience significant extraordinary losses. The financial results of the Company and those of the property and casualty industry have historically been subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable developments such as natural disasters. Weather-related events such as hurricanes, as well as other natural and unnatural events such as terrorism may adversely affect the financial results of the Company. The frequency and severity of these catastrophes are unpredictable. Although any one year may be free of major weather or other disasters or catastrophes, another year may have several such events, causing results to be materially worse than for other years. The extent of losses resulting from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposures in the affected area and the severity of the event. The Company seeks to mitigate the potential impact of such catastrophes through geographic diversification and through the purchase of reinsurance. Reinsurance recoveries may prove inadequate if a catastrophe were to occur and the cost of the catastrophe were to exceed the amount of reinsurance purchased. Adequate reinsurance may not be available at acceptable prices so that we may not be able to adequately protect the Company against extraordinary losses. As discussed in Item 1 BUSINESS, the Company transfers a portion of the risk associated with the insurance that it sells to reinsurance companies through reinsurance contracts. The availability, amount and cost of such arrangements may vary significantly from year to year depending on market conditions, which include the number and severity of recent natural disasters. Any decrease in the amount of reinsurance purchased by the Company would increase its risk of loss. Furthermore, the Company is exposed to credit risk related to amounts recoverable from reinsurers. Our investment income is very sensitive to prevailing interest rates, and general decreases in interest rates will adversely affect our business. The Company, like other property and casualty insurance companies, depends upon income from its investment portfolio for a significant portion of its revenues and its net income. Most of the Companys investment portfolio is invested in interest bearing securities. Accordingly, a decrease in the general level of interest rates would likely have an adverse effect on the Companys investment income and on its net income. Government regulation affecting casualty and insurance companies could restrict our operations in ways that would adversely affect our business. The Company is subject to regulation under applicable insurance statutes, including insurance holding company statutes, of the various states in which MNH writes insurance. Insurance regulation is intended to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect stockholders of insurance companies or their holding companies. Insurance laws of the various states establish regulatory agencies with broad 21 Table of Contents administrative powers, including the power to grant or revoke licenses to transact insurance business and to regulate trade practices, investments, premium rates and the maintenance of specific levels of capital. The Companys business can be affected adversely by insurance regulations and other regulations affecting property and casualty insurance companies. For example, laws and regulations can set rates at levels that the Company does not believe are sufficient to recover the costs of the risks that it insures. Other laws and regulations can limit the Companys ability to cancel or refuse to renew polices or require the Company to offer coverage to all policy applicants. Federal initiatives such as federal terrorism backstop legislation may also impact the insurance industry. Factors Affecting the Company Specifically: The Companys and MNHs current operations are heavily dependent on their relationships with Mutual, and any disruption of those relationships could adversely affect our business. The Companys and MNHs business and day-to-day operations are closely aligned with those of Mutual. This is the result of a combination of factors. Mutual has had a historical ownership interest in the Company and MNH. At December 31, 2005 Mutual owned 12.0% of the Companys common stock. Under the Services Agreement (see Item 1. BUSINESS), Mutual provides the Company and MNH with all facilities and with personnel to operate their business. The officers of the Company or MNH are employees of Mutual whose services are provided to, and paid for by, the Company and MNH through the Services Agreement. Further, since 2003 the Company and Mutual share underwriting results by means of a reinsurance pooling agreement. The Services Agreement may be cancelled by either party effective January 1, 2008. The Pooling Agreement may be cancelled effective December 31, 2007. If the Services Agreement is terminated the Company will obtain services from an alternate provider or negotiate an extension of the existing Services Agreement. We compete with other regional and national property and casualty insurance companies, many of which have greater resources than we do. The Company competes with many other regional and national property casualty insurance companies, many of which are larger and have greater financial, technical and operating resources. Further, the Company competes with other insurance companies within each agency because each independent agency represents more than one insurance company. If competitors offer better coverage or lower prices, the Companys ability to sell new policies or to renew existing policies may be adversely impacted. Our operations are relatively concentrated in one geographic region, and a large disaster in the states that we serve could adversely affect our business. The Company writes property and casualty insurance business in the northeast and portions of the Midwest United States. Unusually severe storms or natural or man-made disasters that destroy property in these states could have an adverse impact on the Companys financial condition. The Companys revenues and profitability are subject to the prevailing economic conditions in the states in which it writes insurance. New Hampshire state regulations limit our ability to pay dividends even when we have sufficient cash to pay them. As a holding Company, the Company is dependent on cash dividends from MNH to meet its obligations and pay any cash dividends. MNH is subject to New Hampshire insurance laws, which place certain restrictions on its ability to pay dividends without the prior approval of state regulatory authorities. These restrictions limit dividends to those that, when added to all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, would not exceed 10% of the insurers policyholders surplus as of the preceding December 31st. Further, if the New Hampshire Insurance Department were to determine that an MNH dividend to the 22 Table of Contents Company was detrimental to MNHs policyholders, the Department may limit or prohibit dividends that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. Although the Company has a history of paying dividends to its shareholders, future cash dividends will depend on the Companys results of operations, its financial condition, its cash requirements and other factors including MNHs ability to pay dividends to the Company as discussed in the previous paragraph. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to pay dividends to its shareholders even if it has sufficient cash to do so.
