Item 1A. Risk Factors The following factors could materially affect Intevacs business, financial condition or results of operations and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report. The industries we serve are cyclical, volatile and unpredictable. The majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of equipment used to manufacture technology commodity products such as disk drives and our target new markets include other technology commodity markets including semiconductors and photovoltaic (PV) cells. This subjects us to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. When demand for technology commodity products exceeds production capacity, then demand for new capital equipment such as ours tends to be amplified. Conversely, when supply of technology commodity products exceeds demand, then demand for new capital equipment such as ours tends to be depressed. For example, sales of systems for magnetic disk production were severely depressed from mid-1998 until mid-2003 and grew rapidly from 2004 through 2006. The number of new systems delivered declined sequentially in 2007, 2008 and 2009. We cannot predict with any certainty when these cycles will begin or end, although we entered into a downturn in the cycle in late 2007 which continued through 2009. Our equipment represents only a portion of the capital expenditure that our customers incur when they upgrade or add production capacity. Accordingly, our customers generally commit to making large capital expenditures, far in excess of the cost of our systems alone, when they decide to purchase our systems. The magnitude of these capital expenditures requires our customers to have access to large amounts of capital. The magnetic disk and semiconductor manufacturing industries have from time to time made significant additions to their production capacity. Our customers generally reduce their level of capital investment during downturns in the overall economy, or during a downturn in their industries. We must effectively manage our resources and production capacity to meet rapidly changing demand. Our business experiences rapid growth and contraction, which stresses our infrastructure, internal systems and 13 Table of Contents managerial resources. During periods of increasing demand for our products, we must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals; and effectively manage our supply chain. During periods of decreasing demand for our products, we must be able to align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions; motivate and retain key employees and effectively manage our supply chain. Sales of our equipment are primarily dependent on our customers upgrade and capacity expansion plans and whether our customers select our equipment. We have no control over our customers upgrade and capacity expansion plans, and we cannot be sure they will select, or continue to select, our equipment when they upgrade or expand their capacity. The sales cycle for our equipment systems can be a year or longer, involving individuals from many different areas of Intevac and numerous product presentations and demonstrations for our prospective customers. Our sales process also commonly includes production of samples, customization of our product and installation of evaluation systems in the factories of our prospective customers. We do not enter into long-term contracts with our customers, and until an order is actually submitted by a customer there is no binding commitment to purchase our systems. Intevac Photonics business is also subject to long sales cycles because many of its products, such as our military imaging products, often must be designed into the customers end products, which are often complex state-of-the-art products. These development cycles are often multi-year, and our sales are contingent on our customers successfully integrating our product into their product, completing development of their product and then obtaining production orders for their product from the U.S. government or its allies. Sales of new manufacturing systems are also dependent on obsolescence and replacement of the installed base of our customers existing equipment with newer, more capable equipment. If upgrades are developed that extend the useful life of the installed base of systems, then we tend to sell more upgrade products and fewer new systems, which can significantly reduce total revenue. For example, some of our 200 Lean customers continue to use legacy systems for the production of perpendicular media, which delays the replacement of such systems with new 200 Lean systems. Our 200 Lean customers also experience competition from companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory, which offer smaller size, lower power consumption and more rugged designs. If alternative technologies, such as flash memory, replace hard disk drives as a significant method of digital storage, then demand for our hard disk manufacturing products would decrease. We are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base. Historically, a significant portion of our revenue in any particular period has been attributable to sales of our disk sputtering systems to a limited number of customers. In 2009, two of our customers accounted for 55% of total revenues, and four customers in aggregate accounted for 65% of total revenues. The same four customers, in aggregate, accounted for 83% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2009. This concentration of customers can lead to extreme variability in revenue and financial results from period to period. For example, over the last eight quarters, our revenues per quarter have fluctuated between $12.3 million and $34.2 million. Industry consolidation can limit the number of potential customers for our products. For example, Seagate acquired Maxtor in 2006, Western Digital acquired Komag in 2007, and Toshiba acquired Fujitsus hard drive business in 2009. The concentration of our customer base may enable our customers to demand pricing and other terms unfavorable to Intevac, and makes us more vulnerable to changes in demand by a given customer. Orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and will likely continue to account for, a substantial portion of our revenues. The loss of one of these large customers, or delays in purchasing by them, could have a material and adverse effect on our revenues. Our growth depends on development of technically advanced new products and processes. We have invested heavily, and continue to invest, in the development of new products, such as our 200 Lean Gen II system, our Lean Etch system, 200 Lean systems for PV applications and our digital night-vision products. 14 Table of Contents Our success in developing and selling new products depends upon a variety of factors, including our ability to: predict future customer requirements, make technological advances, achieve a low total cost of ownership for our products, introduce new products on schedule, manufacture products cost-effectively including transitioning production to volume manufacturing; commercialize and attain customer acceptance of our products; and achieve acceptable and reliable performance of our new products in the field. Our new product decisions and development commitments must anticipate continuously evolving industry requirements significantly in advance of sales. In addition, we are attempting to expand into new or related markets, including the semiconductor market for our Lean Etch system, and the PV market. To date Intevac has not received revenue from our Lean Etch or PV manufacturing products. Failure to correctly assess the size of the markets, to successfully develop cost effective products to address the markets or to establish effective sales and support of the new products would have a material adverse effect on future revenues and profits. Rapid technological change in our served markets requires us to rapidly develop new technically advanced products. Our future success depends in part on our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products have reliability or quality problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses. Our operating results fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, which can lead to volatility in the price of our common stock. Over the last eight quarters, our quarterly revenues have fluctuated between $12.3 million and $34.2 million and our operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenues has fluctuated between approximately (120.2%) and 12.0% of revenues. Over the same period, the price of our common stock has fluctuated between $3.43 and $17.46 per share. We anticipate that our revenues, operating margins and common stock price will continue to fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including: (1) changes in the demand, due to seasonality, cyclicality and other factors in the markets for computer systems, storage subsystems and consumer electronics containing disks our customers produce with our systems; (2) delays or problems in the introduction and acceptance of our new products, or delivery of existing products; (3) timing of orders, acceptance of new systems by our customers or cancellation of those orders; (4) new products, services or technological innovations by our competitors or us; (5) changes in our manufacturing costs and operating expense; (6) changes in general economic, political, stock market and industry conditions; and (7) any failure of our operating results to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors. Any of these, or other factors, could lead to volatility and/or a rapid change in the trading price of our common shares. In the past, securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any such litigation, if instituted against Intevac, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management. The liquidity of our auction rate securities is impaired, which could impact our ability to meet cash requirements and require additional debt financing. At December 31, 2009, we held auction rate securities (ARS) with a par value of $70.0 million. The market for these securities had historically been highly liquid, even though the ARS that we hold have underlying maturities ranging from 23 to 39 years. The liquidity was achieved through auctions, which occurred every 7 or 28 days depending on the security, in which the interest paid on each security was reset to current market rates. We never intended to hold these securities to maturity, but rather to use the auction feature to sell the securities as needed to provide liquidity. Since February 2008, all of these ARS have failed auction. The ARS will continue to be illiquid until a successful auction process is reinstated, they are restructured into a more liquid security, or a buyer is found outside of the auction process. We do not know when, or if, this will occur. All of the auction rate securities held by us are student loan structured issues, originated under the U.S. Department of Educations Federal Family Education Loan Program with principal and interest 97%  98% reinsured by the U.S. Department of Education. As of December 31, 2009, all of these securities are currently rated investment grade but there is no assurance that 15 Table of Contents these ratings will continue in the future. As of December 31, 2009, securities with a par value of $57.7 million are rated AAA/Aaa, securities with a par value of $9.3 million are rated AAA/A3 and a security with a par value of $3.0 million is rated AAA/Baa3. These securities are classified as long-term investments and we recorded an impairment charge of $3.7 million. If: (1) the issuers of the ARS are unable to successfully resume auctions; or (2) the issuers do not redeem the ARS; or (3) a liquid market for the ARS does not develop; or (4) the U.S. Department of Education fails to support its guaranty of the obligations; or (5) these or any other valuation metrics or processes change, then Intevac may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the ARS and/or record an other-than-temporary impairment charge. On March 19, 2009, Intevac filed a statement of claim under the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority dispute resolution process against Citigroup Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (collectively, Citigroup) with respect to alleged fraud and market manipulation by Citigroup related to ARS. The statement of claim requests that Citigroup accept Intevacs tender of its ARS at par value and that Intevac receive compensatory, consequential and punitive damages and costs and expenses. Citigroup responded denying Intevacs claims. Intevac is currently in the discovery stage of this matter. An arbitration date of May 13, 2010 has been agreed upon for commencement of the arbitration of this dispute. We could incur significant legal costs associated with the legal action and there can be no guarantee our efforts would be successful. In order to increase our liquidity we entered into a line of credit with Citigroup, secured by $55.8 million in par value of our ARS. At December 31, 2009, approximately $18.5 million of credit is available pursuant to the loan facility. This loan facility may be terminated at the discretion of Citigroup and amounts outstanding are payable on demand. If we are unable to maintain this line of credit, or if the interest rate of the line of credit is prohibitive or the amount of the line of credit is insufficient, we could experience difficulties in meeting our cash requirements until the market for the ARS becomes liquid again and we could have to seek additional debt funding to finance our operations, which may not be available on attractive terms, if at all. Adverse economic conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may negatively impact our revenues and our ability to access financing. Economic conditions worldwide have contributed to decreased spending by our customers and a slowdown in the hard disk drive industry. These factors have adversely impacted our operating results in prior periods, including most recently during fiscal 2009, and have caused us to be cautious about our future outlook. Although market conditions improved in the latter half of 2009, market conditions remain volatile and our customers continue to remain cautious. Negative macroeconomic and global recessionary factors, further volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets or further uncertainty or weakening in key markets could negatively impact spending for our products and may materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, while we intend to finance operations with existing cash, cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowing under our existing credit facility, we may require additional financing to support our continued operations. Due to the existing uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, our access to capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. We may be subject to additional impairment charges due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets. As a result of our acquisitions, we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet. We test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis as required, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The events or changes that could require us to test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment include: a reduction in our stock price, and as a result market capitalization, changes in our estimated future cash flows, as well as changes in rates of growth in our industry or in any of our reporting units. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $10.5 million for goodwill due to a decline in our market capitalization and certain purchased technology intangible assets due to lower revenue expectations in light of current operating performance and future operating expectations. We will continue to evaluate the carrying value of our remaining goodwill and intangible assets and if we determine in the future that there is a potential further impairment in any of our reporting units, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings which could materially adversely affect our financial results and could also materially adversely affect our business. See Note 6. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets, Net in the Notes 16 Table of Contents to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. We operate in an intensely competitive marketplace, and our competitors have greater resources than we do. In the market for our disk sputtering systems, we have experienced competition from Anelva Corporation, a subsidiary of Canon, which has sold substantial numbers of systems worldwide. In the market for semiconductor equipment we are attempting to enter a market dominated by competitors such as Applied Materials, LAM Research and Tokyo Electron. Intevac is attempting to enter the PV equipment market, and faces competition from large established competitors including Veeco Instruments, Centrotherm Photovoltaics, Von Ardenne and cell module manufacturers that are internally developing manufacturing equipment that may be sold externally in the future. In the market for our military imaging products we experience competition from companies such as ITT Industries and Fairchild Imaging. In the markets for our commercial imaging products we compete with companies such as Andor, Dalsa, E2V, Hamamatsu, Texas Instruments and Roper Industries for sensor and camera products, and with companies such as Ahura, B&W Tek, GE Security, Horiba-Jobin Yvon, Ocean Optics, Renishaw, Thermo Scientific, and Smiths Detection for Raman spectrometer products. Our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, manufacturing and other resources than we do, especially in the semiconductor equipment market where we have not previously offered a product. We cannot ensure that our competitors will not develop enhancements to, or future generations of, competitive products that offer superior price or performance features. Likewise, we cannot ensure that new competitors will not enter our markets and develop such enhanced products. Moreover, competition for our customers is intense, and our competitors have historically offered substantial pricing concessions and incentives to attract our customers or retain their existing customers. We may not be able to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government permitting delivery of our products to international customers. Many of our products, especially Intevac Photonics products, require export licenses from U.S. government agencies under the Export Administration Act, the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, the Arms Export Act of 1976 or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. These regulations limit the potential market for some of our products. We can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining all the licenses necessary to export our products. Heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for defense related products has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications. Exports to countries that are not considered by the U.S. government to be allies are likely to be prohibited, and even sales to U.S. allies may be limited. Failure to obtain export licenses or delays in obtaining licenses, or revocation of previously issued licenses would prevent us from selling the affected products outside the United States and could negatively impact our results of operations. The Intevac Photonics business is dependent on U.S. government contracts, which are subject to fixed pricing, immediate termination and a number of procurement rules and regulations. We sell many of our imaging products and services directly to the U.S. government, as well as to prime contractors for various U.S. government programs. Our revenues from government contracts totaled $14.8 million, $14.8 million, and $14.1 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Funding of multi-year government programs is subject to congressional appropriations, and there is no guarantee that the U.S. government will make further appropriations, particularly given the U.S. governments recent focus on spending in other areas. Sales to the U.S. government and its prime contractors may also be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations and political developments in the United States or abroad. For example, if the U.S. government is less focused on defense spending or there is a decrease in hostilities, demand for our products could decrease. The loss of funding for a government program would result in a loss of future revenues attributable to that program. The influence of any of these factors, which are beyond our control, could negatively impact our results of operations. A significant portion of our U.S. government revenue is derived from fixed-price development and production contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, unexpected increases in the cost to develop or manufacture a product, whether due to inaccurate estimates in the bidding process, unanticipated increases in material costs, reduced production volumes, inefficiencies or other factors, are borne by us. We have experienced cost overruns in the past 17 Table of Contents that have resulted in losses on certain contracts, and may experience additional cost overruns in the future. We are required to recognize the total estimated impact of cost overruns in the period in which they are first identified. Such cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Generally, government contracts contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the governments convenience upon the payment of compensation only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. We cannot ensure that one or more of the government contracts under which we, or our customers, operate will not be terminated under these circumstances. Also, we cannot ensure that we, or our customers, would be able to procure new government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of any termination of existing contracts, nor can we ensure that we, or our customers, will continue to remain in good standing as federal contractors. As a U.S. government contractor we must comply with specific government rules and regulations and are subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, the results could include: (1) reductions in the value of our contracts; (2) reductions in amounts previously billed and recognized as revenue; (3) contract modifications or termination; (4) the assessment of penalties and fines; and (5) suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently. Changes to our effective tax rate affect our results of operations. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by: (1) changes in tax laws; (2) the allocation of earnings to countries with differing tax rates; (3) changes in worldwide projected annual earnings in current and future years: (4) accounting pronouncements; or (5) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could result in additional payments by Intevac. We booked a significant tax benefit in both 2009 and 2008 based on managements belief that we could both carryback losses to years Intevac paid income taxes and carryforward tax credits to future years where we would generate taxable income. Intevac will need to generate approximately $48 million of taxable income in order to realize the Federal deferred tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2009. If our expectations of future income are incorrect, we could be required to establish a valuation allowance against some or all of the deferred tax assets. Our success depends on international sales and the management of global operations. In 2009, approximately 50% of our revenues came from regions outside the United States. Most of our international sales are to customers in Asia, which includes products shipped to overseas operations of U.S. companies. We currently have manufacturing facilities in California, Wyoming and Singapore and international customer support offices in Singapore, China, and Malaysia. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years. Certain of our suppliers are also located outside the United States. Managing our global operations presents challenges including, but not limited to, those arising from: (1) global trade issues; (2) variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights in different countries; (3) concerns of U.S. governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by growing manufacturing business in Asia; (4) fluctuation of interest rates, raw material costs, labor and operating costs, and exchange rates, including the weakening relative position of the U.S. dollar; (5) variations in the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses; (6) changes in the laws and regulations of the United States, including export restrictions, and other countries, as well as their interpretation and application; (7) the need to provide technical and spares support in different locations; (8) political and economic instability; (9) cultural differences; (10) varying government incentives to promote development; (11) shipping costs and delays; (12) adverse conditions in credit markets; (13) variations in tariffs, quotas, tax codes and other market barriers; and (14) barriers to movement of cash. 18 Table of Contents We must regularly assess the size, capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate changes to address these issues. Our success is dependent on recruiting and retaining a highly talented work force. Our employees are vital to our success, and our key management, engineering and other employees are difficult to replace. We generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees. Further, we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees. The expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel, and has made companies increasingly protective of prior employees. It may be difficult for us to locate employees who are not subject to non-competition agreements and other restrictions. The majority of our U.S. operations are located in California where the cost of living and of recruiting employees is high. Additionally, our operating results depend, in large part, upon our ability to retain and attract qualified management, engineering, marketing, manufacturing, customer support, sales and administrative personnel. Furthermore, we compete with industries, such as the hard disk drive, semiconductor, and solar industries, for skilled employees. Failure to retain key personnel, or to attract, assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future, could have a material and adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent on certain suppliers for parts used in our products. We are a manufacturing business. Purchased parts constitute the largest component of our product cost. Our ability to manufacture depends on the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies from suppliers. We obtain some of the key components and sub-assemblies used in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. If any of our suppliers fail to deliver quality parts on a timely basis, we may experience delays in manufacturing, which could result in delayed product deliveries, increased costs to expedite deliveries or develop alternative suppliers, or require redesign of our products to accommodate alternative suppliers. Some of our suppliers are thinly capitalized and may be vulnerable to failure given recent economic conditions. Our business depends on the integrity of our intellectual property rights. The success of our business depends upon the integrity of our intellectual property rights, and we cannot ensure that: (1) any of our pending or future patent applications will be allowed or that any of the allowed applications will be issued as patents or will issue with claims of the scope we sought; (2) any of our patents will not be invalidated, deemed unenforceable, circumvented or challenged; (3) the rights granted under our patents will provide competitive advantages to us; (4) other parties will not develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents; or (5) our patent rights, intellectual property laws or our agreements will adequately protect our intellectual property or competitive position. From time to time, we have received claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual property rights or seeking to invalidate our rights. We cannot ensure that third parties will not in the future claim that we have infringed current or future patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights relating to our products. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us. We could be involved in litigation. From time to time we may be involved in litigation of various types, including litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights and other claims. For example, in March 2009, Intevac filed a statement of claim under the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority dispute resolution process against Citigroup with respect to alleged fraud and market manipulation by Citigroup related to ARS. The statement of claim requests that Citigroup accept Intevacs tender of its ARS at par value and that Intevac receive compensatory, consequential and punitive damages and costs and expenses. Citigroup responded denying Intevacs claims. Intevac is currently in the discovery stage of this matter. An arbitration date of May 13, 2010 has been agreed upon for commencement of the 19 Table of Contents arbitration of this dispute. Litigation is expensive, subjects us to the risk of significant damages and requires significant management time and attention and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Difficulties in integrating past or future acquisitions could adversely affect our business. We have completed a number of acquisitions during our operating history. For example, in 2007, we acquired certain assets of DeltaNu, LLC and certain assets of Creative Display Systems, LLC and in 2008 we acquired certain assets of OC Oerlikon Balzers Ltd. We have spent and may continue to spend significant resources identifying and pursuing future acquisition opportunities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks including: (1) difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies and products of the acquired companies; (2) the diversion of our managements attention from other business concerns; and (3) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the prior and any future acquisitions or to successfully integrate the operations of the companies we acquire could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities, acquisition- or divestiture-related write-offs or the assumption of debt and contingent liabilities. We use hazardous materials and are subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and safety regulations. We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture, treatment and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous substances, chemicals, materials or waste. If we fail to comply with current or future regulations, such failure could result in suspension of our operations, alteration of our manufacturing process, or substantial civil penalties or criminal fines against us or our officers, directors or employees. Additionally, these regulations could require us to acquire expensive remediation or abatement equipment or to incur substantial expenses to comply with them. Business interruptions could adversely affect our operations. Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster, quarantines or other disruptions associated with infectious diseases, national catastrophe, terrorist activities, war, disruptions in our computing and communications infrastructure due to power loss, telecommunications failure, human error, physical or electronic security breaches and computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. We do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our tools and servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems and tools located at customer sites. Political instability could cause us to incur increased costs in transportation, make such transportation unreliable, increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate. This same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products. In addition, we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for all losses that may occur, and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For example, we self-insure earthquake risks because we believe this is the prudent financial decision based on the high cost of the limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market. An earthquake could significantly disrupt our operations, most of which are conducted in California. It could also significantly delay our research and engineering effort on new products, most of which is also conducted in California. We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by business interruptions, but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful. We are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management must perform evaluations of our internal control over financial reporting. Beginning in 2004, our Form 10-K has included a report by management of 20 Table of Contents their assessment of the adequacy of such internal control. Additionally, our independent registered public accounting firm must publicly attest to the effectiveness of our internal control. We have completed the evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Although our assessment, testing, and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of December 31, 2009, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective, we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods. Ongoing compliance with this requirement is complex, costly and time-consuming. If: (1) Intevac fails to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; (2) our management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal control; or (3) our independent registered public accounting firm does not deliver an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, then we could be subject to: (1) restatement of previously reported financial results, (2) regulatory sanctions and (3) a decline in the publics perception of Intevac, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
