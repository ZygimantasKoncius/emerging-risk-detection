Item 1A. RISK FACTORS OPERATING RISKS AGING OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COULD RESULT IN OUR INABILITY TO COLLECT RECEIVABLES REQUIRING US TO INCREASE OUR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS RESERVE WHICH WOULD DECREASE OUR NET INCOME AND WORKING CAPITAL As our accounts receivable age and become uncollectible our cash flow is negatively impacted. Our accounts receivable from patient accounts (net of allowance for bad debts) were $8,351,314 at June 30, 2010 compared with $6,350,693 at June 30, 2009. As we expand, we will be required to seek payment from a larger number of payors and the amount of accounts receivable will likely increase. Because the behavioral health industry is typically a difficult collection environment, we have focused on better accounts receivable management through increased staff, standardization of some procedures for collecting receivables and a more aggressive collection policy in order to keep the change in receivables consistent with the change in revenue. We have also established a more aggressive reserve policy, allowing greater amounts of reserves as accounts age from the date of billing. If the amount of receivables, which eventually become uncollectible, exceeds such reserves, we could be materially adversely affected. The following chart represents our Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts at June 30, 2010 and 2009 and Bad Debt Expense for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009: Accounts Allowance for Bad Debt Receivable doubtful accounts Expense June 30, 2010 $ 11,353,637 $ 3,002,323 $ 2,131,392 June 30, 2009 $ 8,781,311 $ 2,430,618 $ 1,637,738 NEGATIVE CASH FLOW COULD ARISE AS A RESULT OF SLOW GOVERNMENT PAYMENTS WHICH COULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO BORROW ADDITIONAL FUNDS AT UNFAVORABLE RATES AND AFFECT OUR NET INCOME, WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY The concentration of accounts receivable due from state and federal payors including Medicare and Medicaid (“government payors”) could create a severe cash flow problem should these agencies fail to make timely payment. We had receivables from government payors of approximately $2,333,300 at June 30, 2010 and $1,417,000 at June 30, 2009, which would create a cash flow problem should these agencies defer or fail to make reimbursement payments as due, which would require us to borrow at unfavorable rates or pay additional interest as overline fees on current debt instruments. This would result in lower net income for the same services provided and lower earnings per share. NEGATIVE CASH FLOW COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MEET OBLIGATIONS WHEN DUE WHICH COULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO BORROW ADDITIONAL FUNDS AT UNFAVORABLE RATES AND AFFECT OUR NET INCOME If managed care organizations delay approving treatment, or reduce the patient length of stay number of visits or reimbursement, our Company’s ability to meet operating expenses is affected. As managed care organizations and insurance companies adopt policies that limit the length of stay for substance abuse treatment, our business is materially adversely affected since our revenues and cash flow go down and our fixed operating expenses continue or increase based on the additional resources required to collect accounts receivable. Reimbursement for substance abuse and psychiatric treatment from private insurers is largely dependent on our ability to substantiate the medical necessity of treatment. The process of substantiating a claim often takes up to four months and sometimes longer. As a result, we experience significant delays in the collection of amounts reimbursable by third-party payors, which requires us to increase staff to pursue payment and adversely affects our working capital condition. This causes amounts borrowed on our accounts receivable revolver to remain outstanding for longer periods of time resulting in higher interest expense in addition to the reduced income resulting from the shorter lengths of stay, which combined reduce net income and earnings per sh are. 17 POTENTIAL STAFFING SHORTAGES COULD REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND REDUCE OUR NET INCOME The limited number of healthcare professionals in the areas in which we operate may create staffing shortages. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, particularly skilled health care personnel, which are in short supply. We face competition for such personnel from governmental agencies, health care providers and other companies and are constantly increasing our employee benefit programs, and related costs, to maintain required levels of skilled professionals. As a result of staffing shortages, we use professional placement services to supply us with a pool of professionals from which to choose. These individuals generally are higher s killed, seasoned individuals who require higher salaries, richer benefit plans and in some instances, relocation. We have also entered into contracts with agencies to provide short-term interim staffing in addition to placement services. These additional costs impact our profitability. In December 2004, the Company’s largest inpatient facility voted for UAW representation. Approximately 90% of the staff of the facility are members of the UAW and could vote to strike when the contract comes up for renewal in December 2010. In April 2007, the Company’s largest outpatient operations voted for Teamsters representation. Approximately 26% of the staff of the facility are members of Teamsters and could vote to strike when the contract comes up for renewal in January 2013. A strike vote on the part of either of these operations would negatively impact profitability by requiring the Company to transfer patients to competing facilities or providers or pay high short term staffing rates. This could also ne gatively impact the Company’s reputation in the community creating the need for increased marketing. THE LOSS OF ANY KEY CLIENTS WOULD REDUCE OUR NET REVENUES AND OUR NET INCOME The Company relies on contracts with more than ten clients to maintain patient census at its inpatient facilities and provide patients for our outpatient operations and our employee assistance programs. The loss of any of such contracts would impact our ability to meet our fixed costs. We have entered into relationships with large employers, health care institutions, insurance companies and labor unions to provide treatment for psychiatric disorders, chemical dependency and substance abuse in conjunction with employer-sponsored employee assistance programs. The employees of such institutions may be referred to us for treatment, the cost of which is reimbursed on a per diem or per capita basis. Approximately 20% of our total revenue is derived from these clients. No one of these large employers, health care institutions, insurance companies or labor unions individually accounts for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues, but the loss of any of these clients would require us to expend considerable effort to replace patient referrals and would result in revenue losses and attendant loss in income. GOVERNMENT REGULATION COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND, REDUCE THE ALLOWABLE REIMBURSEMENT TO THE COMPANY AND REDUCE OUR NET INCOME Control of the healthcare industry exercised by federal, state and local regulatory agencies can increase costs, establish maximum reimbursement levels and limit expansion. Our Company and the healthcare industry are subject to rapid regulatory change with respect to licensure and conduct of operations at existing facilities, construction of new facilities, acquisition of existing facilities, the addition of new services, compliance with physical plant safety and land use requirements, implementation of certain capital expenditures, reimbursement for services rendered and periodic government inspections. Governmental budgetary restrictions have resulted in limited reimbursement rates in the healthcare industry, including our Company. As a result of these restrictions, we cannot be certain that payments under government programs will remain at a level comparable to the present level or be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to such patients. In addition, many states, including the State of Michigan, where the majority of our Medicaid Revenue is generated, are experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the recession and are considering reductions in state Medicaid budgets, which may be reflected through more limited access, lower rates, and higher State imposed utilization assessment fees. 18 SOLE SOURCE CONTRACTING BY MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS MAY REDUCE OUR AVAILABLE PATIENTS BY ELIMINATING OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE THEM Insurance companies and managed care organizations are entering into sole source contracts with healthcare providers, which could limit our ability to obtain patients. Private insurers, managed care organizations and, to a lesser extent, Medicaid and Medicare, are beginning to carve-out specific services, including mental health and substance abuse services, and establish small, specialized networks of providers for such services at fixed reimbursement rates. Continued growth in the use of carve-out systems could materially adversely affect our business to the extent we are not selected to participate in such smaller specialized networks or if the reimbursement rate is not adequate to cover the cost of providing the service. ACQUISITION AND EXPANSION COULD RESULT IN NEGATIVE CASH FLOW WHICH COULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO BORROW ADDITIONAL FUNDS AT UNFAVORABLE RATES AND AFFECT OUR NET INCOME If we acquire new businesses or expand our businesses, the operating costs may be far greater than revenues for a significant period of time. The operating losses and negative cash flow associated with start-up operations or acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity unless and until such facilities are fully integrated with our other operations and become self sufficient. Until such time we may be required to borrow at higher rates and less favorable terms to supplement short term operating cash flow shortages. MANAGEMENT RISKS CONTROL OF THE COMPANY PROVIDES THE PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER WITH THE POWER TO APPROVE ALL TRANSACTIONS AND CONTROL THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WITHOUT INPUT OF OTHER SHAREHOLDERS Bruce A. Shear is in control of the Company since he is entitled to elect and replace a majority of the Board of Directors. Bruce Shear and his affiliates own and control 93.1% of the Class B Common Stock, which elects four of the six members of the Board of Directors. Bruce Shear can establish, maintain and control business policy and decisions by virtue of his control of the election of the majority of the members of the board of directors. INABILITY TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL COULD AFFECT OUR CLIENT RELATIONS AND THUS REDUCE OUR REVENUE AND NET INCOME Retention of key personnel with knowledge of key contracts and clients is essential to the success of the Company. PHC is highly dependent on the principal members of its management and professional staff, who are: Bruce A. Shear, PHC’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert H. Boswell, PHC’s Senior Vice President and other members of PHC’s management. We do not anticipate any key member of management will leave the Company but do have a key man life insurance policy on Mr. Shear. 19 MARKET RISKS THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS STOCK PRICE TO BE VOLATILE The market price of the Company’s common stock has been volatile in the past. The shares have sold at prices varying between a low of $0.42 and a high of $2.60 from July 2008 through June 2010. Trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including the following: Ø quarterly variations in operating results; Ø new products, services and strategic developments by us or our competitors; Ø developments in our relationships with our key clients; Ø regulatory developments; and Ø changes in our revenues, expense levels or profitability. PREFERRED STOCK ISSUANCES COULD RESULT IN DIVIDEND, VOTING AND LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES SUPERIOR TO THE COMMON STOCK Our right to issue convertible preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of the common stock. Our Board of Directors has the right to establish the preferences for and issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock without further stockholder action. The terms of any series of preferred stock, which may include priority claims to assets and dividends and special voting rights, could adversely affect the market price of and the ability to sell common stock.
