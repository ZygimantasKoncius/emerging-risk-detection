RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding whether to invest in our American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Additional risks not currently known to us or that we now consider immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition or results of operations and the value of your investment. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of our ADRs could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation including price controls The research, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products are subject to extensive governmental regulation. Governmental regulation includes inspection of and controls over testing, manufacturing, safety and environmental controls, efficacy, labeling, record keeping, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Governmental regulation substantially increases the cost of developing, manufacturing and selling our products. The approval process for new products is generally lengthy, expensive and subject to unanticipated delays. Currently, we are actively pursuing marketing approval for a number of our products from regulatory authorities in a number of countries, including the European Union, the United States and Japan. Continued growth in our revenues and profits will depend, in part, on the timely and successful introduction and marketing of some or all of such products. We cannot give you any assurance as to when or whether such approvals from regulatory authorities will be received. Failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, regulatory clearance to market new products or existing products for new indications, as well as other regulatory actions, could adversely affect our results of operations. Even after a product is approved, it may be subject to regulatory action based on newly discovered facts about the safety or effectiven ess of the product, on any activities which regulatory authorities consider to be improper or on changes in regulatory policy. Regulatory action may adversely affect the marketing of the product, require changes in the product's labeling or even lead to withdrawal of regulatory approval. In addition, in order to obtain (and maintain) marketing authorizations for our products, we must comply with a variety of governmental requirements and we are subject to governmental price-related interventions. These include the requirement to present, in addition to clinical studies proving efficacy, quality and safety of products, studies demonstrating health economic advantages including quality of life, studies proving so-called clinical excellence and submission to price and reimbursement negotiations for already marketed products as well as newly launched products. Governments and major healthcare providers in particular markets are able to exert substantial pressure on market prices. Some governments in Europe, for instance, are exerting strong downward pressure on the prices of the manufacturers by influencing doctors by way of incentives or sanctions to prescribe low cost medicines. The European Commiss ion's efforts to harmonize the disparate national health systems has so far proven not to be successful, leaving the industry exposed to ad hoc national cost containment measures. These measures particularly target manufacturers' prices. As a consequence, parallel trading of products is encouraged as arbitrageurs take advantage of the price differential between those countries where governmental interventions have succeeded in depressing prices and those countries where competitive forces are allowed. Furthermore, central government control of market prices exists in major markets such as Japan and Brazil through limits on the opportunities for financial return and growth in these markets as well as the introduction of new products. In the United States, the products marketed by the Groups subsidiaries are subject to a variety of programs with respect to the reimbursement by federal, state and local government entities for drugs and related products purchased by individuals, who are eligible for certain governmental health benefits. For example, during 2006 new pricing requirements mandated by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 will come into effect. Upon implementation, the U.S. government or the private insurance companies, through which coverage will be offered, could demand discounts through their concentrated purchasing power which could come close to creating price controls on prescription drugs. These trends may adversely affect the Groups revenues and results of operations. In addition, U.S. drug companies are periodically named as defendants in lawsuits brought by government entities and other groups regarding the pri cing of their products for the purpose of government reimbursement. Exchange rate fluctuations could affect our operating result and our ability to price our products competitively Our operations are conducted by entities in many countries and, accordingly, a substantial portion of our sales and production costs are denominated in currencies other than the Euro. As a result, fluctuations between the value of the Euro and other major currencies, in particular the U.S. dollar, the Japanese Yen and the British pound sterling, may affect our operating results. For example, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Euro had a negative impact on the reported sales of our U.S. subsidiaries for inclusion in the Schering AG Group's Consolidated Financial Statements in 2003 and 2004. Moreover, some entities in our Group import and export goods and services in currencies other than their own functional currencies. The results of such entities could therefore be affected by currency fluctuations arising between the transaction dates and the settlement dates for these transactions. We currently hed ge part of these exposures through financial instruments in the form of forward contracts and currency swaps and options. We cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future. In addition, many of our competitors are based in Japan, the United States and other countries whose currencies fluctuate against the Euro. Our business will suffer if we are unable to compensate for any competitive advantage others may derive from having a substantial portion of their costs based in a weaker currency. If our competitors benefit from weaker currencies by offering their products at prices that are lower than ours, we may need to reduce our prices to make our products competitive, lowering our profit margins. A decline in the value of the Euro could reduce the value of your investment and any dividends you receive Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro will affect the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Euro price per ADR and the U.S. dollar value of any cash dividends. If the value of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar declines, the market price of the ADRs is likely to be adversely affected. Any decline in the value of the Euro would also adversely affect the U.S. dollar amounts received by shareholders on the conversion of any cash dividends paid in Euro on the ADRs. Resources devoted to research and development may not yield new products that achieve commercial success Like other pharmaceutical companies, we devote substantial resources to research and development. In the pharmaceutical industry, research and development is both expensive and time-consuming and entails considerable uncertainty. The process of developing a new pharmaceutical product from discovery through testing and registration to initial product launch typically takes between eight and twelve years, but this period varies considerably from product to product and country to country. Because of the complexities and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical research, we cannot assure you that products which we are currently developing will survive the development process and ultimately obtain the regulatory approvals needed to market such products successfully. There can be no assurances regarding the development and commercial success of any of the products in our current pipeline. Moreover, even after a prod uct has received regulatory approval and has been launched, the profile of the product may exhibit unanticipated side effects which could lead to its withdrawal from the market or a significant decrease in the product's sales. We depend on our patents and proprietary rights; several of our patents will expire Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We have been issued numerous patents covering our active substances, pharmaceutical formulations and combinations, manufacturing processes, technologies and products, and have filed, and expect to continue to file, patent applications seeking to protect such newly developed technologies and products. Since many of the products that we sell are licensed to us by third parties, we also rely on the patents held by such third parties. We cannot be sure that patents will be issued with respect to any of our patent applications or that any existing or future patents issued to or licensed by us will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by competitors. We also rely on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation that we seek to protect, in part by confidentiality agreements with licensees, suppliers, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached. We also cannot be certain that we will have adequate remedies for any breach. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our trade secrets and proprietary technology will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors or, if patents are not issued with respect to products stemming from research, that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to such products. We may be required to defend ourselves against charges of infringement of patent or proprietary rights of third parties. Such defense could require us to incur substantial expenses and to divert significant efforts of our technical and management personnel, and could result in our loss of rights to develop or make certain products or require us to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Although patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical product area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. For example, generic drug maker Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Barr Laboratories, Inc. are seeking to market a generic version of Yasmin® prior to the expiration of the Groups patent for this product. We are vigorously defe nding our patent and regulatory position. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on terms we believe to be acceptable. We cannot assure you that an adverse outcome of any dispute with respect to patents or other proprietary rights will not adversely affect our competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. During the period of patent protection, a product is normally only subject to competition from alternative products. Following patent expiration, the manufacturer of the patented product is likely to face increased competition through the entry of generic products into the market and a subsequent decline in market share and sales revenues. Certain of our key products are no longer protected by patents (or other regulatory exclusivity measures) in our major markets, or protection for these products will expire in the near future. For example, the patent protection of our top-selling product, Betaferon® (Betaseron®), expires in 2007 in the United States and 2008 in a number of our key countries in Europe. Betaferon® is a biopharmaceutical. Due to the fact that biopharmaceuticals are defined by their production process, any change in the process can impact safety and efficacy of the product. Therefore, increased regulatory requirements exist for the approval of a generic product for a biopharmaceutical, including the requirement to conduct preclinical or clinical trials. These factors protect us to a certain degree from generic competition, however do not rule out that after patent expiry in key countries in Europe approval will be sought for a generic version of the product. In the U.S., no clear regulatory framework exists for the market authorization of generic versions of biopharmaceuticals, leading us to believe that the effect of the patent expiry on our business, financial condition or results of operations will be limited. Many of our fertility control products have no patent protection remaining. The expiration of certain patents could adversely affect the pricing and sales with respect to these products and, consequently, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our industry is competitive and experiences rapid technological change We compete in the pharmaceutical industry, which is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological change. We compete with companies around the world, including large, well-established pharmaceutical and chemical companies, research and development firms, universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have significant financial, marketing, sales, development and technical resources. Our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective or cheaper than the ones which we may develop. In addition, the continuing consolidation of companies in the pharmaceutical industry might increase competitive pressures as larger suppliers are able to offer a broader product line. We cannot assure you that these developments will not render our technologies and products obsolete and uncompetitive. Delays or unanticipated increases in the costs of development or our failure to obtain regulatory approval or market acceptance for new products and technologies could further adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations. We depend on sales of key products We derived approximately 38% of our net sales in 2005 from sales of four key products: Betaferon®, which is sold in the United States and Canada under the Betaseron® trademark (16% of net sales), Yasmin® (11%), Magnevist® (6%) and Ultravist® (5%). We believe that these key products will constitute a significant portion of net sales for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any factor adversely affecting the sale of these key products individually or collectively could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The sale of these key products could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including manufacturing or supply interruptions, the development of new competitive pharmaceuticals to treat the conditions addressed by the key products, technological advances, factors affecting the cost of production, marketing or pricing actions by one or more of our competitors, changes in prescribing practices, changes in the reimbursement policies of third party payors, product liability claims or other factors. We may incur significant liabilities relating to the sale of our minority interest in Aventis CropScience We may be subject to potential liabilities under the stock purchase agreement for the sale of our minority interest in Aventis CropScience for claims made by Bayer CropScience AG with respect to certain indemnities and representations and warranties, relating mainly to financial statement guarantees, environmental matters, tax liabilities, social contributions and product liabilities. While arbitration proceedings and a number of other claims raised by Bayer CropScience AG in connection with the Aventis CropScience Stock Purchase Agreement were settled in December 2005, there are still several other claims pending from this agreement that might lead to damages. Our liabilities under these claims and other future claims may be significant. Existing insurance coverage may turn out to be inadequate We aim to adequately cover foreseeable risks by insurance. Such insurance coverage, however, may turn out to not fully cover the risks to which the company is exposed. For certain risks, including certain products and product groups, adequate insurance coverage is not available on the market or not at acceptable conditions. Our industry is susceptible to product-related liabilities Like all pharmaceutical companies, we face potential significant risk of loss related to the use of products we market in the United States and in other countries from actions such as lawsuits. We cannot assure you that we can avoid such claims. We also cannot be sure that our product liability insurance will be adequate to cover such claims or that we will be able to get adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs. A successful product liability claim in excess of our coverage could require us to pay substantial sums. Even unsuccessful product liability claims could result in the expenditure of funds in litigation and the diversion of management time and resources and could damage our reputation and impair the marketability of our products. We are currently involved in a number of product liability cases claiming damages as a result of the use of our products. We do not believe, however, that th e potential costs and liabilities associated with such matters are likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. We depend on the services of our key managerial and scientific personnel Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key managerial and scientific personnel, many of whom have many years of experience at the Schering AG Group and would be difficult to replace. Competition for qualified personnel is intense in our industry, and we may not be successful in hiring and retaining people. If we lose the services of any key managerial or scientific personnel or cannot attract and retain other qualified personnel, our business could suffer. ADR holders may not be able to vote or to participate in offerings of new shares If you hold our ordinary shares in the form of ADRs, you generally can exercise your voting rights for the shares which underlie your ADRs only by instructing the depositary how to exercise these voting rights. You may not receive voting materials in time to instruct the depositary how to vote your ADRs, and as a result you may not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote. U.S. holders of ADRs also may not be able to participate in any offer of new shares to existing shareholders on the basis of their subscription rights because of restrictions on the offer and sale of securities in the United States under U.S. securities laws and regulations. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The selected consolidated financial data for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, has been derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The selected consolidated financial data at year end and for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2002, has been derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements not included in this annual report. We prepared our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) of the International Accounting Standards Board, formerly known as International Accounting Standards (IAS). IFRSs differ in certain material respects from United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can read about some of the principal differences in Note 36 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 36 to our Consolidated Financial Statements also provides a reconciliation of our Consolidated Financial Statements to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You should read these selected consolidated financial data together with "Item 5  Operating and Financial Review and Prospects" and our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report.

EXCHANGE RATES Schering AG pays any dividends on its shares in Euro. Furthermore, prices for Schering AG's shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange are quoted in Euro. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Euro and the U.S. dollar will affect: the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Euro price of our shares listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and, as a result, the market price of the ADRs in the United States; the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash dividends on the shares paid in Euro; and our earnings. The noon buying rate for the Euro in The City of New York for cable transfers as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on January 31, 2006, was $1.2158 per €1.00. The following table sets forth the average noon buying rate for the Euro for each of the previous five years: Year Average(1)(U.S.dollar per €1.00) 2001 0.8909 2002 0.9496 2003 1.1360 2004 1.2478 2005 1.2400 (1) Average of the noon buying rates on the last day of each month during the year.

DIVIDENDS Schering AG has paid the following cash dividends in respect of its ordinary shares for the periods indicated. Euro amounts with respect to dividends are translated by the ADR depositary into U.S. dollars on the date of payment April 27, 2001 ($0.8895 per €1.00); April 15, 2002 ($0.8789 per €1.00); April 11, 2003 ($1.0692 per €1.00); April 19, 2004 ($1.2004 per €1.00) and April 15, 2005 ($1.2788 per €1.00). The translation of the proposed 2005 dividend amount into U.S. dollars was performed using the noon buying rate for the Euro on December 30, 2005 ($1.1842 per €1.00).
