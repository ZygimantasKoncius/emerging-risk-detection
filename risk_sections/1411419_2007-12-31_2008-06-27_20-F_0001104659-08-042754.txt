D. Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Peoples Republic of ChinaThe fluctuation of the Renminbi may materially and adversely affect your investment. Inflation and Monetary Risk Inflation in China has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the change in Consumer Price Index in China was 3.9%, 1.8%, 1.5% and 4.8% in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No. 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. SFAS No. 157 does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating whether the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of a companys choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which a company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating whether the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report non-controlling (minority) interests in subsidiaries in the same way as required in the consolidated financial statements. Moreover, SFAS No. 160 eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and non-controlling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. We have not yet begun the process of assessing the potential impact the adoption of SFAS No. 160 may have on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, to improve reporting by creating greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. The standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, except for certain tax adjustments for prior business combinations. Early adoption is prohibited. We have not yet begun the process of assessing the potential impact the adoption of SFAS No. 141R may have on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The standard requires disclosure of fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format as well as cross-referencing within footnotes to enable financial statement users to locate important information about derivative instruments. SFAS No. 161 also provides more information about an entitys liquidity by requiring disclosure of derivative features that are credit risk-related. SFAS No.161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 161 to have a material impact on our financial statements. 99 Item 12. Description of Securities Other than Equity Securities Not Applicable. 100 PART II Item 13. Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies None. Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds The following Use of Proceeds information relates to the registration statement on Form F-1 (File No. 333-147620) (the Registration Statement) for our initial public offering of 6,820,000 ADSs (including 1,364,000 ADSs being sold by certain selling shareholders), for an aggregate offering price of $68,200,000, which Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on December 10, 2007 and was terminated after all of the registered securities were sold. We received net proceeds of approximately $47.8 million from our initial public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders. None of the transaction expenses for the offering included payments to directors or officers of our company or their associates, persons owning more than 10% or more of our equity securities or our affiliates. We have used or intend to use the net proceeds received from our initial public offering for the following purposes: · approximately $10 million to expand our existing lines of business, including the funding of new collaborative alliances with university partners, none of which had been used as of June 23, 2008; · approximately $10 million to develop our own initial network of learning centers, of which approximately $0.1 million has been used as of June 23, 2008 in connection with the opening of nine learning centers; · approximately $15 million to complete the construction of the new campuses at our Jingzhou School (Southern Campus) and Anqing School, of which approximately $1 million has been used as of June 23, 2008; · approximately $735,000 to fund our acquisition of the remaining 20% minority interest in 101 online school, all of which was used as of June 23, 2008; · approximately $3.7 million to repay the loan incurred in connection with the acquisition of the new office building for our headquarters, which amounts are expected to be paid in July 2008; and · the balance of approximately $8.4 million for general corporate purposes, including: · expanding our sales efforts; · opening new offices; and · developing new or enhanced technologies, products and services. As of June 23, 2008, approximately $1.7 million of the net offering proceeds from our initial public offering had been applied. Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., Piper Jaffray & Co. and CIBC World Markets were the underwriters for our initial public offering. Item 15. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our CEO (in her capacity as principal executive officer and interim principal financial officer), has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on such evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 101 Internal Control over Financial Reporting Prior to our initial public offering in December 2007, we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm has not conducted an audit of our internal control over financial reporting. In the course of auditing our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007, our independent registered public accounting firm identified and communicated to us two material weaknesses, two significant deficiencies and certain other control deficiencies, each as defined in Auditing Standard No. 5, in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. Our management agreed with these findings. The material weaknesses identified by our independent registered public accounting firm were: · Inadequate financial reporting and accounting resources with a good understanding of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, reporting requirements. In particular, our independent registered public accounting firm determined that we had insufficient resources in the accounting department to properly analyze transactions and prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have experienced difficulties obtaining timely and consistent financial information from our subsidiaries, and we have limited resources to monitor the accounting policies and financial activities of each subsidiary. As a result, a significant number of audit adjustments have been made to our management financial statements. · The lack of a comprehensive set of accounting policies and procedures in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and inadequate guidance as to how transactions should be accounted for under U.S. GAAP. This has resulted in a significant number of audit adjustments in the past, and can cause material accounting and reporting errors not being detected in a timely manner. The significant deficiencies identified by our independent registered public accounting firm were that we did not have a qualified internal tax team to address our income tax accounting and compliance matters from a U.S. GAAP perspective, and we had certain significant deficiencies with respect to our management information systems. Following the identification of these material weaknesses and significant deficiencies and other control deficiencies, we have taken certain measures to begin to remediate these weaknesses and deficiencies. To begin addressing these weaknesses, we have (i) outsourced, for the time until we are able to perform these functions using our own accounting staff, some of our accounting functions to a third party consultant that employs personnel experienced in U.S. GAAP reporting; (ii) hired two qualified accounting personnel with U.S. GAAP experience; (iii) trained our new and existing accounting staff in U.S. GAAP reporting; (iv) purchased a U.S. GAAP database to ensure that we have timely knowledge of any new update to U.S. GAAP and SEC regulations and that we have a complete database to conduct research for the emerging accounting matters; and (v) hired an internal control director. In addition, we plan to continue to take measures to remediate these weaknesses and deficiencies. However, the implementation of these measures may not fully address these material weaknesses and significant deficiencies and other control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot yet conclude that they have been fully remedied. Our failure to correct these material weaknesses and significant deficiencies and other control deficiencies or our failure to discover and address any other control deficiencies could result in inaccuracies in our financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis. If we fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting. This annual report does not include a report of managements assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of the Companys registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require that we include a report from management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on Form 20-F beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008. 102 Changes in Internal Control Except as set forth above under Internal Control over Financial Reporting, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this annual report on Form 20-F that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. However, we completed our initial public offering in December 2007 and, in connection with being a newly public company, we continue the process of reviewing our polices and procedures on internal control over financial reporting in anticipation of the requirement to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act beginning with our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2008. Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert Our board of directors has determined that Samuel Yen, a member of our audit committee, is an audit committee financial expert as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC.

All audit and non-audit services disclosed in the table above were pre-approved by the audit committee, or the full board of directors in the event such services were pre-approved prior to the formation of the audit committee. 103 Item 16D. Exemptions from the Listing Standards for Audit Committees In accordance with Rule 10A-3(b)(1)(iv)(A)(2) under the Exchange Act, one member of our audit committee, Xiaohong Chen, representing a minority of our audit committee, does not comply with the independence standards contained in Rule 10A-3(b)(1)(ii) under the Exchange Act. As required by Rule 10A-3(b)(1)(iv)(A)(2) under the Exchange Act, within one year from December 10, 2007, the date of the effectiveness of our Registration Statement on Form F-1 (No. 333-147620), all members of are audit committee will comply with the independence standards contained in Rule 10A-3(b)(1)(ii) under the Exchange Act. We do not believe that our reliance on the temporary exemption materially adversely affect the ability of our audit committee to act independently to act independently or to satisfy the requirement of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.

These financial statements and the related financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Groups management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the related financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Group is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits include consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groups internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment. In addition, effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the recognition and measurement methods under Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - An Interpretation of FASB Statement No.109. Our audits also comprehended the translation of Renminbi amounts into United States dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made in conformity with the basis stated in Note 2. Such United States dollar amounts are presented solely for the convenience of the readers. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu CPA Ltd.

To comply with PRC laws and regulations, the Company provides such services in China through its variable interest entities, Xiandai Technology, Hongcheng Education and their subsidiaries. Xiandai Technology was established by two of the Companys former directors on November 7, 2000, and it holds certain Internet content provider licenses and operates the website www.chinaedu.net on behalf of the Group. The initial capital contributions from the two former directors were obtained from Hongcheng Technology in the form of non-interest bearing loans totaling RMB600. The loans were eliminated upon consolidation. A summary of the key terms in the loan agreements and the related pledge agreements is as follows: (i) Proceeds from the loans are to be used solely for the investments in Xiandai Technology; (ii) The loans can only be repaid by a transfer of the equity ownership interest in Xiandai Technology to Hongcheng Technology; (iii) Ownership interest in Xiandai Technology cannot be transferred to other parties without the approval of Hongcheng Technology; (iv) Hongcheng Technology has the right to appoint all directors and senior management personnel of Xiandai Technology; (v) All ownership rights, including voting rights and rights to declare and pay dividends, are assigned to Hongcheng Technology for an indefinite term; and (vi) Hongcheng Technology has the right to acquire all of the ownership interests in Xiandai Technology at any time, when permitted by the PRC law.

ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES - continued Hongcheng Education was established on March 7, 2005 by one of the Companys management personnel and a former director of the Company, and it holds certain education licenses on behalf of the Group. The initial capital contributions from the two equity owners were obtained from the Company in the form of non-interest bearing loans totaling RMB54,200. The loans were eliminated upon consolidation. A summary of the key terms in the loan agreements and the related pledge agreements is as follows: (i) Proceeds from the loans are to be used solely for the investments in Hongcheng Education; (ii) The loans can only be repaid by a transfer of the equity ownership interest in Hongcheng Education to the Company; (iii) Ownership interest in Hongcheng Education cannot be transferred to other parties without the approval of the Company; (iv) The Company has the right to appoint all directors and senior management personnel of Hongcheng Education; (v) All ownership rights, including voting rights and rights to declare and pay dividends, are assigned to the Group for an indefinite term; and (vi) The Company has the right to acquire all of the ownership interests in Hongcheng Education at any time, when permitted by the PRC law. The Group had elected to adopt Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (revised) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities-an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46R) from its inception. Through the contractual agreements described above, both Xiandai Technology and Hongcheng Education are considered to be variable interest entities in accordance with FIN 46R because the equity owners lack the ability to make decisions about Xiandai Technology and Hongcheng Educations activities that have a significant effect on their success and substantially all of Xiandai Technology and Hongcheng Educations businesses are conducted on behalf of Hongcheng Technology and the Company, respectively. Under the Technical Consulting and Services Agreements, Hongcheng Technology has the sole discretion to charge Xiandai Technology and Hongcheng Education fees that represent substantially all of the variable interest entities net income. In addition, the Company has assumed all of the voting rights of both the board of directors and shareholders of Hongcheng Education, and Hongcheng Technology has assumed all of the voting rights of both the board of directors and shareholders of Xiandai Technology. The assumption of these rights gives the Company and Hongcheng Technology the rights to declare and pay dividends or other forms of distribution. Since the Company is the sole variable interest holder of Hongcheng Education, and Hongcheng Technology is the sole variable interest holder of Xiandai Technology, the Company and Hongcheng Technology are the primary beneficiaries of such variable interest entities. Furthermore, because Hongcheng Technology and the Company are the primary beneficiaries of Xiandai Technology and Hongcheng Education, respectively, the accounts and operations of Xiandai Technology and Hongcheng Education are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements effective as of the date of the above agreements.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued Term deposits Term deposits consist of deposits placed with financial institutions with original maturity terms of greater than three months but less than one year. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Groups financial statements include the allowance of doubtful debts, the useful lives and impairment of property and equipment, land use rights, and intangible assets with definite lives; valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets; purchase price allocation relating to the businesses acquired; share-based compensation; valuation of convertible notes; and the related detachable warrants. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Land use rights, net Land use rights are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, which is generally 50 years and represents the shorter of the estimated usage periods or the terms of the agreements. Property and equipment, net Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Assets under construction are not depreciated until they are ready for their intended use. Depreciation and amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: Buildings 20 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3-5 years Motor vehicles 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives F-11 CHINAEDU CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2006 AND 2007 (In thousands, except share-related data) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued Intangible assets, net Intangible assets consist of copyrights, customer base, software platform, contractual rights and prepaid operating contracts, and are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the contractual terms or the expected useful lives of the acquired assets. The weighted average amortization periods by major intangible assets class is as follows: Service agreements with universities and high schools 35 years Operating platform 6 years Customer base 4 years Online courseware 2 years Agency agreements 5 years Contractual rights 10 years Prepaid operating contracts 22 years Management has determined that the Groups trade names do not have determinable useful lives. Consequently, the carrying amounts of trade names are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Such impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair values of the trade names with their carrying amounts and an impairment loss is recognized if and when the carrying amounts of the trade names exceed their fair values. The estimates of fair values of intangible assets not subject to amortization are determined using various discounted cash flow valuation methodologies. Significant assumptions are inherent in this process, including estimates of discount rates. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets. No impairment of indefinite life intangible assets was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. Impairment of long-lived assets The Group reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may no longer be recoverable. When these events occur, the Group measures impairment by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Group would recognize an impairment loss based on the fair value of the assets. The Company did not record any impairment loss during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. F-12 CHINAEDU CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2006 AND 2007 (In thousands, except share-related data) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated at least annually for impairment following a two-step process. The first step compares the fair values of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. Management performed the annual goodwill test as of December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007 and no impairment losses were recorded in 2005 and 2006. In 2007, based on the impairment assessment performed by management, the Company incurred a goodwill impairment charge of RMB16,192. This impairment charge relates to the Friendly Experimental Class program (the FEC program), as management has significantly adjusted downward the profitability forecast for this portion of the Companys business. The Company expects future net revenue from the FEC program to be lower than the Company had previously forecast as a result of lower student numbers and lower per student amounts payable to the Company under its contractual arrangements with participating schools. These developments are the result of increased competition, increased bargaining power of the schools participating in the program and the Companys expansion of the program into less affluent areas of China, where tuition fees tend to be lower. In addition to these charges, the Company expects that these developments will adversely affect the future financial results for the FEC program. The fair values of the reporting units were established using a combination of expected present value of future cash flow and income approach valuation methodology. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 were as follows: Online Primary private Online International degree and secondary tutoring curriculum program schools program program Total RMB RMB RMB RMB RMB Balance as of January 1, 2006 12,860 1,250 14,926 32,171 61,207 Goodwill acquired during the year    15,302 15,302 Balance as of December 31, 2006 12,860 1,250 14,926 47,473 76,509 Goodwill acquired during the year  674  12,328 13,002 Goodwill impairment during the year    (16,192 ) (16,192 ) Balance as of December 31, 2007 12,860 1,924 14,926 43,609 73,319 F-13 CHINAEDU CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2006 AND 2007 (In thousands, except share-related data) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued Revenue recognition The Groups revenue is principally derived from four primary sources: (i) the provision of bundled online education technical and consulting services; (ii) the provision of traditional classroom education services; (iii) the provision of online tutoring services; and (iv) the licensing of online education technology platform and courseware for online education purposes. Revenue is recognized when earned and is reported net of business taxes, which totaled RMB4,350, RMB6,247 and RMB7,354 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. (i) Online education technical and consulting services The Groups primary business is to provide online education technical and consulting services to the online degree programs of leading Chinese universities. These services include academic program development, technology services, enrollment marketing, student support services, and finance operations. Since each of the services does not have a stand-alone value to the universities, these services are accounted for as one unit of accounting and the related revenue is recognized ratably over the service period. The Group primarily hosts the online education technology on its system and provides access to the universities to whom the Group provides services and their students. Any universities that prefer hosting the online education platform or courseware on their own systems must enter into separate arrangements with the Group (see revenue recognition note (iv) below). The Group receives service fees from the universities each semester covering services to be provided to the universities during that semester. The amount of service fees to be received by the Group is derived from tuition fees collected by the universities from their students at the beginning of each semester, as adjusted for the universities costs and expenses, such as refunds to students, fees to other service providers, and other operating costs and expenses. Fees received are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue ratably over the six-month school semester during which the Group provides the services. The semesters generally begin in April and October of each calendar year. The Group does not provide services directly to the students and does not have obligations to the students.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued Revenue recognition - continued (ii) Traditional classroom education services The Group operates a number of private primary and secondary schools, and markets and supports international post-secondary and English language curriculum programs to established learning institutions. Fees from private and secondary schools operations are initially recorded as deferred revenue at the time the students register for their classes and the Group receives payments. Students must register and pay for their classes at the beginning of each semester. Revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, which is six months for each school semester, as the education services are delivered. If a student withdraws from a class, any collected but unearned portion of the fee is recognized at that time unless the student is entitled to a refund under limited circumstances. For the international post-secondary and English language curriculum programs, students must register and pay for their classes at the beginning of each semester. Fees collected from the provision of teaching and other support services to the learning institutions are recognized either when such services are provided, or on a straight-line basis over the service period, which is typically the six-month school semester. (iii) Online tutoring services The Group offers online interactive tutoring services to primary and secondary students. These services allow the customers access to the online education services over a fixed period of time, generally ranging from one month to three years, through the use of prepaid cards. The prepaid cards are sold to distributors, from whom the Group collects payments when the prepaid cards are delivered to the distributors. The distributors then resell the cards to end users. All prepaid fees received from distributors are initially recognized as deferred revenue and revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable period that the Group provides services.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued Revenue recognition - continued (iv) Licensing of online education technology platform and courseware The Group licenses its online education technology platform and courseware to universities and other education companies and also provides post contract customer support (PCS), which includes telephone support and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if available basis. The Group recognizes revenue from licensing of online education technology platform and courseware when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery of the services has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. As the Group does not have vendor-specific objective evidence to establish the fair values of the undelivered elements, the Group recognizes revenue from the licensing of online education technology platform and courseware over the PCS period, which is typically 12 months. Revenue from the licensing of the online education technology network platform and courseware also includes the rebate of value-added taxes. The value-added taxes rebate program is part of the PRC governments strategy to encourage high technology development in the PRC. Since the Group cannot estimate when or if a rebate will be provided by the PRC taxing authorities, rebates are recorded as a component of revenue when received and are not subject to future return or reimbursement. Rebates received by the Group during 2005, 2006, and 2007 were RMB1,094, RMB1,669, and RMB2,405, respectively. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable relate to the online education technical and consulting services provided to certain university customers. Accounts receivable are recorded at amounts that are presently due based on the service agreement, which are net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company writes off accounts receivable when it becomes apparent based upon age or customer circumstances that such amounts will not be collected. Cost method investment For investment in an investee over which the Group does not have significant influence, the Group carries the investment at cost and recognizes income as any dividends received from the distribution of the investees earnings. The Group reviews the cost investment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may no longer be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the investments cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made. The fair value of the investment would then become the new cost basis of the investment. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued Concentration of credit risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, term deposits, and accounts receivable. The Group places its cash and cash equivalents and term deposits with financial institutions with high-credit ratings and quality. The Group conducts credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral or other security from them. To date, the Group primarily collects fees for its services up front and has not experienced significant losses from uncollectible accounts. Therefore, no allowance for doubtful accounts was established as of December 31, 2006 and 2007. Management of the Group will continue to evaluate the Groups collection experience and will provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts as appropriate. A summary of the customers who accounted for 10% or more of the Groups consolidated net revenues was as follows: Years ended December 31, Customers 2005 2006 2007 RMB RMB RMB A 33,332 39,947 55,965 B 25,715 32,522 37,075 C * * * D * 39,643 45,926 E 14,056 * * A summary of the customers who accounted for 10% or more of the Groups consolidated accounts receivable was as follows: December 31, Customers 2006 2007 % % A 17 32 B 21 21 C 29 32 D * * E 14 * F * 11 * Represented less than 10% of consolidated revenue or accounts receivable balances.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued Research and development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related costs associated with the development of online education technology platform and courseware. The Group expenses all research and development costs when incurred. Advertising costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Group incurred advertising costs totaling RMB1,552, RMB4,704 and RMB5,575 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively, which were recorded as a component of selling and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Royalty fees Royalty fees payable to a middle school increase each year from the 2005 calendar year to the 2024 calendar year. Royalty fees during this period were aggregated and recognized as royalty expense on a straight-line basis. The difference between royalty fees paid and the amount reported as expenses was included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency translation The functional currency of the Company, BJ-BCIT and BJ-WITT is the US$. The functional currency of the Group, excluding the Company, BJ-BCIT and BJ-WITT, is the RMB. Transactions in other currencies are recorded in each relevant entitys functional currency at the rates of exchange prevailing when the transactions occur. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated into the applicable functional currencies at rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into the applicable functional currencies at historical exchange rates and transactions dominated in other currencies are converted at the applicable rates of exchange prevailing when the transactions occur. Exchange gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The Groups reporting currency is the RMB. Currency translation involves translating from the functional currency of PRC entities of RMB into the Companys functional currency of US$ followed by a translation from US$ to the reporting currency of RMB. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date, equity amounts are translated at historical exchange rates and revenues, expenses, gains, and losses are translated using the average rate for the year. Translation adjustments are reported as cumulative translation adjustments and are shown as a separate component of other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued Foreign currency risk The RMB is not a freely convertible currency. The State Administration for Foreign Exchange, under the authority of the Peoples Bank of China, controls the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies. The value of the RMB is subject to changes in central government policies and to international economic and political developments affecting supply and demand in the China Foreign Exchange Trading System market. Cash and cash equivalents and term deposits of the Group included aggregate amounts of RMB158,315 and RMB171,831 at December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, which were denominated in RMB. Income taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, net of operating loss carry forwards and credits, by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities. On January 1, 2007, the Group adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was RMB4,332 as of December 31, 2007. The Group recognized RMB3,744 accumulated impact to accumulated deficits as of January 1, 2007. The Group recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense, and the Group recognized RMB499 and RMB89 of accrued interest and penalties, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2007. The Company is subject to taxation in China and other foreign jurisdictions. Comprehensive income (loss) Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income and foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive income (loss) is reported as a component of the consolidated statements of shareholders equity. Fair value of financial instruments Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, term deposits, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long term debt, convertible notes, and amounts due from and due to related parties. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, term deposits, accounts receivable, and amounts due from and to related parties approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities. The fair values of the convertible notes as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 were RMB31,112 (US$4,027) and RMB nil, respectively, determined based on the incremental borrowing rate discounted by using the effective interest method.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued Net income (loss) per share The Group had determined that its convertible preferred shares were participating securities as the preferred shares participate in undistributed earnings on an as-if-converted basis. The holders of the preferred shares were entitled to receive dividends on a pro rata basis, as if their shares had been converted into ordinary shares. Accordingly, the Group used the two-class method of computing net income (loss) per share, for ordinary and preferred shares according to participation rights in undistributed earnings. Under this method, net income applicable to holders of ordinary shares was allocated on a pro rata basis to the ordinary and preferred shares to the extent that each class may share income for the period; whereas undistributed net loss was allocated to ordinary shares because preferred shares were not contractually obligated to share the loss. To calculate the number of shares for diluted net income (loss) per share, convertible preferred shares were computed using the if-converted method. The convertible preferred shares, convertible notes, options and warrants, which could potentially dilute basic net income per share in the future, were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share for the year ended December 31, 2005 as their effects would have been antidilutive. Share-based compensation The Group grants stock options to its employees and directors. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Group accounted for employee share-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB Opinion 25), and its related interpretations, which required the Group to record a compensation charge for the excess of the fair value for the ordinary shares at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the ordinary shares. The compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable service period, which is usually the vesting period. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123R, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25. Effective January 1, 2006, the Group adopted SFAS No. 123R and recognized compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period which is the vesting period. The Group used the prospective method. Under this method, share-based compensation expense recognized includes: (a) compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, January 1, 2006, based on the intrinsic value as of the grant date; and (b) compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards granted on or subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on grant-date fair value.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued Recently issued accounting standards In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No. 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. SFAS No. 157 does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 delays the effective date of Statement 157 for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Group is currently evaluating whether the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a significant effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of a companys choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which a company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. The Group is currently evaluating whether the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a significant effect on its consolidated results of operations and financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No. 51 to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report noncontrolling (minority) interests in subsidiaries in the same way as required in the consolidated financial statements. Moreover, SFAS No. 160 eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Group has not yet begun the process of assessing the potential impact the adoption of SFAS No. 160 may have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. F-22 CHINAEDU CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2006 AND 2007 (In thousands, except share-related data) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued Recently issued accounting standards - continued In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141(R), Business Combinations, to improve reporting by creating greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. The standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, except for certain tax adjustments for prior business combinations. Early adoption is prohibited. The Group has not yet begun the process of assessing the potential impact the adoption of SFAS No. 141R may have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The standard requires disclosure of fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format as well as cross-referencing within footnotes to enable financial statement users to locate important information about derivative instruments. SFAS No. 161 also provides more information about an entitys liquidity by requiring disclosure of derivative features that are credit risk-related. SFAS No.161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. The Group does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 161 to have a material impact on its financial statements. 3. ACQUISITIONS During the periods from 2005 to 2007, in order to enhance its leading online degree education service offerings, and to diversify its service offerings under the private primary and secondary schools, online tutoring, and international curriculum programs, the Group consummated the acquisitions set forth below. These transactions were recorded using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. F-23 CHINAEDU CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2006 AND 2007 (In thousands, except share-related data) 3. ACQUISITIONS - - continued (a) In January 2005, Hongcheng Liye acquired an 80% equity interest in Gotop Electronic and Beijing Xuezhi from Tianjin Tianxingjian Education Co., Ltd.

The Equity Incentive Plan allows the Group to offer a variety of incentive awards to employees and non-employee directors of the Group and any consultant who performs services for the Group. Pursuant to the Equity Incentive, an incentive option (ISO) may only be granted to employees and a non-qualified option may be granted to employees, non-employee directors and consultants.

Under the terms of this Equity Incentive Plan, the exercise price for an ISO shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the grant date. However, in the case of an incentive option granted to a grantee who at the time of grant owned shares possessing more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of the Companys share capital (including any equity of any of the Companys Chinese subsidiaries), the option price may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of the ordinary shares on the date of grant of such ISO and the option period may not be greater than five years from the date of grant. The minimum option vesting period for any option grant is three years and acceleration of option vesting is not permitted, unless approved by the Board of Directors.

INCOME TAXES - continued During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, if the Companys subsidiaries and variable interest entities in the PRC had not been awarded tax holidays or received special tax concessions, provision for income taxes, net (loss) income, and net (loss) income per share would have been as follows: Years ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Increase in provision for income taxes 5,684 25,251 18,006 Net (loss) income (8,534 ) 288 (15,519 ) Net (loss) income per ordinary share-basic (0.53 ) 0.00 (0.37 ) Net (loss) income per preferred A share-basic  0.00  Net (loss) income per preferred B share-basic  0.00  Net (loss) income per preferred C share-basic  0.00  Net (loss) income per preferred D share-basic  0.00  Net (loss) income per ordinary share-diluted (0.53 ) 0.00 (0.37 ) The principal components of the Groups deferred income tax assets were as follows: December 31, 2006 2007 RMB RMB Current deferred tax assets Deferred revenue 5,347 9,521 Net current deferred tax assets 5,347 9,521 Non-current deferred tax assets Intangible assets 1,961 1,273 Deferred revenue 96 143 Net operating loss carryforwards 672 399 Total non-current deferred taxes 2,729 1,815 Less: valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (672 ) (399 ) Total non-current deferred taxes 2,057 1,416 Non-current deferred tax liabilities Property and equipment 1,168 774 Intangible assets 18,711 23,262 Total deferred tax liabilities 19,879 24,036 F-40 CHINAEDU CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2006 AND 2007 (In thousands, except share-related data) 12. INCOME TAXES - continued The Group has net operating loss carryforwards of RMB1,596 from the PRC subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2007, which will expire on various dates from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2007, a valuation allowance of RMB399 was provided against deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss carryforwards of certain PRC subsidiaries and variable interest entities due to the uncertainty of realization. Adjustments will be made to the valuation allowance if events occur in the future that indicate changes in the amount of deferred tax assets that may be realized. The Group operates through multiple subsidiaries and variable interest entities and the valuation allowances are considered separately for each subsidiary and variable interest entity. The Group does not file consolidated tax returns, therefore, losses and deferred taxes from one subsidiary or a variable interest entity may not be used to offset another subsidiary or variable interest entitys earnings or deferred taxes. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with early adoption permitted. As a result of the Groups adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was RMB4,332 as of December 31, 2007. The Group recognized RMB3,744 accumulated impact to accumulated deficits as of January 1, 2007. The Group has adopted the accounting policy that interest recognized in accordance with paragraph 15 of FIN48 and penalties recognized in accordance with paragraph 16 of FIN 48 are classified as part of its income taxes. RMB499 interest and RMB89 penalties were recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Balance at January 1, 2007 3,744 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year  Additions for tax positions of prior years  Reductions for tax positions of current year  Audit Settlement paid in current year  Other - interest and penalty 588 Balance at December 31, 2007 4,332 F-41 CHINAEDU CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2006 AND 2007 (In thousands, except share-related data) 12. INCOME TAXES - continued The Company is subject to taxation in China and other foreign jurisdictions. There are no ongoing examinations by taxing authorities at this time. The Companys various tax years from 2002 to 2007 are remaining open in various taxing jurisdictions. The Group does not anticipate any significant change within 12 months of this reporting date of its uncertain tax positions. On March 16, 2007, the National Peoples Congress adopted the Enterprise Income Tax Law (the New Income Tax Law), which became effective January 1, 2008 and replaced the existing separate income tax laws for domestic enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises, which are PRC subsidiaries of the Group, by adopting unified income tax rate of 25% for most enterprises. In accordance with New Income Tax Law, the existing preferential tax treatments granted to certain subsidiaries of the Company, because it is qualified as a high and new technology enterprise may continue to be entitled as long as they continue to qualify as a high and new technology enterprise strongly supported by the State. Pursuant to the issuance of Circular 172, which was issued on April 14, 2008 (GuoKeFaHuo 2008 No. 172), in order for applicant enterprises to be classified as high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State certain requirements must be met, such as ownership of the core intellectual property, products or services within State-Encouraged High Technology Areas. However, as the procedures for obtaining classification as high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State have not yet been finalized, they cannot assure you that any of their subsidiaries or affiliated companies currently enjoying preferential tax rates will be approved as high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the State entitled to preferential tax treatments. Furthermore, under the New Income Tax Law, a resident enterprise, which includes an enterprise established outside of the PRC with management located in the PRC, will be subject to the PRC income tax. If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine that the company and its subsidiaries registered outside PRC should be deemed a resident enterprise, the Company and its subsidiaries registered outside the PRC will be subject to the PRC income tax at a rate of 25%. The Company expects that the applicable subsidiaries will apply for the New and High Technology Enterprise status that will allow them to apply a 15% tax rate under Chinas Unified Enterprise Income Tax Law. Under applicable accounting rules, until these subsidiaries receive official approval for this status, they must use the statutory 25% tax rate in their calculation of their deferred tax balances. If these subsidiaries receive approval, then their present net deferred tax balances of RMB13,099 would change to RMB8,231. The change in the tax rate would have resulted in a RMB4,868 decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2007. The difference would be an increase to these subsidiaries profit and loss accounts in the period in which approval is received.

INCOME TAXES - continued Reconciliation between total income tax expense and the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes is as follows: Years ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 % % % Statutory rate 33 33 33 Tax holiday (52 ) (45 ) (42 ) Effect on tax rates in different tax jurisdiction 36 3 7 Permanent book-tax differences 17 20 27 Changes in valuation allowance 2 1  Increased in unrecognized tax benefit   1 Effect of new tax law   9 Effective tax rates 36 12 35 Under the New Income Tax Law that became effective January 1, 2008, the rules for determining whether an entity is resident in the PRC for tax purposes have changed and the determination of residence depends on, among other things, the place of actual management. If the Group, or any of its non-PRC subsidiaries, were to be determined to be a PRC resident for tax purposes, it, or they, would be liable to tax in the PRC on worldwide income, including the income arising in jurisdictions outside the PRC. The Group is still evaluating its resident status under the New Income Tax Law and related guidance. If the Group were to be non-resident for PRC tax purposes, dividends paid to it out of profits earned after January 1, 2008 would be subject to a withholding tax. In the case of dividends paid by PRC subsidiaries to their foreign investors, the withholding tax would be 10%, unless any such foreign investors jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. Aggregate undistributed earnings of the Groups subsidiaries and VIEs located in the PRC that are available for distribution to the Group of approximately RMB3,334 at December 31, 2007 are considered to be indefinitely reinvested under APB opinion No. 23, and accordingly, no provision has been made for the Chinese dividend withholding taxes that would be payable upon the distribution of those amounts to the Group. The Chinese tax authorities have also clarified that distributions made out of pre January 1, 2008 retained earnings will not be subject to the withholding tax. The Group does not have any present plan to declare or pay any cash dividends on its ordinary shares or ADSs in the foreseeable future. The Group currently intends to retain most, if not all, of its available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of its business. As of December 31, 2007, the Group had not declared or paid any dividends on its ordinary shares or ADSs.

Under the treasury stock method, the proceeds from the assumed conversion of options and warrants are used to repurchase outstanding ordinary shares using the average fair value for the period. The Group has determined that its convertible preferred shares are participating securities as the preferred shares participate in undistributed earnings on an as-if-converted basis. The holders of the preferred shares are entitled to receive dividends on a pro rata basis, as if their shares had been converted into ordinary shares. Accordingly, the Group uses the two-class method of computing net income per share, for ordinary and preferred shares according to participation rights in undistributed earnings.

NET (LOSS) INCOME PER SHARE - continued For 2005, 2006, and 2007, the Group had the following securities outstanding, which could potentially dilute basic net income per share in the future, but were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share in 2005, 2006 and 2007 as their effects would have been antidilutive: Years ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Preferred A shares 5,150,000   Preferred B shares 12,140,495   Preferred C shares 3,378,379   Outstanding employee options to purchase ordinary shares 9,026,050   Outstanding warrants to purchase ordinary shares 2,376,408   14. LONG-TERM DEBT During 2007, the Group purchased office space for RMB55,773, including RMB26,430 pursuant to a mortgage loan from a commercial bank. In December 2007, the Group committed to pay the remaining RMB25,724 of amounts outstanding under the loan in the next five years. 15. CONVERTIBLE NOTES In July and August 2005, in conjunction with the issuance of Series C convertible preferred shares (Series C preferred shares), the Company issued two convertible notes (Convertible Notes) of RMB30,188 (US$3,750) to the Series C preferred shareholders. The Convertible Notes bear an interest rate of 8% per annum commencing on the anniversary date of issuance payable annually in arrears. The Convertible Notes are due and payable in full in July and August 2008, respectively. All of the outstanding principal and accrued interests are due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of an event of default. Fifty percent of the principal amount and all accrued interest are due and payable automatically upon the closing of a qualified initial public offering (IPO) and the remaining 50% are due and payable automatically on the one year anniversary date of the closing of an IPO. The unpaid principal and accrued interest are convertible into Series C preferred shares only in the event of the Companys default under the terms of the Convertible Notes. The default events include insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation and other material adverse changes to the Company. In the event of a conversion, the conversion price would be $1.85 per share.

CONVERTIBLE NOTES - continued In conjunction with the issuance of the Series C convertible preferred shares and the Convertible Notes, the Company also issued to the Series C preferred shareholders a stock purchase warrant providing for the rights to purchase 608,108 ordinary shares of the Company at the purchase price of US$1.85 per share. The stock purchase warrant expires five years from the date of grant. The proceeds received in the Series C convertible preferred shares and convertible notes offerings were allocated between the convertible instruments and the warrants on a relative fair value basis. The difference between the allocated value of the Convertible Notes and the face value was recorded as a debt discount, which was amortized over the note term using the effective interest rate method. The amount of interest expense recorded resulting from the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature totaled RMB667 and RMB693 for the periods ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. In March 2007, the Group repaid part of the Convertible Notes of RMB5,808 (US$750) in principal and RMB393 in accrued interest by the issuance of 83,488 Series D preferred shares and the cash payment of RMB3,151. A gain of RMB394 arising from the extinguishment of the Convertible Note was recorded as part of other income. In addition, as a result of the early conversion of this portion of the Convertible Notes, the related beneficial conversion feature associated with the converted portion of the Convertible Notes totaling RMB133 was immediately recognized as an interest expense during the six months ended June 30, 2007. In December 2007, the Group repaid the remaining part of Convertible Notes of RMB22,650 (US$3,099) in principal and accrued interest by cash payment. 16. CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES In August 2000 and 2001, the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred shares for RMB49,669 (US$6,000) before issuance costs of RMB547 (US$66). In December 2004, the Company Repurchased 2,000,000 Series A convertible preferred shares from one of the shareholders for a total price of US$2,160 (RMB17,881). The Company issued 300,000 Series A preferred shares in September 2007 at $1.00 per share upon the exercise of a warrant. In December 2004, the Company issued 12,140,495 Series B convertible preferred shares to certain investors for total proceeds of RMB137,310 (US$16,590), before issuance costs of RMB4,467 (US$573). In conjunction with the issuance of Series B convertible preferred shares, the Company also issued detachable warrants to certain investors for no additional consideration. As per the warrant agreement, these investors could purchase an aggregate of 1,768,300 ordinary shares at a per share exercise price of RMB12.2 (US$1.48). The proceeds received in the Series B convertible preferred share offerings were allocated between the convertible instrument and the warrants on a relative fair value basis. For certain investors, the issuance price was US$1.31 (an equivalent of RMB10.88). When the detachable warrants are taken into consideration and after a portion of the issuance price was allocated to the warrants, the issuance price of Series B preferred shares decreased to US$1.25 (an equivalent of RMB10.51), which was lower than the issuance price for other investors by US$1.48 (an equivalent of RMB12.25). Such difference was recorded as a deemed dividend in the amount of RMB15,959. In July 2007, the Company repurchased 30,000 Series B preferred shares in July 2007, in each case, at $2.81 per share.

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES - continued The Group has determined that there was no embedded beneficial conversion feature attributable to the Series B convertible preferred shares because the initial effective conversion price of Series B preferred shares equaled to the issuance price and was higher than the fair value of the Companys ordinary shares determined based on an independent valuation. In July 2005, the Company issued 3,378,379 shares of Series C convertible preferred shares to certain investors for total proceeds of RMB50,312 (US$6,250), before issuance costs of RMB928 (US$115).

In conjunction with the issuance of convertible notes, the Company also issued detachable warrants to the investors for no additional consideration. As per the warrant agreements, these investors could purchase up to 608,108 ordinary shares at a per share exercise price of RMB14.89 (US$1.85). The proceeds received in the Series C convertible preferred shares and convertible notes offerings were allocated between the convertible instruments and the warrants on a relative fair value basis. The Company has determined that there was no embedded beneficial conversion feature attributable to the Series C convertible preferred shares because the initial effective conversion price of Series C preferred shares equaled to the issuance price and was higher than the fair value of the Companys ordinary shares determined based on an independent valuation.

In July 2007, the Company issued 630,000 Series D preferred shares at a price of US$3.85 per share to additional investors. Each Series D preferred share is convertible at the option of the holder at any time after the issuance of such shares, or is automatically converted at the consummation of a qualified IPO. Each Series D preferred share is convertible into one ordinary share of the Company. Each Series D preferred share is entitled to the same voting rights as each ordinary share. From January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2022, the Series D preferred shareholders are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at 12.5% of the original issue price. In the event of liquidation, Series D preferred shareholders will receive a liquidation distribution in preference to any distribution to the holders of Series A, B, and C preferred shares and ordinary shareholders at an amount that equals the original issuance price plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. Each Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D convertible preferred share has been automatically converted into one ordinary share upon the qualified IPO on December 14, 2007.

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES - continued The significant terms of the above Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D convertible preferred shares were as follows: Conversion Each Series A, Series B, Series C and D convertible preferred share was convertible into one ordinary share of the Company at the option of the holder at any time after the issuance of such shares, or is automatically converted in a qualified IPO. The conversion ratio was subject to standard anti-dilutive adjustments such as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalization. Voting rights The Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D shareholders had the voting rights determined based on the equivalent number of the Companys ordinary shares into which their preferred shares were convertible. Dividends The holders of the preferred shares were entitled to receive dividends on a pro rata basis, as if their shares had been converted into ordinary shares. From January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2022, the Series B convertible preferred shareholders would be entitled (if not previously converted) to receive cumulative dividends at a rate of 12.5% of the original issuance price per share per annum. From January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2022, both the Series C and D convertible preferred shareholders would be entitled (if not previously converted) to receive cumulative dividends at a rate of 12.5% of the original issuance price per share per annum. No dividend will be paid to the Companys ordinary shareholders and Series A preferred shareholders until all Series B, C, and D preferred share dividends have been paid in full. Once the Series B, C and D preferred shareholders have been fully satisfied, all preferred shareholders were entitled to any additional dividends declared and are payable to the ordinary shareholders on an as-if-converted basis. Liquidation preference In the event of liquidation, Series D preferred shareholders would have received a liquidation distribution in preference to any distribution to the holders of Series A, B, and C preferred shares and ordinary shareholders at an amount that equals to the original issuance price plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. Any remaining funds after satisfying the Series D preferred shareholders were first to be paid to the Series C preferred shareholders, then the Series B preferred shareholders, and finally, the Series A preferred shareholders, in that order. The amounts to be paid would have been equal to the aggregate original purchase price plus any declared but unpaid dividends adjusted for any stock split, stock dividends and recapitalizations. Redemption rights The preferred shares were not redeemable at the option of the holders.

WARRANTS In conjunction with the issuance of the convertible notes in 2002, the Company also issued to the convertible notes holder a stock purchase warrant providing for the rights to purchase 300,000 shares of Series A preferred shares of the Company at US$1 per share. The stock purchase warrant will expire five years from the date of grant. The fair value and the allocated value of the warrants were approximately RMB1,452 (US$175) and RMB1,235 (US$149) at the grant date, respectively.

MAINLAND CHINA CONTRIBUTION PLAN AND PROFIT APPROPRIATION Full time employees of the Group in the PRC participate in a government-mandated multi-employer defined contribution plan pursuant to which certain pension benefits, medical care, unemployment insurance, employee housing fund and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. Chinese labor regulations require the Group to accrue for these benefits based on certain percentages of the employees salaries. Total provisions for such employee benefits were RMB8,070, RMB8,267 and RMB14,659for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. 19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (a) Pursuant to the contract signed between Hongcheng Technology and another university, Hongcheng Technology has committed to contribute RMB35,000 for the use of the universitys education resources. As of December 31, 2007, the remaining commitment is approximately RMB5,000, which is expected to be paid within the next two years. (b) Pursuant to the contract signed between Hongcheng Education and a middle school for the use of the schools education resources, Hongcheng Education has committed to pay a royalty fee of RMB1,000 per annum from 2008 to 2010, and RMB1,200 per annum from 2011 to 2024. The aggregate of the fees committed through 2024 were recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis with the difference between the amount paid and the amount recognized reported as deferred commitment fees, a component of RMB1,313. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, the amounts reported as expenses were RMB1,088 during both periods. The amounts recorded as deferred commitment fees as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 were RMB874 and RMB1,313, respectively. (c) The Group leases certain office premises under non-cancelable operating leases through 2011. Rent expenses under operating leases for 2005, 2006, and 2007 were RMB6,406, RMB7,264, and RMB9,088, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases agreements are as follows: Years ending December 31, RMB 2008 6,971 2009 3,828 2010 2,965 2011 1,227 2012 723 15,714 (d) As of December 31, 2007, the Group had commitments totaling RMB141,434 for the expansion of the schools in Anqing and Jingzhou, which included capital commitment for the on-going construction in progress was RMB19,827 as of December 31, 2007. All the capital commitments are expected to be paid within the next two years. (e) In November 2007, one of the Groups former employees threatened to take legal action against the Group in respect of options for the purchase of the ordinary shares that he claims to own. This former employee, who sold the FEC and the BCIT programs to the Group in 2005 and 2006, respectively, worked in the business unit responsible for those programs until his departure from the Group in May of 2007. He claims to own options to purchase 140,000 of the Companys shares, 60,000 exercisable at $1.26 per share and 80,000 exercisable at $1.58 per share. Although 140,000 share options were granted to him under the Companys share option plan, at the time of his departure from the Company, only 46,667 of these options had vested. Under the agreements governing the share option plan, he was required to exercise those vested options within 30 days of leaving the Group, which he did not do. Consequently, the Group does not believe that his claim in respect of these options has any merit and its impact on the results of operations cannot be estimated.

STATUTORY RESERVES PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by the Companys PRC subsidiaries only out of their retained earnings, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Prior to payment of dividends, pursuant to the laws applicable to the PRCs Foreign Investment Enterprises, the Companys subsidiaries and variable interest entities in the PRC must make appropriations from after-tax profit to non-distributable reserve funds as determined by the Board of Directors of each company. These reserves include a (i) general reserve, and (ii) enterprise expansion reserve. F-55 CHINAEDU CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2006 AND 2007 (In thousands, except share-related data) 22. STATUTORY RESERVES - continued Subject to certain cumulative limits, the general reserve requires annual appropriations of 10% of after-tax profits (as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the PRC (PRC GAAP) at each year-end); the other reserve appropriations are at the Companys discretion. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes of enterprise expansion and staff bonus and welfare and are not distributable as cash dividends. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, the Companys PRC subsidiaries and variable interest entities made appropriations to the general reserve of RMB2,776, RMB nil and RMB7,540 respectively. The PRC subsidiaries and variable interest entities elected not to make any appropriations to the enterprise expansion reserve in any of the years presented. As a result of these PRC laws and regulations, the PRC subsidiaries are restricted from transferring a portion of their net assets to the Company. 23. RESTRICTED NET ASSETS Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations restrict the payments of dividends by the Companys PRC subsidiaries and variable interest entities from their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, general reserve (see Note 22) requires annual appropriations of 10% of after-tax profit should be set aside prior to the payment of dividends. As a result of these PRC laws and regulations, the Companys PRC subsidiary and variable interest entities are restricted in their abilities to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, the amounts of restricted net assets were approximately RMB176,650 and RMB227,995, respectively. 24.
