ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information contained in this Form 10-K. The risks we face are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Readers are cautioned that the risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K are not the only ones facing Empire. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not presently aware of, or that we currently consider immaterial, may also affect our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations (including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock) could suffer if the concerns set forth below are realized. We are exposed to increases in costs and reductions in revenue which we cannot control and which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The primary drivers of our electric operating revenues in any period are: (1) rates we can charge our customers, (2) weather, (3) customer growth and (4) general economic conditions. Of the factors driving revenues, weather has the greatest short-term effect on the demand for electricity for our regulated business. Mild weather reduces demand and, as a result, our electric operating revenues. In addition, changes in customer demand due to downturns in the economy could reduce our revenues. The primary drivers of our electric operating expenses in any period are: (1) fuel and purchased power expenses, (2) maintenance and repairs expense, including repairs following severe weather and plant outages, (3) taxes and (4) non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expense. Although we generally recover these expenses through our rates, there can be no assurance that we will recover all, or any part of, such increased costs in future rate cases. The primary drivers of our gas operating revenues in any period are: (1) rates we can charge our customers, (2) weather, (3) customer growth, (4) the cost of natural gas and interstate pipeline transportation charges and (5) general economic conditions. Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon weather patterns throughout our natural gas service territory and a significant amount of our natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating seasons. Accordingly, our natural gas operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are warmer in the winter. The primary driver of our gas operating expense in any period is the price of natural gas. Significant increases in electric and gas operating expenses or reductions in electric and gas operating revenues may occur and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 Table of Contents We are exposed to factors that can increase our fuel and purchased power expenditures, including disruption in deliveries of coal or natural gas, decreased output from our power plants, failure of performance by purchased power counterparties and market risk in our fuel procurement strategy. Fuel and purchased power costs are our largest expenditures. Increases in the price of coal, natural gas or the cost of purchased power will result in increased electric operating expenditures. Given we have a fuel cost recovery mechanism in all of our jurisdictions, our net income exposure to the impact of the risks discussed above is significantly reduced. However, cash flow could still be impacted by these increased expenditures. We are also subject to prudency reviews which could negatively impact our net income if a regulatory commission would conclude our costs were incurred imprudently. We depend upon regular deliveries of coal as fuel for our Riverton, Asbury, Iatan and Plum Point plants. Substantially all of this coal comes from mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and is delivered to the plants by train. Production problems in these mines, railroad transportation or congestion problems, or unavailability of trains could affect delivery cycle times required to maintain plant inventory levels, causing us to implement coal conservation and supply replacement measures to retain adequate reserve inventories at our facilities. These measures could include some or all of the following: reducing the output of our coal plants, increasing the utilization of our gas-fired generation facilities, purchasing power from other suppliers, adding additional leased trains to our supply system and purchasing locally mined coal which can be delivered without using the railroads. Such measures could result in increased fuel and purchased power expenditures. We have also established a risk management practice of purchasing contracts for future fuel needs to meet underlying customer needs and manage cost and pricing uncertainty. Within this activity, we may incur losses from these contracts. By using physical and financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk and market risk. Market risk is the exposure to a change in the value of commodities caused by fluctuations in market variables, such as price. The fair value of derivative financial instruments we hold is adjusted cumulatively on a monthly basis until prescribed determination periods. At the end of each determination period, which is the last day of each calendar month in the period, any realized gain or loss for that period related to the contract will be reclassified to fuel expense and recovered or refunded to the customer through our fuel adjustment mechanisms. Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty might fail to fulfill its obligations under contractual terms. We may be unable to recover increases in the cost of natural gas from our natural gas utility customers, or may lose customers as a result of any price increases. In our natural gas utility business, we are permitted to recover the cost of gas directly from our customers through the use of a purchased gas adjustment provision. Our purchased gas adjustment provision is regularly reviewed by the MPSC. In addition to reviewing our adjustments to customer rates, the MPSC reviews our costs for prudency as well. To the extent the MPSC may determine certain costs were not incurred prudently, it could adversely affect our gas segment earnings and cash flows. In addition, increases in natural gas costs affect total prices to our customers and, therefore, the competitive position of gas relative to electricity and other forms of energy. Increases in natural gas costs may also result in lower usage by customers unable to switch to alternate fuels. Such disallowed costs or customer losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are subject to comprehensive regulation by federal and state utility regulatory agencies, which significantly influences our operating environment and our ability to recover our costs from utility customers. The utility commissions in the states where we operate regulate many aspects of our utility operations, including the rates that we can charge customers, siting and construction of facilities, pipeline 18 Table of Contents safety and compliance, customer service and our ability to recover costs we incur, including capital expenditures and fuel and purchased power costs. The FERC has jurisdiction over wholesale rates for electric transmission service and electric energy sold in interstate commerce. Federal, state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over many of our other activities. Information concerning recent filings requesting increases in rates and related matters is set forth under Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Â— Rate Matters." We are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from the regulatory activities of any of these agencies. Despite our requests, these regulatory commissions have sole discretion to leave rates unchanged, grant increases or order decreases in the base rates we charge our utility customers. They have similar authority with respect to our recovery of increases in our fuel and purchased power costs. If our costs increase and we are unable to recover increased costs through base rates or fuel adjustment clauses, or if we are unable to fully recover our investments in new facilities, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Operations risks may adversely affect our business and financial results. The operation of our electric generation, and electric and gas transmission and distribution systems involves many risks, including breakdown or failure of expensive and sophisticated equipment, processes and personnel performance; operating limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions, environmental or other regulatory requirements; fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions; transmission scheduling constraints; and catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, severe weather or other similar occurrences. In addition, our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to internal or external cyber attack, unauthorized access, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems or misuse our confidential information. We have implemented training and preventive maintenance programs and have security systems and related protective infrastructure in place, but there is no assurance that these programs will prevent or minimize future breakdowns, outages or failures of our generation facilities or related business processes. In those cases, we would need to either produce replacement power from our other facilities or purchase power from other suppliers at potentially volatile and higher cost in order to meet our sales obligations, or implement emergency back-up business system processing procedures . These and other operating events may reduce our revenues, increase costs, or both, and may materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Currently, our corporate credit ratings and the ratings for our securities are as follows: Fitch Moody's Standard & Poor's Corporate Credit Rating n/r* Baa2 BBB- EDE First Mortgage Bonds BBB+ A3 BBB+ Senior Notes BBB Baa2 BBB- Commercial Paper F3 P-2 A-3 Outlook Stable Stable Stable *Not rated. 19 Table of Contents The ratings indicate the agencies' assessment of our ability to pay the interest and principal of these securities. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The lower the rating, the higher the interest cost of the securities when they are sold. In addition, a downgrade in our senior unsecured long-term debt rating would result in an increase in our borrowing costs under our bank credit facility. If any of our ratings fall below investment grade (investment grade is defined as Baa3 or above for Moody's and BBB- or above for Standard & Poor's and Fitch), our ability to issue short-term debt, commercial paper or other securities or to market those securities would be impaired or made more difficult or expensive. Therefore, any such downgrades could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any actual downgrade of our commercial paper rating from Moody's or Fitch, may make it difficult for us to issue commercial paper. To the extent we are unable to issue commercial paper, we will need to meet our short-term debt needs through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, which may result in higher costs. We cannot assure you that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. We are subject to environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation with regard to air and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, new environmental laws and regulations, and new interpretations of existing environmental laws and regulations, have been adopted and may in the future be adopted which may substantially increase our future environmental expenditures for both new facilities and our existing facilities. Compliance with current and future air emission standards (such as those limiting emission levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2), emissions of mercury, other hazardous pollutants (HAPS), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and, potentially, carbon dioxide (CO2)) has required, and may in the future require, significant environmental expenditures. Although we have historically recovered such costs through our rates, there can be no assurance that we will recover all, or any part of, such increased costs in future rate cases. The incurrence of additional material environmental costs which are not recovered in our rates may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The cost and schedule of construction projects may materially change. Our capital expenditure budget for the next three years is estimated to be $470.2 million. This includes expenditures for environmental upgrades to our existing facilities and additions to our transmission and distribution systems. There are risks that actual costs may exceed budget estimates, delays may occur in obtaining permits and materials, suppliers and contractors may not perform as required under their contracts, there may be inadequate availability, productivity or increased cost of qualified craft labor, start-up activities may take longer than planned, the scope and timing of projects may change, and other events beyond our control may occur that may materially affect the schedule, budget, cost and performance of projects. To the extent the completion of projects is delayed, we expect that the timing of receipt of increases in base rates reflecting our investment in such projects will be correspondingly delayed. Costs associated with these projects will also be subject to prudency review by regulators as part of future rate case filings and all costs may not be allowed recovery. 20 Table of Contents Financial market disruptions may increase financing costs, limit access to the credit markets or cause reductions in investment values in our pension plan assets. We estimate our capital expenditures to be $147.2 million in 2012. Although we believe it is unlikely we will have difficulty accessing the markets for the capital needed to complete these projects (if such a need arises), financing costs could fluctuate. Our pension plan and Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB) costs increased, resulting in an $8.8 million increase in our 2010 net pension and OPEB liability. During 2011, our net pension and OPEB liability increased $8.2 million. We expect to fund approximately $14.3 million in 2012 for pension and OPEB liabilities. Future market changes could result in increased pension and OPEB liabilities and funding obligations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
