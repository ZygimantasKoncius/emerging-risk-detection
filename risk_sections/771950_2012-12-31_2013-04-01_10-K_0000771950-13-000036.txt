Item 1A. Risk FactorsAn investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risk factors below should be read in conjunction with other information contained in this report as our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks actually occur.Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.Our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 were prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that we will continue in operation and be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As described in more detail below, our operating revenue in 2012, in particular in the fourth quarter, was significantly below our financial projections for such period, which had a significant adverse effect on our results from operations and resulted in a net loss of $146,692 for the year ended December 31, 2012, including a goodwill impairment of $92,194. We also encountered significant liquidity issues and without the amendments and waivers from our lenders, which allowed us to pay the interest on our Second Lien Credit Agreement in kind and the deferral of certain vendor payables, we would not have had sufficient liquidity to operate our business. As a result, we entered into several amendments and limited waivers to our existing Credit Agreements to avoid breaching certain covenants 9and other obligations under such agreements and made certain interest payments in kind, instead of in cash. If our recapitalization does not close in mid-April as anticipated, absent additional waivers and amendments, we will default under our Credit Facilities, which defaults if left uncured, will allow our lenders to declare all our outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable and pursue all available remedies available to them under our Credit Agreements and at law. Further, even if our recapitalization does close as expected, we must generate sufficient cash flow from operations to support our daily operations as well as provide sufficient resources to retire existing liabilities and obligations on a timely basis. If our results do not meet our financial projections, we cannot ensure that we will be able to satisfy our new (post-recapitalization) covenants over the next twelve months or have sufficient liquidity to meet our payment obligations to our lenders and other third parties. As a result of the foregoing, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.While we have entered into amendments and temporary limited waivers with the lenders under our Credit Facilities with respect to certain historical instances of non-compliance and certain expected instances of non-compliance through April 16, 2013, we currently anticipate that we will breach certain provisions of our Credit Facilities in the future, including certain of our financial ratio covenants for the quarters ending June 30, 2013 and beyond, if we do not satisfy or obtain waiver of the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the New Credit Agreements (as hereinafter defined) and other transaction documents. In the event of such breaches, we would default under our existing Credit Facilities, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business continuity and our financial condition if our lenders exercised their available remedies under the underlying debt instruments and the law.As discussed above and elsewhere in this report, our operating results significantly underperformed against our financial projections in 2012, particularly in the fourth quarter. On November 15, 2012, December 14, 2012, January 15, 2013 and February 28, 2013, we entered into amendments and limited waivers with the lenders under our Credit Facilities, which, among other things, had the effect of waiving for a limited period of time certain historical non-compliance and certain expected instances of non-compliance with certain covenants thereunder. Such included the obligation to comply with our debt leverage and interest coverage covenants as of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2012, the last date on which such covenants were measured in 2012, our obligation to comply with our debt leverage and interest coverage covenants as of March 31, 2013, and in the case of the Second Lien Credit Agreement, the obligation to make the $2,824 interest payment due on November 9, 2012 in cash was amended to be payable in kind. In the absence of such amendments and limited waivers, we would have breached these and certain other covenants and obligations. Our obligation under the Second Lien Credit Agreement to make an interest payment of $2,981 on February 11, 2013 was also amended to be payable in kind. Such non-compliance was a result of several factors, including our 2012 results from operations. Such results were adversely impacted by late cancellations by advertisers that were greater than previous years and closer to air date than in previous periods; competitive factors, such as a greater diversity of digital ad platforms (into which ad budgets have flowed) and increased competition from our major competitors; and advertisers' response to controversial statements by a certain nationally syndicated talk radio personality in March 2012.Based on our current financial projections, we currently anticipate that we will breach certain of our financial ratios (including our debt leverage and interest coverage covenants) for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 and that we may have insufficient liquidity to make all required interest and amortization payments under our Credit Facilities during future periods. The latter will largely depend on whether we are able to “reverse course” and contrary to 2012, meet our financial projections for 2013. On February 28, 2013, we entered into the A&R First Lien Credit Agreement and the A&R Second Lien Credit Agreement which amend and restate our existing Credit Facilities and provide permanent waivers of certain of the non-compliances mentioned above with respect to the First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement. In addition, we also entered into the Priority Second Lien Credit Agreement and certain other transaction documents. However, the effectiveness of the A&R First Lien Credit Agreement, the A&R Second Lien Credit Agreement, the Priority Second Lien Credit Agreement and other transaction documents are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the respective conditions precedent set forth therein, including the absence of a material adverse effect since January 15, 2013 (other than those based on facts previously disclosed to the lenders prior to February 28, 2013), on Tuesday, April 16, 2013. For further detail regarding the February 28, 2013 transactions, including the New Credit Facilities entered into in connection therewith, please refer to Note 17 — Subsequent Event to the Consolidated Financial Statements.There can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy or obtain waiver of the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the A&R First Lien Credit Agreement, the A&R Second Lien Credit Agreement, the Priority Second Lien Credit Agreement and the other transaction documents. As a result, it is possible that such agreements will not become effective, the temporary waivers of the non-compliances mentioned above with respect to the First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement will be terminated, such non-compliances will become events of default under the Credit Facilities at such time and we will not be in compliance with the terms of the Credit Facilities in future periods, which would result in an event of default under the Credit 10Facilities. If such an event of default occurs, there can be no assurance that the lenders under the Credit Facilities will grant us a waiver on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In the event of any such event of defaults under our Credit Facilities which remain uncured, our lenders could declare all outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable and pursue their remedies under the underlying debt instruments and the law. In the event of such acceleration or exercise of remedies, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance the accelerated debt on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, as is common for commercial contracts in our industry, certain of our material programming agreements could be terminated by counterparties in the event of our insolvency or of certain defaults under our Credit Facilities. As a result, if an event of default under the Credit Facilities occurs and results in an acceleration of the Credit Facilities, a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations would likely result or we may be forced to (1) attempt to restructure our indebtedness, (2) cease our operations or (3) seek protection under applicable state or federal laws, including but not limited to, bankruptcy laws. We have significantly increased the amount of our indebtedness and have limited liquidity, which could adversely affect our operations, flexibility in running our business and our ability to service our debt if our future operating performance does not improve. On February 28, 2013, we entered into the A&R First Lien Credit Agreement and the A&R Second Lien Credit Agreement which amend and restate our existing Credit Facilities and provide permanent waivers of certain of the non-compliances mentioned above with respect to the First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement. We also entered into the Priority Second Lien Credit Agreement and certain other transaction documents. As described in Note 17 — Subsequent Event to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the effectiveness of the A&R First Lien Credit Agreement, the A&R Second Lien Credit Agreement, the Priority Second Lien Credit Agreement and other transaction documents are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the respective conditions precedent set forth therein, including the absence of a material adverse effect since January 15, 2013 (other than those based on facts previously disclosed to the lenders prior to February 28, 2013), on or before Tuesday, April 16, 2013. As described in more detail in the next risk factor, notwithstanding the paydown or cancellation of $78,000 of existing first lien and second lien obligations as part of such recapitalization, should such close, we will continue to have a substantial amount of first lien and second lien obligations, including $31,500 of additional new second lien obligations.At the time of the Merger, we entered into a $155,000 First Lien Credit Agreement; an $85,000 Second Lien Credit Agreement, and a $25,000 revolving credit facility which was nearly fully drawn as of December 31, 2012 (including $20,000 of borrowed funds and $4,976 in letters of credit used as security on various leased properties and issued thereunder) (collectively our "Credit Facilities"). We also issued $30,000 in aggregate principal amount of PIK Notes (which had accrued PIK interest in the amount of $5,774 as of December 31, 2012). As of December 31, 2012, we had a total of $285,975 of indebtedness ($151,125 under the First Lien and $87,824 under the Second Lien), net of the unamortized original issue discount of $8,748. Our ability to service our debt for the next twelve months in accordance with its current terms is uncertain and depends on our future financial performance and ability to satisfy the waivers and conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the recapitalization and the New Credit Facilities as described in Note 17 — Subsequent Event to the Consolidated Financial Statements below. Our Credit Facilities include, and will continue to include upon the effectiveness of the New Credit Facilities mentioned herein, in addition to our financial covenants, substantial non-financial covenants, including one that restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness beyond certain minimal baskets. If our operating results continue not to meet our earnings objectives or decline further and we are unable to raise new sources of liquidity (whether through additional indebtedness or an issuance of equity), we will lack sufficient liquidity to operate our business in the ordinary course or service our debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were then unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations under our Credit Facilities, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our Credit Facilities, which if uncured, would allow our lenders to declare all outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable and would materially impair our financial condition and liquidity.Even after the recapitalization of our existing indebtedness, we will have substantial indebtedness and may not have sufficient income or liquidity to support such level of indebtedness, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business continuity and liquidity. Upon the effectiveness of the New Credit Facilities entered into in connection with the February 28, 2013 transactions mentioned herein, there will be (1) a $15,000 paydown of our existing First Lien Term Loan Facility $5,000 was paid on February 28, 2013 and Revolving Credit Facility (leaving a principal balance of approximately $137,800 of outstanding term loans and approximately $18,200 of outstanding revolving loans), (2) a restructuring of approximately $93,000 in second lien obligations which includes (A) the continuation of a $30,000 term loan (issued in two tranches) that matures five years after the expected closing of the recapitalization and (B) the exchange of approximately $63,000 in remaining obligations under the existing Second Lien Term 11Loan Facility for a new series of our preferred stock (leaving a principal balance in second lien obligations of approximately $30,000), and (3) the issuance of $31,500 of new term loans under the Priority Second Lien Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding the paydown or cancellation of $78,000 of existing first lien and second lien obligations, we will continue to have a substantial amount of first lien and second lien obligations (approximately $200,733), including $31,500 of additional new second lien obligations and additional second lien obligations accruing from time to time when interest under the A&R Second Lien Credit Agreement is required to be capitalized and added to the principal balance when the conditions to pay cash interest are not satisfied. Interest is payable in cash on loans under the A&R Revolving Credit Facility and A&R First Lien Term Loan Facility at a rate equal to Eurodollar Base Rate (as defined below) or the base rate, plus an applicable margin, generally as selected by us. Presently, the all-in rate for Eurodollar rate loans is 8% (Libor floor of 1.5% plus applicable margin of 6.5%) and for base rate loans is 8.75% (prime rate of 3.25% plus applicable margin of 5.5%). The two tranches of the second lien indebtedness under the A&R Second Lien Credit Agreement will bear interest at 6% per annum (Tranche A) and, for the first year after closing, 22.45% per annum (Tranche B), respectively, and will be capitalized and added to the principal balance of the loans unless certain conditions are satisfied to pay such interest in cash. The new term loans under the Priority Second Lien Credit Agreement will bear interest at 12% per annum payable quarterly in arrears in cash. If the economic downturn and competitive factors mentioned herein continue to have a negative impact on our business and our operating results do not meet our projections upon which our financial covenants were set under the New Credit Facilities, our income may not be sufficient to service our outstanding indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may lead to the inability to satisfy our financial covenants under the New Credit Facilities (including the consolidated total leverage ratio, the consolidated first lien leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenants). If we were unable to meet our required financial covenant levels and/or our debt service and repayment obligations under our New Credit Facilities, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our New Credit Facilities, which if uncured or not waived, would allow our lenders to declare all outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable and would materially impair our financial condition and liquidity.We have a history of losses from continuing operations, which we believe was most recently exacerbated by the economic downturn and competitive factors, and there can be no assurance that our performance will improve. If we were to incur further operating losses, we could lack sufficient funds to continue to operate our business in the ordinary course.Our operating results have been significantly affected by the economic downturn that commenced in 2008. Since the economic downturn in 2008, advertisers and the agencies that represent them have exerted downward pressure on advertising rates and in certain instances, requested steep percentage discounts on ad buys and increased levels of inventory, re-negotiated booked orders or released advertising funds much later in the cycle. In 2012, our operating loss was $(124,253), excluding the goodwill impairment of $92,194, our operating loss was $(32,059), an increased loss of $25,509 compared to our 2011 operating loss of $(6,550), or an increased loss of $117,703, including the goodwill impairment. We believe our 2012 results were adversely impacted by late cancellations in ad buys (which we believe was a by-product of the election and renewed economic uncertainty), competitive factors, such as a greater diversity of digital ad platforms (into which ad budgets have flowed) and increased competition from our major competitors, and advertisers' response to controversial statements by a certain nationally syndicated talk radio personality in March 2012. The advertising marketplace has been difficult to predict. Advertisers' demands and advertising budgets have not improved to pre-recession levels as many businesses address their own internal challenges, and seek to maintain maximum budget flexibility, which has negatively impacted our operating performance. If, among other things, the advertising marketplace does not become more stable and predictable, we continue to face increased competition or we are unable to restore the value of our news/talk programming inventory, including by bringing back advertisers into such programming, then our financial position could worsen, including to the point where, in the absence of satisfying or obtaining waiver of the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the New Credit Facilities or obtaining further amendments to our Credit Facilities or our New Credit Facilities, to the extent effective, we could lack sufficient liquidity to continue to operate our business in the ordinary course.The obligations and cost of our indebtedness are substantial, which further affects our liquidity and could limit our ability to implement our business plan.We presently have a $155,000 First Lien Credit Agreement which currently bears interest at a variable rate currently set at 8.0% per annum; an $85,000 Second Lien Credit Agreement which currently bears interest at a variable rate, currently set at 13.0% per annum, $30,000 in aggregate principal amount of PIK Notes outstanding which bear interest at 15.0% per annum and a $25,000 revolving credit facility that currently bears interest at a variable rate, currently at 8.0% per annum. As of December 31, 2012, we had a total of $285,975 of indebtedness (net of original issue discount and not including total outstanding letters of credit of $4,976). At current interest rates, the average annual interest expense on our current debt over the next four years is approximately $35,100 per year (compared to approximately $34,900 in interest expense in 2012 for our long-term debt). Further, the interest on our debt is variable such that at December 31, 2012, if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, annualized interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $1,385, based on our exposure to interest rate changes on debt that is not covered 12by caps. As required by the terms of the First Lien Credit Agreement, we are required to pay down $3,875, $7,750, $11,625, and $15,500 of our first lien debt during 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, with the balance scheduled to be paid at maturity. As described further in Note 17 — Subsequent Event to the Consolidated Financial Statements, upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the New Credit Facilities, beginning March 31, 2013, the A&R First Lien Term Loan Facility shall have scheduled annual repayments of the original principal amount payable, with annual repayment amounts (payable in quarterly installments) of $7,750, $11,625, $15,500 and $14,531 in the aggregate for 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 (through September 30, 2016), respectively, and with the balance scheduled to be paid at maturity. The original principal amount of each of the A&R Second Lien Term Loan Facility and the Second Lien Priority Term Loan Facility shall be payable at their respective maturity dates. Interest shall be payable on loans under the A&R Revolving Credit Facility and A&R First Lien Term Loan Facility at a rate equal to Eurodollar Base Rate or the base rate, plus an applicable margin, as selected by us. Interest is payable on the A&R Second Lien Term Loan Facility and the Second Lien Priority Term Loan Facility at fixed rates as described above.Additionally, beginning in 2013 (within 5 business days of the delivery of our 2012 annual financial statements) under the A&R First Lien Credit Agreement (assuming the recapitalization closes), we will be required to pay down an amount equal to (x) 75% of the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in such agreement) for the preceding fiscal year less (y) any voluntary (optional) prepayments of term loans during such fiscal year or voluntary prepayments of revolving loans and swing loans during such fiscal year to the extent that such loans were permanently and concurrently reduced thereby. If the economy does not meaningfully improve or improve on a more consistent basis and our financial results continue to come under pressure as a result or for any other reason, or the variable interest rates on our debt increase, we may be required to delay the implementation or reduce the scope of our business plan and our ability to develop or enhance our services or programs would, in such event, likely be adversely impacted. Without additional revenue, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities or secure rights to name-brand or popular programming (or develop new services), or respond to competitive pressures. If any of the foregoing should occur, this could have a material and adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.CBS Radio provides us with a significant portion of our commercial inventory and audience that we sell to advertisers. A material reduction in the audience delivered by CBS Radio stations or a material loss of commercial inventory from CBS Radio would have an adverse effect on our advertising sales and financial results.While we provide programming to all major radio station groups, we have affiliation agreements with most of CBS Radio's owned and operated radio stations which, in the aggregate, provide us with a significant portion of the audience and commercial inventory that we sell to advertisers, much of which is in the more desirable top 10 radio markets. Although the compensation we pay to CBS Radio under our arrangement is adjustable based on the audience levels and commercial clearance it delivers (i.e., the percentage of commercial inventory broadcast by CBS Radio stations), any significant loss of audience or inventory delivered by CBS Radio stations, including, by way of example only, as a result of a decline in station audience, commercial clearance levels or station sales that resulted in lower audience levels, would have a material adverse impact on our advertising sales and revenue. There can be no assurance that CBS Radio will maintain audience and clearance levels and these higher levels mean our station compensation payable to CBS Radio has been significantly increased. As discussed in Note 17 — Subsequent Event to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into an amendment with CBS to modify certain terms of our Master Agreement and ancillary agreements thereto. While our arrangement with CBS Radio is scheduled to continue through 2017, there can be no assurance that such arrangement will not be breached by either party prior to 2017 or that CBS will not seek to amend or modify the terms of such arrangement in a way not desired by us. If our agreement with CBS Radio were terminated as a result of such breach, our results of operations could be materially impacted.We have recently enacted several executive management changes at the CEO-level and there can be no assurance such changes will be effective and help us meet our financial projections.On March 19, 2013, we announced that our Board had chosen a new CEO, Paul Caine, effective April 5, 2013 and that our then existing CEO, Spencer Brown, and President Ken Williams were resigning. This followed the resignation of David Landau, then co-CEO with Messrs. Brown and Williams, in February 2013. Each of Messrs. Brown, Williams and Landau helped found and build the Company over the course of approximately 10 years. While the Board believes a new CEO with significant sales, marketing and branding experience will help increase revenue, particularly in new planned areas such as sponsorships and digital advertising, there can be no assurance Mr. Caine will be able to help us increase revenues meaningfully, either quickly or over time.13Our business is subject to increased competition from new entrants into our business, consolidated companies and new technologies/platforms, each of which has the potential to adversely affect our business.Our business operates in a highly competitive environment. Our radio programming competes for audiences and advertising revenue directly with radio stations and other syndicated programming. We also compete for advertising dollars with other media such as television, satellite radio, Internet radio, newspapers, magazines, cable television, outdoor advertising, direct mail and, increasingly, other digital media. While the overall radio audience has remained stable, these new media platforms have gained an increased share of advertising dollars and their introduction could lead to decreasing revenue for traditional media. Additionally, new or existing competitors may have resources significantly greater than our own. In particular, the consolidation of the radio industry has created opportunities for large radio groups, such as Cumulus Media, Clear Channel Communications and CBS Radio to gather information and produce radio programming on their own. If other content companies were to merge with companies with a distribution network, the demand for our programming could decrease if those content providers elect to broadcast more of their programming on their owned and operated radio stations instead of on stations affiliated with external radio networks, such as our network, as has been the case with Cumulus Media since its merger. While we believe that the Merger provided us with a broader, more robust and more diverse range of programming and services, we do not own and operate radio stations, while each of the aforementioned competitors do, which provides them with a built-in distribution network for their programs and products. To the extent the audience for our programs declines or this trend in consolidation continues, advertisers' willingness to purchase our advertising could be reduced.Our failure to obtain or retain the rights in popular programming could adversely affect our operating results.The operating results from our radio programming business depends in part on our continued ability to secure and retain the rights to popular programming and then to sell such programming at a profit. We obtain a significant portion of our programming from third parties. For example, some of our most widely heard broadcasts, including certain NFL and NCAA games, are made available based upon programming rights of varying duration that we have negotiated with third parties. Competition for popular programming that is licensed from third parties is intense, and due to increased costs of such programming or potential capital constraints, we may be outbid by our competitors for the rights to new, popular programming or to renew popular programming currently licensed by us. Even when we are able to secure popular programming, the fee for such programming (particularly sports programs and high-profile talent) is often significantly increased as a result of the competitive bidding process, which requires that we sell the advertising in this programming at a sufficiently higher volume and rate to offset the increased fees, which in this economic environment is not always possible. In addition, if we are unable to comply with our obligations under our programming agreements, our counterparties could terminate such agreements. While the Merger diversified our business and provided us with a wider array of programming and services, our failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content including as a result of our failure to comply with our programming agreements, would materially and adversely affect our operating results. We recognized impairment charges in the third and fourth quarters of 2012 and may recognize additional such charges in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We evaluate our goodwill for impairment at least annually, and more often when changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. We recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. In assessing fair value, we rely primarily on a discounted cash flow model and other generally accepted valuation methodologies. In our assessment, we consider qualitative factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, our outlook for business activity, our recent and forecasted financial performance and the price of our common stock. These analyses necessarily rely on the judgments and estimates of management, which involve inherent uncertainties. The estimated fair value of our goodwill may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in market conditions, the effects of a general economic slowdown, operational performance, fluctuations in the price of our common stock and other unanticipated events and circumstances. In such event, the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of goodwill could be negatively affected and could result in an impairment of our goodwill. When we are required to recognize an impairment charge, it is recorded as an operating expense in the period in which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.As of September 30, 2012, we performed an evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets and recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of $67,218 as of September 30, 2012. Upon completion of the full interim review we recorded an additional goodwill impairment of $24,976 in the fourth quarter of 2012, resulting in a final goodwill impairment charge of $92,194 for the year ended December 31, 2012. We also performed the annual review for impairment of goodwill in December of 2012 and based upon such review no further impairment of goodwill was recorded. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the fair value of our goodwill, it is possible a material change could occur in the future. We will continue to conduct impairment analyses of our goodwill on a regular basis, and we would be required to take 14additional impairment charges in the future if any recoverability assessments thereof reflect estimated fair values which are less than our recorded values, and such charges could be significant. Further impairment charges with respect to our goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we are not able to integrate future merger and acquisition ("M&A") activity successfully, our operating results could be harmed.We evaluate M&A opportunities, including acquisitions and dispositions, on an ongoing basis and intend to pursue opportunities in our industry and related industries that can assist us in achieving our growth strategy. The success of our future strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate M&A opportunities and, if necessary, to obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing to fund such opportunities. M&A is inherently risky, and any M&A transactions we do complete may not be successful.Even if we are able to consummate the M&A transactions we pursue, such transactions may involve certain risks, including, but not limited to, the following: •diversion of our management's attention from normal daily operations of our business;•responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we sell, merge with and/or acquire;•insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with the M&A transactions we consummate or inability to realize the synergies we identify;•inability to maintain the key business relationships and reputations in connection with such M&A;•potential loss of key employees in connection with any M&A we undertake;•difficulty in integrating and managing the operations, technologies and products of the companies we merge with and/or acquire;•uncertainty of entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience or in which competitors have stronger market positions; and•dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and partners of the companies we merge with and/or acquire.Certain future M&A transactions would require the consent of our lenders under the Credit Facilities (and the New Credit Facilities if the recapitalization closes).Our success is dependent upon audience acceptance of our content which is difficult to predict.Revenue from our radio business is dependent on our continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behavior on a timely basis. Because consumer preferences are consistently evolving, the commercial success of a radio program is difficult to predict. It depends on the quality and acceptance of other competing programs, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. An audience's acceptance of programming is demonstrated by rating points which are a key factor in determining the advertising rates that we receive. Low ratings can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising revenue. Consequently, low public acceptance of our content could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Risks Related to Our Common StockWe presently trade on the OTC Pink Sheets and our Class A Common Stock is thinly traded. Our common stock currently trades in the Pink Sheets. There can be no assurance that it will continue to do so as we are dependent on one or more market makers making a market in our common stock, and even if they continue to do so, there can be no assurance that an active trading market will be maintained. Broker-dealers may decline to trade in the Pink Sheets because (1) the market for such securities is often limited, (2) such securities are generally more volatile, and (3) the risk to investors is generally greater. In addition, we filed a Form 15 deregistering our Class A common stock in January 2013 and after this report, we will not be filing periodic reports with the SEC. This will result in less information about us being available to stockholders and investors immediately following the effective date of the deregistration. Consequently, selling our Class A common stock could be difficult because smaller quantities of shares can be bought and sold, transactions can be delayed and securities analyst and media coverage of us may be reduced. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for shares of our Class A common stock as well as lower trading volume. We cannot provide any assurance that, even if our Class A common stock continues to be listed or quoted on the Pink Sheets or another market or system, the market for our Class A common stock will be as liquid. 15This lack of liquidity could adversely affect our stock price, and could also make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business.Sales of additional shares of common stock by Triton, Gores or our other significant equity holders could adversely affect the stock price, particularly given the thin daily trading volume in our Class A common stock. Triton and Gores own approximately 60% and 30%, respectively, of our common stock on a combined basis (i.e., Class B common stock and Class A common stock, respectively). There can be no assurance that at some future time Triton, Gores, or our other significant equity holders, will not, subject to the applicable requirements under the Securities Act, sell additional shares of our common stock, which could adversely affect our share price, particularly because so much of our Class A common stock is closely held which means we have a low public float and the daily trading volume is light. The perception that these sales might occur could also cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Such sales could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. As part of the recapitalization, we will issue additional shares of our common stock and new preferred stock with voting power and warrants for our common stock that will cause significant and meaningful dilution of our existing equity securities.As part of the recapitalization that is expected to become effective on or around April 16, 2013 upon the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions precedent, including the absence of a material adverse effect since January 15, 2013 (other than those based on facts previously disclosed to the lenders prior to February 28, 2013), (i) certain of the lenders under our existing Second Lien Credit Agreement are expected to exchange approximately $63,000 of the outstanding obligations under the Second Lien Credit Agreement for a new 15% Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, that has certain corporate governance rights (including certain voting rights, certain “negative controls” and the right to designate 3 of 7 members of our Board of Directors) and penny warrants to purchase 12% of our Common Stock, (ii) the lender under the Priority Second Lien Credit Agreement will be issued penny warrants to purchase 7.5% of our outstanding Common Stock for nominal consideration. (iii) the holders of our PIK Notes and our existing Series A Preferred Stock are expected to exchange their PIK Notes and existing Series A Preferred Stock for our Common Stock pursuant to various subscription and exchange agreements on terms to be determined, and (iv) Triton and Gores are expected to purchase, directly or indirectly, $16,500 of additional shares of our equity securities on terms to be decided. Additionally, it is currently contemplated that a management incentive plan for approximately 10-15% of the then outstanding equity will be enacted after the recapitalization closes (assuming it closes). The issuance of such shares of our Common Stock, any exercise of such warrants for our Common Stock and the enactment of such an incentive plan will significantly dilute the existing shares of our Common Stock, potentially to a small fraction of the Common Stock held by them today, which issuance of stock could adversely affect our stock price. The issuance of our new 15% Series A Preferred Stock will further dilute the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock (e.g., our common stock). Such issuances could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business.Any further issuance of shares of preferred or common stock by us could further dilute the voting power of the common stockholders and adversely affect the value of our common stock or delay or prevent a change of control of our company. Our Board of Directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 200,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. Additionally, Triton and Gores have voting control over corporate actions as described in more detail below and can collectively decide to issue and purchase additional shares of common stock, including to the extent necessary to provide additional funding to us in connection with a negotiated amendment with our lenders, which would dilute the value of existing common stock and could further dilute their voting rights as well if such contribution/investment was made in voting stock. The further issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.To the extent we choose to issue preferred stock, any such issuance may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares. In connection with the Merger, we issued 9,691.374 shares of Series A Preferred Stock leaving 190,308.626 shares of preferred stock available for future issuance.16The issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock (as was the case with the Series A Preferred Stock) could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive. For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock.Triton and Gores are able to exert, and after the recapitalization our Second Lien lenders also will be able to exert, significant influence over us and our significant corporate decisions and may act in a manner that advance their best interest and not necessarily those of other stockholders. As a result of their collective beneficial ownership of 90% of our common stock, Triton and Gores have voting control over our corporate actions. Gores currently owns 76% of the Class A common stock (which accounts for 30% of our common stock on a combined basis), which votes as a separate class on certain actions; and Triton currently owns 100% of the Class B common stock (which accounts for 60% of our common stock on a combined basis), which also votes as a separate class on certain actions. Upon the effectiveness of the recapitalization, (i) the holders of the loans under the A&R Second Lien Credit Agreement will hold new 15% Series A Preferred Stock with voting rights and certain other corporate governance rights and (ii) the holders of the loans under the A&R Second Lien Credit Agreement and Priority Second Lien Credit Agreement will hold warrants to purchase 12% and 7% of our common stock, respectively. For so long as Triton and Gores continue to beneficially own shares of common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock and our second lien lenders hold our new 15% Series A Preferred Stock, they will be able to elect the members of our Board of Directors and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on common stock (subject to the covenants and limitations set forth in our Credit Facilities and New Credit Facilities, after the recapitalization). As discussed above, in connection with the recapitalization, our Board will be reduced from nine to seven directors and may not have any independent directors after the closing of the recapitalization. Each of Triton, Gores and our second lien lenders may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders by, among other things:•delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control;•impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination;•discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control; or•causing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all of our stockholders.Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, both before and after the recapitalization, and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, both of which are being amended and restated in connection with the recapitalization, and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. This provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if any, for use as working capital and for other general corporate purposes. Any payment of future cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, our Credit Facilities and New Credit Facilities, after the recapitalization, restrict the payment of dividends.17Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.
