EXHIBITS 318 PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION Accounting Principles Under Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 19, 2002, all companies governed by the law of an EU Member State and whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market of any Member State must prepare their consolidated financial statements in conformity with the International Financial Reporting Standards previously adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS). The Bank of Spain Circular 4/2004 of December 22, 2004 on Public and Confidential Financial Reporting Rules and Formats (Circular 4/2004) requires Spanish credit institutions to adapt their accounting systems to the principles derived from the adoption by the European Union of International Financial Reporting Standards. Therefore, Grupo Santander (the Group or Santander) is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with the EU-IFRS and Bank of Spains Circular 4/2004. Differences between EU-IFRS, Bank of Spains Circular 4/2004 and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (IFRS-IASB) are not material. Therefore, we assert that the financial information contained in this annual report on Form 20-F complies with IFRS-IASB. We have formatted our financial information according to the classification format for banks used in Spain. We have not reclassified the line items to comply with Article 9 of Regulation S-X. Article 9 is a regulation of the US Securities and Exchange Commission that contains formatting requirements for bank holding company financial statements. Our auditors, Deloitte, S.L., an independent registered public accounting firm, have audited our consolidated financial statements in respect of the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 in accordance with IFRS-IASB. See page F-1 to our consolidated financial statements for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 report prepared by Deloitte, S.L. General Information Our consolidated financial statements are in Euros, which are denoted euro, euros, EUR or  throughout this annual report. Also, throughout this annual report, when we refer to:  dollars, US$ or $, we mean United States dollars;  pounds or £, we mean United Kingdom pounds; and  one billion, we mean 1,000 million. When we refer to average balances for a particular period, we mean the average of the month-end balances for that period, unless otherwise noted. We do not believe that monthly averages present trends that are materially different from trends that daily averages would show. In calculating our interest income, we include any interest payments we received on non-accruing loans if they were received in the period when due. We have not reflected consolidation adjustments in any financial information about our subsidiaries or other business units. When we refer to loans, we mean loans, leases, discounted bills and accounts receivable, unless otherwise noted. The loan to value LTV ratios disclosed in this report refer to LTV ratios upon origination unless otherwise noted. Additionally, if a debt is approaching a doubtful status, we update the appraisals which are then used to estimate allowances for loan losses. When we refer to impaired balances or non-performing balances, we mean impaired or non-performing loans and contingent liabilities (NPL), securities and other assets to collect. When we refer to allowances for credit losses, we mean the specific allowances for credit losses, and unless otherwise noted, the collectively assessed allowance for credit losses and any allowances for country-risk.
