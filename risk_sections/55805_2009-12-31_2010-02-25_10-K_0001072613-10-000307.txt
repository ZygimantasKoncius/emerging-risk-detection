ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report, North American Galvanizing cautions current and potential investors that the following risk factors, among others, sometimes have affected, and in the future could affect, the Company’s actual results and could cause such results during fiscal 2010, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of North American Galvanizing. If any of the following risks actually occurs, the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and you may lose all of your investment. Galvanizing is a business sensitive to economic downturns. The Company is principally engaged, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, in hot-dip galvanizing of metal products and components fabricated by its customers. All of the Company’s revenue is generated from the value-added galvanizing and coating of its customer’s products. The galvanizing process provides effective corrosion protection of fabricated steel, which is used in numerous markets such as petrochemical, highway and transportation, energy, utilities, communications, irrigation, pulp and paper, waste water treatment, food processing, recreation and the manufacture of original equipment. The demand for these products and, in turn, for the Company’s galvanizing, is dependent on the general economy, the industries listed and other factors affecting domestic goods activity. The current economic downturn and a continued or worsening economic downturn may negatively affect the Company’s customer base. Continued disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect the Company’s customers’ ability to access capital, which supports the continuation and expansion of the Company’s customers’ projects, and may lead to project cancellations, suspensions or delays. A number of other factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries the Company serves, could adversely affect the Company’s customers and their ability or willingness to fund 6 capital expenditures in the future and pay for past services. Disruptions in the Company’s customers’ projects or businesses generally could cause a significant reduction in demand, which could cause a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of galvanizing services provided by the Company, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition. The price volatility and availability of zinc and natural gas could reduce the Company’s profits. Zinc and natural gas, combined, represent the largest portion of the Company’s cost of goods sold. The price and availability of zinc and natural gas that is used in the hot-dip galvanizing process is highly competitive and cyclical. The following factors, most of which are beyond the Company’s control, affect the price of zinc and natural gas: · supply and demand factors; · freight costs and transportation availability; · inventory levels; · trade duties and taxes; and · labor disputes. In response to an increase in costs, the Company may seek to maintain its profit margin by attempting to increase the price of its services, but may not be successful in passing these price increases through to its customers, particularly in an economic downturn. If the prices of zinc and/or natural gas increase significantly and the Company is not successful in passing these price increases through to its customers, the Company’s results of operations and profits may be significantly reduced. Limited access to capital for internal growth and strategic acquisitions could adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition. The Company’s operating and market strategies to maintain competitive position and to develop new markets include investments in internal growth and strategic acquisitions. If the Company is unable to access capital or raise capital, on favorable terms or at all, the Company may not be able to invest in internal growth and strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition. The Company’s acquisition strategy involves a number of risks. The Company intends to grow through acquisitions of assets of, or interests in, additional geographically strategic hot-dip galvanizing plants or related businesses. The Company routinely reviews potential acquisition opportunities, however it may not be able to implement its growth strategy if it is unable to identify strategic acquisition targets or make acquisitions on acceptable terms. In addition, the Company may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing in order to make future acquisitions, which financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Any such equity financing may have a dilutive effect on current stockholders of the Company. If the Company is able to make acquisitions, the Company may not be able to effectively integrate an acquired business or acquired assets. The process of integrating acquired businesses and/or assets involves certain risks, including: · assimilating operations and products may be unexpectedly difficult; · management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns; · the Company may enter markets in which it has limited or no direct experience; · additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management and financial reporting; · failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits that the Company anticipated 7 in connection with the acquisition; · risks and liabilities from the acquisition targets, some of which may not be discovered during due diligence; and · the Company may lose key employees and/or key customers of an acquired business. Risks involved in the Company’s acquisition strategy could adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition. The departure of key personnel, including senior management and executive officers, could disrupt the Company’s business. The Company’s ability to provide a competitive service that is both acceptable in quality and price requires a strong team of executive officers and senior management that are technically skilled in providing galvanizing services. In past years, the Company has downsized administrative and management positions as a result of cost-cutting initiatives. The Company cannot be certain that any executive officer or member of senior management will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. If there is turnover in such key personnel, the Company may not be able to hire and retain qualified replacements. A lack of effective executive officers and senior management could impact the Company’s ability to operate and compete in the galvanizing industry, which could disrupt the Company’s business and adversely affect its results of operations. Galvanizing is a highly competitive business, and if the Company is unable to compete effectively, the Company may experience a reduction in demand for galvanizing services, which in turn could adversely affect the Company’s revenues. Galvanizing is a highly competitive business with relatively low barriers to entry. The Company competes with other galvanizing companies, captive galvanizing facilities operated by manufacturers and alternate forms of corrosion protection such as paint. Certain of the Company’s competitors are larger than the Company and have more resources than the Company does. Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Excessive capacity in hot-dip galvanizing could have a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of galvanized services provided by the Company. In addition, certain of the Company’s competitors may have lower cost structures and may be able to provide services at a lower price than the Company is able to provide. The Company cannot be certain that its competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in price and quality. In addition, the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to maintain or enhance its competitive position within the industries it serves or maintain or increase its customer base. If the Company is unable to compete effectively, the Company may experience a reduction in demand, which in turn could adversely affect the Company’s revenues. The Company’s operating and financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The Company’s quarterly operating and financial results are difficult to predict and could fluctuate significantly from period to period. The level of the Company’s revenues, gross margins and results of operations at any given time will be based primarily on the following factors, many of which the Company has no control over: · the timing and volume of work from the Company’s customers; · general economic conditions; · escalating raw material and/or energy costs; · interruptions to raw material and/or energy supplies; · the budgetary spending patterns of the Company’s customers; 8 · variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter; · losses experienced in the Company’s operations; · a change in the demand or production of the Company’s services caused by severe weather conditions or otherwise; · a chance in the mix of the Company’s customers, contracts and business; · a change in the Company’s customer delivery schedule; and · increases in the Company’s cost of goods sold. If realized, any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results. The Company may not be able to generate or manage internal growth. Part of the Company’s strategy is to grow its business internally to increase its competitiveness in the market. As a result, the Company is subject to certain growth-related risks, including the risk that the Company will be unable to retain personnel or secure additional qualified employees, attract new customers or increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers or acquire other resources necessary to service such growth adequately. The Company cannot be certain that it will be able to generate sufficient revenues to fund expenses related to enhanced operations and support internal growth. As such, any efforts to generate internal growth may have a negative impact on operating results. Even if the Company is able to generate internal growth, if the Company fails to effectively manage such growth in a manner that minimizes strains on its resources, the Company could experience disruptions in operations and ultimately be unable to generate revenues or profits. The Company’s Board of Directors may have a significant influence on the outcome of stockholder votes. As of December 31, 2009, the Company’s board of directors collectively owned approximately 24.9.% of the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, the directors, as a group, may be able to significantly influence the outcome of the Company’s stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. The existence of a relatively high level of ownership concentrated in a few persons makes it less likely that any other holder of the Company’s common stock will be able to affect the Company’s management or direction. These factors may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in management or voting control or the Company’s participation in a merger or other significant corporate transaction. Various governmental regulations and environmental risks applicable to the galvanizing business may require the Company to take actions which will adversely affect its results of operations. The Company’s business is subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations with respect to air emissions, storm water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. Legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and the presently unpredictable ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements could affect operations. The Company may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition. In regards to concerns about global warming, global warming could have an adverse impact on the Company, particularly in hurricane prone or low lying areas near the ocean. At this time, the Company is not able to 9 speculate as to the potential timing or impact from potential global warming, however the Company believes that it currently has adequate insurance coverage related to natural disasters at the NAGC sites. There are several initiatives in the United States and other countries to regulate certain industries and actions to reduce the impact of global warming. Some of these initiatives, if made effective, could have a direct adverse impact on the Company’s operations or an indirect adverse impact by affecting suppliers or customers. In September 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) promulgated a new regulation regarding the registry of greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. Currently the Company does not have any sites that are required to report such emissions under the new EPA climate registry rule. The Company does not expect the regulation to have a significant impact from a cost or operations perspective, but will continue to monitor proposed legislation and regulation and its impact. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS No unresolved staff comments were open as of the date of this report, February 24, 2010. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES NAGC operates eleven hot dip galvanizing plants located in Ohio, Oklahoma, Missouri, Texas, Colorado, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. The West Virginia plant was completed and became operational in the second quarter of 2009 and is leased under terms which give NAGC the option to extend the lease until September 2023. The Company’s plant, located in Kansas City, Missouri is leased under terms which give NAGC the option to extend the lease until September 2015. NAGC’s galvanizing plants average 20,000 square feet in size, with the largest approximately 55,000 square feet, and it operates zinc kettles ranging in length from 16 to 62 feet. The Company owns all of its galvanizing plants, except for the Kansas City plant noted above. All of the Company’s owned galvanizing plants are pledged as collateral to a bank pursuant to a credit agreement scheduled to expire July 17, 2012, under which the Company is provided a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $25 million with future increases of up to an aggregate principal amount of $15 million. The Company experienced a fire November 20, 2009 at its St. Louis facility. There were no injuries, and there was no environmental contamination outside the plant. The plant is currently idle, and the fire affected the Company’s 2009 earnings due to loss of business. The Company is transporting product to be galvanized from the St. Louis market to other North American Galvanizing Company plants in its eleven plant network. The plant property is insured at a value that approximates replacement cost, and the insurance coverage also includes coverage for business interruption loss and reimbursement for extra expense. At December 31, 2009, the net book value of building and equipment and inventory that was destroyed was removed from property, plant and equipment and inventory and a receivable from insurance of $1.6 million was recorded which is equivalent to the net book value of destroyed assets plus related expenses incurred through year-end. The Company is continuing to compile its claim, and received initial cash proceeds from insurance in February, 2010 (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company expects to receive additional cash proceeds from insurance during 2010. The Company’s headquarters office is located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in approximately 4,600 square feet of office space leased through February 2012. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS NAGC was notified in 1997 by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (“IEPA”) that it was one of approximately 60 potentially responsible parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System (“CERCLIS”) in connection with cleanup of an abandoned site formerly owned by Sandoval Zinc Co., an entity unrelated to NAGC. The IEPA notice includes NACG as one of the organizations which arranged for the treatment and disposal of hazardous substances at Sandoval. The estimated timeframe for resolution of the IEPA contingency is unknown. The IEPA has yet to respond to a proposed work plan submitted in August 2000 by a group of the potentially responsible parties or 10 suggest any other course of action, and there has been no activity in regards to this issue since 2001. Until the work plan is approved and completed, the range of potential loss or remediation, if any, is unknown, and in addition, the allocation of potential loss between the 60 potentially responsible parties is unknown and not reasonably estimable. Therefore, the Company has no basis for determining potential exposure and estimated remediation costs at this time and no liability has been accrued. In September 2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified the Company of a claim against the Company as a potentially responsible party related to a Superfund site in Texas City, Texas. This matter pertains to galvanizing facilities of a Company subsidiary and its disposal of waste, which was handled by their supplier in the early 1980’s. The EPA offered the Company a special de minimis party settlement to resolve potential liability that the Company and its subsidiaries may have under CERCLA at this Site. The Company accrued the $112,145 de minimis settlement amount during the third quarter of 2008 and accepted the EPA’s offer before the deadline of December 30, 2008. North American Galvanizing & Coatings, Inc. and its subsidiary are parties to a number of other lawsuits, which are not discussed herein. Management of the Company, based upon their analysis of known facts and circumstances and reports from legal counsel, does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the Company. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS No matters were submitted to a vote of stockholders during the fourth quarter of 2009. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Stock Information The Company’s common stock traded under the symbol “NGA” on the American Stock Exchange through August 1, 2007 and began trading under the same three-digit symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market on August 2, 2007. The Company does not expect to pay a dividend on its common stock and has not done so in the past. The Company expects to continue that policy in order to reinvest earnings to support and expand its business operations. The Company’s board of directors may review the dividend policy in the future, recognizing that dividends may be a desirable form of return on the investment made by many of its stockholders. Stockholders of record at December 31, 2009 numbered approximately 1,126.

Hot dip galvanizing is the process of applying a zinc coating to fabricated iron or steel material by immersing the material in a bath consisting primarily of molten zinc. Overview The Company’s galvanizing plants offer a broad line of services, including centrifuge galvanizing for small threaded products, sandblasting, chromate quenching, polymeric coatings, and its proprietary INFRASHIELDsm Coating Application Systems, which provides polyurethane protective linings and coatings over galvanized surfaces. The Company’s structural and chemical engineers provide customized assistance with initial fabrication design, project estimates and steel chemistry selection. The Company’s galvanizing and coating operations are composed of eleven facilities located in Colorado, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. The company completed construction of the Benwood, West Virginia plant in the second quarter 2009. These facilities operate galvanizing kettles ranging in length from 16 feet to 62 feet, and have lifting capacities ranging from 12,000 pounds to 40,000 pounds. The Company maintains a sales and service network coupled with its galvanizing plants, supplemented by national account business development at the corporate level. In 2009, the Company galvanized steel products for approximately 1,700 customers nationwide. All of the Company’s sales are generated from customers whose end markets are principally in the United States. The Company markets its galvanizing and coating services directly to its customers and does not utilize agents or distributors. Although hot dip galvanizing is considered a mature service industry, the Company is actively engaged in developing new markets through participation in industry trade shows, metals trade associations and presentation of technical seminars by its national marketing service team. Hot dip galvanizing provides metals corrosion protection for many product applications used in commercial, construction and industrial markets. The Company’s galvanizing can be found in almost every major application and industry that requires corrosion protection where iron or steel is used, including the following end user markets: · highway and transportation; · power transmission and distribution; · wireless and telecommunications; · utilities; · petrochemical processing; · industrial grating; · infrastructure, including buildings, airports, bridges and power generation; · wastewater treatment; · fresh water storage and transportation; FS - 1 · pulp and paper; · pipe and tube; · food processing; · agricultural, including irrigation systems; · recreation, including boat trailers, marine docks, stadium scaffolds; · bridge and pedestrian handrail; and · original equipment manufactured products, including general fabrication. As a value-added service provider, the Company’s revenues are directly influenced by the level of economic activity in the various end markets that it serves. Economic activity in those markets that results in the expansion and/or upgrading of physical facilities (i.e., construction) may involve a time-lag factor of several months before translating into a demand for galvanizing fabricated components. Despite the inherent seasonality associated with large project construction work, the Company maintains a relatively stable revenue stream throughout the year by offering large and small fabricators reliable and rapid turn-around service. The Company records revenues when the galvanizing processes and inspection utilizing industry-specified standards are completed. The Company generates all of its operating cash from such revenues and has a line of credit available, which is secured by its underlying accounts receivable and zinc inventory, to facilitate working capital and other capital needs. Each of the Company’s galvanizing plants operates in a highly competitive environment underscored by pricing pressures, primarily from other public and privately-owned galvanizers and alternative forms of corrosion protection, such as paint. The Company’s long-term response to these challenges has been a sustained strategy focusing on providing a reliable quality of galvanizing to standard industry technical specifications and rapid turn-around time on every project, large and small. Key to the success of this strategy is the Company’s continuing commitment and long-term record of reinvesting earnings to upgrade its galvanizing facilities, implement technical innovations to improve production efficiencies and construct new facilities when market conditions present opportunities for growth. The Company is addressing long-term opportunities to expand its galvanizing and coatings business through programs designed to increase industry awareness of the proven and unique benefits of galvanizing for metals corrosion protection. Each of the Company’s independently operated galvanizing plants is linked to a centralized system involving sales order entry, facility maintenance and operating procedures, quality assurance, purchasing and credit and accounting that enable each plant to focus on providing galvanizing and coating services in the most cost-effective manner. The principal raw materials essential to the Company’s galvanizing and coating operations are zinc and various chemicals which are normally available for purchase in the open market. The Company experienced a fire November 20, 2009 at its St. Louis facility. There were no injuries, and there was no environmental contamination outside the plant. The plant is currently idle, and the fire affected the Company’s 2009 earnings due to loss of business. The Company is transporting product to be galvanized from the St. Louis market to other North American Galvanizing Company plants in its eleven plant network. The plant property is insured at a value that approximates replacement cost, and the insurance coverage also includes coverage for business interruption loss and reimbursement for extra expense. At December 31, 2009, the net book value of building and equipment and inventory that was destroyed was removed from property, plant and equipment and inventory and a receivable from insurance of $1.6 million was recorded which is equivalent to the net book value of destroyed assets plus related expenses incurred through year-end. The Company is continuing to compile its claim, and received initial cash proceeds from insurance in February, 2010 (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company expects to receive additional cash proceeds from insurance during 2010. FS - 2 Key Indicators Key industries which historically have provided the Company some indication of the potential demand for galvanizing in the near-term, (i.e., primarily within a year) include highway and transportation, power transmission and distribution, telecommunications and the level of quoting activity for regional metal fabricators. In general, growth in the commercial and industrial sectors of the economy generates new construction and capital spending, which ultimately impacts the demand for galvanizing. Key operating measures utilized by the Company include new orders, zinc inventory, tons of steel galvanized, revenue, pounds and labor costs per hour, zinc usage related to tonnage galvanized and lost-time safety performance. These measures are reported and analyzed on various cycles, including daily, weekly and monthly. The Company utilizes a number of key financial measures to evaluate the operations at each of its galvanizing plants and to identify trends and variables impacting operating productivity and current and future business results, which include return on capital employed, sales, gross profit, fixed and variable costs, selling and general administrative expenses, operating cash flows, capital expenditures, interest expense and a number of ratios such as profit from operations and accounts receivable turnover. These measures are reviewed by the Company’s operating and executive management each month, or more frequently, and compared to prior periods, the current business plan and to standard performance criteria, as applicable. Key Developments The Company has reported a number of developments supporting its strategic program to reposition its galvanizing business in the national market. NAGC completed constructing a new hot dip galvanizing plant in Benwood, West Virginia in the second quarter of 2009. The new operation utilizes a 30 foot kettle and becomes the Company’s eleventh hot dip galvanizing plant. NAGC completed an extensive upgrading of facilities at the Hurst plant in 2009. A new building housing the pretreatment process was constructed which will create operational efficiencies. NAGC finished a complete replacement of the furnace and kettle at the Denver plant in 2009. This new equipment provides for improved production performance and optimized energy utilization. On July 17, 2009, the Company entered into a new credit agreement between the Company and its subsidiary North American Galvanizing Company as borrowers and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer. The existing credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. was canceled. The new credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $25 million with future increases of up to an aggregate principal amount of $15 million. The purpose of the new facility is to refinance a former credit agreement, provide for issuance of standby letters of credit, provide funding for acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has not borrowed under the new credit agreement, which has a maturity date of July 17, 2012. On August 18, 2009, the Company accepted subscription agreements for $7.3 million in subordinated debt with stock warrants to purchase 1,095,000 shares of common stock of the Company. The private placement FS - 3 transaction was completed August 21, 2009. $3.1 million of the proceeds has been allocated to the stock warrants and the resulting discount on subordinated debt is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. The purpose of this additional financing is to facilitate the Company's growth strategy. The private placement was offered to a group of current large shareholders and a limited number of other accredited investors who had expressed an interest in investing in the Company. The 10% subordinated notes have a five year maturity and the warrants are immediately exercisable, for a period of up to seven years. Terms of the warrants permit the holder to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at any time prior to the expiration date, for cash at an Exercise Price of $5.20 per share (market value of common stock at date subscription was accepted). As of December 31, 2009 no warrants had been exercised. In January 2008, NAGC opened the Technical Center located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Technical Center houses the Company's engineering department and offers customers expanded technical service and guidance on their product design and performance criteria as they pertain to hot dip galvanizing. In addition, the Technical Center is focused on internal Company support activities and projects to enhance plant operating efficiencies, reduce energy usage and improve product quality. On February 28, 2005, NAGalv-Ohio, Inc., a subsidiary of North American Galvanizing Company, purchased the hot dip galvanizing assets of a galvanizing facility located in Canton, Ohio. The transaction was structured as an asset purchase, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 28, 2005 by and between NAGalv-Ohio, Inc. and the privately owned Gregory Industries, Inc. for all of the plant, property, and equipment of Gregory Industries’ after-fabrication hot dip galvanizing operation. This strategic expansion provided NAGC with an important and established customer base of major fabricators serving industrial, original equipment manufacturer and highway markets as well as residential and commercial markets for lighting poles. In July 2007, the Company replaced the existing kettle in Canton with a new 51 foot kettle, which is designed to handle large steel structures, such as bridge beams, utility poles and other steel structural components that require galvanizing for extended-life corrosion protection. FS - 4 Results of Operations The following table shows the Company’s results of operations: (Dollars in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 % of % of % of Amount Sales Amount Sales Amount Sales Sales $ 77,083 100.0 % $ 86,134 100.0 % $ 88,396 100.0 % Cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization 49,092 63.7 % 53,219 61.8 % 60,329 68.3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 9,336 12.1 % 10,039 11.6 % 9,143 10.4 % Depreciation and amortization 3,713 4.8 % 3,529 4.1 % 3,519 4.0 % Operating income 14,942 19.4 % 19,347 22.5 % 15,405 17.3 % Interest expense (425 ) (0.6 )% — — (553 ) (0.6 )% Interest income and other 27 0.0 % 247 0.3 % 81 0.1 % Income from operations before income taxes 14,544 18.8 % 19,594 22.8 % 14,933 16.8 % Income tax expense 4,887 6.3 % 7,062 8.2 % 5,701 6.4 % Income from operations 9,657 12.5 % 12,532 14.6 % 9,232 10.4 % Loss from discontinued operations (net of tax) — — (662 ) (0.8 )% — — Net Income $ 9,657 12.5 % $ 11,870 13.8 % $ 9,232 10.4 % 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 Sales. 2009 volume was approximately the same as in 2008. Although volume was the same year-over-year, there were several offsetting factors that affected 2009. In April 2009, the Company brought online a new galvanizing plant, located in Benwood, West Virginia. In late November 2009, the St. Louis plant ceased operations temporarily due to damage caused by a fire. As of February 22, 2010, the plant had not resumed operations. Fourth quarter 2009 volume was down versus prior quarters during the year, representing 22.7% of the total year volume. The fourth quarter 2009 slowdown in hot dip galvanizing demand is related to the overall slowdown in general economic activity and cannot be attributed to any one geographic area or principal market. Sales for year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 10.5% over the prior year, due to a 10.5% decline in average selling prices. Prices were affected by the economic downturn and the anticipated drop in overall demand for hot dip galvanizing along with the Company’s focus on gaining larger volume work which resulted in lower priced project work during the last half of 2009. This reduction in average prices was the primary cause of the decline in earnings. Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $4.1 million over 2008 due to a decrease in zinc and utility costs. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses. SG&A decreased $0.7 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a $0.4 million decrease in legal fees and a $0.3 million decrease in personnel costs. FS - 5 Depreciation Expense. Depreciation expense increased $.2 million from 2008 to 2009 related to an increase in machinery and equipment at the new location in West Virginia, opened in April, 2009. Interest Expense. Interest expense of $0.4 million was recorded in 2009 due to the issuance of $7.3 million in subordinated notes in August, 2009. Operating Income. For the year ended December 31, 2009, operating income was $14.9 million compared to $19.3 million for 2008. The decrease in operating income is primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices. Income Taxes. The Company’s effective income tax rates for 2009 and 2008 were 33.6% and 36.0%, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and minor adjustments to previous tax estimates. Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the loss from discontinued operations of $0.7 million is due to the final settlement with Metropolitan Water District of Greater Chicago, related to the Company’s former subsidiary, Lake River Corporation. Net Income. For 2009, the Company reported net income of $9.7 million compared to net income of $11.9 million for 2008. The decrease in net income is primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 Sales-- Sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 7% over the prior year due to an overall increase in demand from existing customers and incremental project work. The average selling price for 2008 was 9% lower than the average selling price for 2007, as a result of decreased zinc costs. The decrease in 2008 revenues of 2.6% was due to a combination of an increase in volume and a lower average sales price compared to 2007. Sales prices have decreased related to decreases in zinc costs. Cost of Sales-- The $7.1 million decrease in cost of goods sold from 2007 to 2008 was mainly to due to a decrease in zinc costs of 39.3%. Excluding the effect of increased volumes, other plant overhead costs increased $1.3 million, or 17% from 2007 to 2008, due in part to increases in repairs and maintenance spending and supplies. Excluding the effect of increased volumes, the Company’s labor costs increased $0.6 million, or 3%, from 2007 to 2008 mainly due to higher wages. Excluding the effect of increased volume, utilities costs increased $0.4 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the prior year due in large part to higher gas prices. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses-- SG&A increased $0.9 million, or 9.8%, in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was due to increases in personnel costs, primarily in the form of non-cash share-based compensation. Operating Income-- For the year ended December 31, 2008, operating income was $19.3 million, compared to $15.4 million for 2007. The increase in operating income is due to the factors described above. Income Taxes-- The Company’s effective income tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were 36.0% and 38.2%, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and adjustments to previous tax estimates based on actual tax returns filed. FS - 6 Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of income taxes-- For the year ended December 31, 2008, the loss from discontinued operations of $0.7 million is due to the final settlement with Metropolitan Water District of Greater Chicago, related to the Company’s former subsidiary, Lake River Corporation. Net Income-- For 2008, the Company reported net income of $11.9 million compared to net income of $9.2 million for 2007. The increase in net income is due to the factors described above. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company’s cash flow from operations and borrowings under credit facilities have consistently been adequate to fund its current facilities working capital and capital spending requirements. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, operating cash flow and borrowings under credit facilities have been the primary sources of liquidity. The Company monitors working capital and planned capital spending to assess liquidity and minimize cyclical cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities was $14.9 million in 2009, $14.2 million in 2008 and $14.5 million in 2007. Cash flow from operations is primarily derived from net income plus depreciation and amortization plus other non-cash items. In 2009 cash flow was negatively affected by increases in income tax receivable and decreases in current liabilities. These decreases to cash flow were more than offset by a reduction in accounts receivable and other assets and a net increase in the deferred tax accounts. Cash flow was also positively affected by non-cash share based compensation and other non-cash items. In 2008, cash flow from operating activities reflected higher net income and a $1.9 million cash outflow from changes in other operating assets and liabilities. In 2007, cash flow from operating activities reflected a net cash inflow of $0.8 million from changes in other operating assets and liabilities. Capital expenditures for equipment and upgrade of existing galvanizing facilities totaled $8.1 million in 2009, $3.2 million in 2008 and $4.4 million in 2007. Expenditures in 2009 include construction of the new facility in Benwood, West Virginia ($3.6 million), upgrading facilities at the Hurst, Texas plant ($2.0 million), and a new furnace and kettle in Denver, Colorado ($0.4 million). The Company continues to have a commitment to invest cash flow in improving plant operations. The Company expects base capital expenditures for 2010 to be between $3.0 million and $4.0 million. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $6.8 million primarily due to the issuance of subordinated debt and stock warrants totaling $6.6 million. In 2008, cash used in financing activities totaled $4.6 million, including purchase of common stock for the treasury of $5.1 million, which was offset by proceeds from exercise of stock options and tax benefits from stock option exercises and Director Stock Units distributed of $0.5 million. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $9.1, including net payments on long-term obligations and bonds of $9.3 million and purchase of common stock for the treasury of $0.2 million, which was offset by proceeds from stock options exercised and tax benefits from stock options exercises of $0.4 million. The Company does not expect an adverse effect on liquidity due to the fire at the St. Louis facility (See details in
