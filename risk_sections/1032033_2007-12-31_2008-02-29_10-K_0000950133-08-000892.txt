Item 1A. Risk Factors LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT  FFELP STUDENT LOANS Because of the new FFELP economics resulting from the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 and the increased funding spreads in the current capital markets, we have made significant changes to our business strategy, but there can be no assurance that such changes will be effective in meeting these challenges. On September 27, 2007, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 (CCRAA) was signed into law by the President. The CCRAA substantially reduced the profitability of our FFELP business, including a reduction in Special Allowance Payments, the elimination of the Exceptional Performer designation and the corresponding reduction in default payments to 97 percent through 2012 and 95 percent thereafter, an increase in the lender paid origination fees for certain loan types, and reduction in default collections retention fees and account maintenance fees related to guaranty agency activities. As a result, assuming no reductions to borrower benefits or to our operating and servicing costs, we expect that the CCRAA will reduce substantially our pre-tax yield on FFELP loans. This reduction combined with higher financing costs resulting from the severe dislocations in the global capital markets, could possibly eliminate the profitability of new FFELP loan originations, while increasing our Risk Sharing in connection with our FFELP loan portfolio. We also expect that low-balance FFELP Consolidation Loans will no longer be profitable. As a result of these developments, management has revised its business strategy to:  Focus on origination and acquisition activities for both FFELP loans and Private Education Loans that generate acceptable returns under the new FFELP economics;  Curtail unprofitable originations that have less strategic value, including:  Education loans made to certain borrowers that have or are expected to have a high default rate (see GLOSSARY  Private Education Loans); and  Wholesale Consolidation Loan acquisitions and low-balance FFELP Consolidation Loan originations.  Adjust the pricing of Private Education Loan products to reflect market conditions; and  Reduce or, over time, eliminate borrower benefits on FFELP loans. In addition, we have reduced the premium that we pay for FFELP loan volume at certain school-as-lender clients. We also anticipate reducing the premium that we pay for FFELP loan volume with certain of our lender partners. These actions are likely to effectively end our school-as-lender relationships and to result in certain of our lender partners either exiting the FFELP business or seeking others with whom to partner. These actions could also adversely affect the growth in our guarantee and APG collection businesses. We also will undertake a comprehensive review of all of our business units with a goal of achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns across all of our business segments and providing cost-effective services. In addition, we aim to reduce our operating expenses by up to 20 percent as compared to 2007 operating expenses by year-end 2009, before adjusting for growth and other investments. Since year-end 2007, as part of this expense reduction effort, we have reduced our work force by approximately three percent. Accordingly, we could lose management that are key to managing operational risk. There can be no assurance that changes we are making or may make in the future to address these developments will be successful in meeting the significant challenges of the new FFELP economics and the increased funding spreads in the current capital markets. A larger than expected increase in third-party consolidation activity may reduce our loan spreads, materially impair our Retained Interest, reduce our interest earning assets and otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations. If third-party consolidation activity increases beyond managements expectations, our student loan spread may be adversely affected; our Retained Interest may be materially impaired; our future earnings may be reduced from the loss of interest earning assets; and our results of operations may be adversely affected. Our student loan spread may be adversely affected because third-party consolidators generally target our highest yielding FFELP Loans and an increased run-off of Private Education Loans, which generally have higher 22 yields than our FFELP loans, would change the overall mix within our portfolio resulting in a reduction to our weighted-average loan spread. Our Retained Interest may be materially impaired if consolidation activity reaches levels not anticipated by management. We may also incur impairment charges if we increase our expected future Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR) assumptions used to value the Residual Interest as a result of such unanticipated levels of consolidation. The potentially material adverse affect on our operating results related to FFELP loans also relates to our hedging activities in connection with Floor Income. We enter into certain Floor Income Contracts under which we receive an upfront fee in exchange for our payment of the Floor Income earned on a notional amount of underlying FFELP Loans over the life of the Floor Income Contract. If third-party consolidation activity that involves refinancing a Sallie Mae managed existing FFELP Loan with a new third-party owned FFELP Loan increases substantially, then the Floor Income that we are obligated to pay under such Floor Income Contracts may exceed the Floor Income actually generated from the underlying FFELP loans, possibly to a material extent. In such a scenario, we would either close out the related Floor Income Contracts or purchase an offsetting hedge. In either case, the adverse impact on both our GAAP and Core Earnings could be material. (See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT  Floor Income  Managed Basis.) Incorrect estimates and assumptions by management in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. (See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.) For example, for both our federally insured and Private Education Loans, the unamortized portion of premiums and discounts is included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of student loan income discounts, as well as the impact of Repayment Borrower Benefits. In arriving at the expected yield, we make a number of estimates that when changed are reflected as a cumulative catch-up from the inception of the student loan. The most sensitive estimate for premium and discount amortization is the estimate of the CPR, which measures the rate at which loans in the portfolio pay before their stated maturity. The CPR is used in calculating the average life of the portfolio. A number of factors can affect the CPR estimate such as the rate of consolidation activity and default rates. If we make an incorrect CPR estimate, the previously recognized income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan will need to be adjusted in the current period. The amount of loan loss reserves also depends on estimates. We maintain an allowance for loan losses at an amount believed to be sufficient to absorb losses incurred in our FFELP loan and Private Education Loan portfolios based on estimated probable net credit losses as of the reporting date. We analyze those portfolios to determine the effects that the various stages of delinquency have on borrower default behavior and ultimate charge-off. When calculating the allowance for loan losses on Private Education Loans, we divide the portfolio into categories of similar risk characteristics based on loan program type, loan status (in-school, grace, repayment, forbearance, delinquency), underwriting criteria, existence or absence of a cosigner, and aging. We use historical experience coupled with qualitative factors regarding changes in portfolio mix, macroeconomic indicators, policies, procedures, laws, regulations, underwriting, and other factors to estimate default and collection rate projections. We then apply these default and collection rate projections to each category of loan to estimate the necessary allowance balance. Because the process relies on historical experience, if current or future loan loss experience varies significantly from the past, our allowance could be deemed inadequate to cover incurred losses in the portfolio. Additionally, since the allowance estimate is also reliant on other qualitative factors, managements ability to determine which qualitative factors are relevant to the allowance and our ability to accurately incorporate these factors into our estimates can have a material impact on the allowance. 23 In addition, the impact of our Repayment Borrower Benefits programs, which provide incentives to borrowers to make timely payments on their loans by allowing for reductions in future interest rates as well as rebates on outstanding balances, is dependent on the number of borrowers who will eventually qualify for these benefits. For example, we offer borrowers an incentive program that reduces their interest rate by a specified percentage per year or reduces their loan balance after they have made a specified initial number of scheduled payments on time and for so long as they continue to make subsequent scheduled payments on time. We regularly estimate the qualification rates for Repayment Borrower Benefits programs and book a level yield adjustment based upon that estimate. If our estimate of the qualification rates is lower than the actual rates, both the yield on our student loan portfolio and our net interest income will be lower than estimated and a cumulative adjustment will be made to reduce income, possibly to a material extent. Such an underestimation may also adversely affect the value of our Retained Interest because one of the assumptions made in assessing its value is the amount of Repayment Borrower Benefits expected to be earned by borrowers. Finally, we continue to look at new ways to improve borrower payment behavior. These efforts as well as the actions of competing lenders may lead to the addition or modification of Repayment Borrower Benefits programs. LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT  PRIVATE EDUCATION LOANS Changes in the composition of our Managed student loan portfolio will increase the risk profile of our asset base and our capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007, 17 percent of our Managed student loans were Private Education Loans. Private Education Loans are unsecured and are not guaranteed or reinsured under the FFELP or any other federal student loan program and are not insured by any private insurance program. Accordingly, we bear the full risk of loss on these loans if the borrower and cosigner, if applicable, default. Events beyond our control such as a prolonged economic downturn could make it difficult for Private Education Loan borrowers to meet their payment obligations for a variety of reasons, including job loss and unemployment, which could lead to higher levels of delinquencies and defaults. Private Education Loans now account for 36 percent of our Core Earnings net interest income before provisions for loan losses plus other income. We expect that Private Education Loans will become an increasingly higher percentage of both our margin and our Managed student loan portfolio, which will increase the risk profile of our asset base and raise our capital requirements because Private Education Loans have significantly higher capital requirements than FFELP loans. This may adversely affect the availability of capital for other purposes. In addition, the comparatively larger spreads on Private Education Loans, which historically have compensated for the narrowing FFELP spreads, may narrow as competition increases. As a component of our Private Education Loan program, we made available to numerous schools various tailored loan programs that were designed to help finance the education of students who were academically qualified but did not meet our standard credit criteria. Management has recently taken specific steps to terminate these lending programs because the performance of these loans is materially different from originally expected, and from the rest of the Companys Private Education Loan programs. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded provision expense of $667 million related to its Managed Private Education Loan portfolio. This significant increase in provision primarily related to the non-traditional lending programs described above which are particularly impacted by the weakening U.S. economy. However, there can be no assurance that the Companys non-traditional loans outstanding will not require additional significant loan provisions or have any further adverse effect on the overall credit quality of the Companys Managed Private Education Loan portfolio. Past charge-off rates on our Private Education Loans may not be indicative of future charge-off rates because, among other things, we use forbearance policies and our failure to adequately predict and reserve for charge-offs may adversely impact our results of operations. We have established forbearance policies for our Private Education Loans under which we provide to the borrower temporary relief from payment of principal and/or interest in exchange for a processing fee paid by the borrower, which is waived under certain circumstances. At the end of each forbearance period, generally 24 granted in six-month increments, interest that the borrower otherwise would have paid is typically capitalized. At December 31, 2007, approximately 14 percent of our Managed Private Education Loans in repayment and forbearance were in forbearance. Forbearance is used most heavily when the borrowers loan enters repayment; however, borrowers may apply for forbearance multiple times and a significant number of Private Education Loan borrowers have taken advantage of this option. When a borrower ends forbearance and enters repayment, the account is considered current. Accordingly, a borrower who may have been delinquent in his payments or may not have made any recent payments on his account will be accounted for as a borrower in a current repayment status when the borrower exits the forbearance period. In addition, past charge-off rates on our Private Education Loans may not be indicative of future charge-off rates because of, among other things, the use of forbearance and the effect of future changes to the forbearance policies. If our forbearance policies prove over time to be less effective on cash collections than we expect or if we limit the circumstances under which forbearance may be granted under our forbearance policies, the amount of future charge-offs could be materially adversely affected which could materially impact the ultimate default rate used to calculate loan loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. (See MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT  Total Loan Net Charge-offs.) In addition, our loss estimates include losses to be incurred generally over a two-year loss emergence period. The two-year estimate of the allowance for loan losses is subject to a number of assumptions about future borrower behavior that may prove incorrect. For example, we use a migration analysis of historical charge-off experience and combine that with qualitative measures to project future trends. However, future charge-off rates can be higher than anticipated due to a variety of factors such as downturns in the economy, regulatory or operational changes in asset performance management effectiveness, and other unforeseeable future trends. If actual future performance in charge-offs and delinquency is worse than estimated, this could materially affect our estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses on our income statement. If a school with which we have a business arrangement with respect to student loans closes or otherwise does not provide the borrower the promised education, the borrower could raise the same claims and defenses against us as the lender as it could against the school. As a result, our ability to collect loan amounts could be materially impaired. The FTC Holder Rule provides that borrowers, under certain circumstances, may assert the same claims and defenses against repayment of a student loan used to finance an education at a school as that borrower may have against the school itself. Specifically, if a school with whom we have a business arrangement with respect to student loans closes or otherwise does not provide the borrower the promised education, the borrower could raise the same claims and defenses that the borrower has against the school against repayment of a student loan used to finance an education at that school. With the current dislocations in the capital markets, certain for-profit schools may be unable to secure lending for its students, which could lead to serious financial difficulties and, possibly, to the school closing before its students complete their education. In such cases, borrowers could assert claims and defenses against repayment of their loans from us up to the total amount of the loan depending upon how far along they were in their program of study. In addition, school closings result in an increase in defaults for the borrowers still in attendance at those schools at the time they closed and a significant increase in school closings could materially increase our allowance for loan losses. 25 ASSET PERFORMANCE GROUP BUSINESS SEGMENT Our APG business segment may not be able to purchase defaulted consumer receivables at prices that management believes to be appropriate, and a decrease in our ability to purchase portfolios of receivables could adversely affect our net income. If our APG business segment is not able to purchase defaulted consumer receivables at planned levels and at prices that management believes to be appropriate, we could experience short-term and long-term decreases in income. The availability of receivables portfolios at prices which generate an appropriate return on our investment depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control, including the following:  the continuation of current growth trends in the levels of consumer obligations;  sales of receivables portfolios by debt owners;  competitive factors affecting potential purchasers and credit originators of receivables; and  the ability to continue to service portfolios to yield an adequate return. Because of the length of time involved in collecting defaulted consumer receivables on acquired portfolios and the volatility in the timing of our collections, we may not be able to identify trends and make changes in our purchasing strategies in a timely manner. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Future sales or issuances of our common stock may dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders and depress the trading price of our common stock. Future sales or issuances of our common stock may dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders. In addition, future sales or issuances of substantial amounts of our common stock may be at prices below current market prices and may adversely impact the market price of our common stock. Our mandatory convertible preferred stock, Series C has dividend and liquidation preference over our common stock. The 7.25 percent mandatory convertible preferred stock, Series C may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the 7.25 percent mandatory convertible preferred stock, Series C. For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by:  investors anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock received upon conversion of the 7.25 percent mandatory convertible preferred stock, Series C;  possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the 7.25 percent mandatory convertible preferred stock, Series C as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock; and  hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving the 7.25 percent mandatory convertible preferred stock, series C and our common stock. We do not currently pay regular dividends on our common stock. We have not paid dividends on our common stock since the execution of the Merger Agreement with the Buyer Group in April 2007. While the restriction on the payment of dividends under the Merger Agreement has been terminated, we expect to continue not paying dividends in the near term in order to focus on balance sheet improvement and expect to re-examine our dividend policy in the second half of 2008. Subject to 26 Delaware law, our board of directors will determine the payment of future dividends on our common stock, if any, and the amount of any dividends in light of any applicable contractual restrictions limiting our ability to pay dividends, our earnings and cash flows, our capital requirements, our financial condition, regulatory requirements and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. There can be no assurance the commitments we announced that we secured on January 28, 2008, for $31.3 billion of 364-day financing from a consortium of banks will ultimately be funded, or if they are not funded our credit rating will not be further downgraded. On January 28, 2008, we announced that we secured $31.3 billion of 364-day financing from a consortium of banks led by Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and The Royal Bank of Scotland, and from UBS. The commitments are intended to replace the $30.0 billion asset-backed commercial paper conduit facilities that we entered into with Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase in connection with the now terminated Merger as well as the $6.0 billion asset-backed commercial paper conduit facility. Funding under the commitments is subject to various conditions and there can be no assurance that all such conditions will be satisfied. In its February 4, 2008 announcement that our counterparty credit rating was lowered to BBB-, Standard & Poors Ratings Services noted that the decision to leave us on CreditWatch Negative reflects that the funding of the commitments is still subject to various conditions and that if the commitments do not close our ratings could be reduced further. We are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk because the interest rate characteristics of our earning assets do not always match exactly the interest rate characteristics of the funding. Depending on economic and other factors, we may fund our assets with debt that has a different index and/or reset frequency than the asset, but generally only where we believe there is a high degree of correlation between the interest rate movement of the two indices. For example, we use daily reset 3-month LIBOR to fund a large portion of our daily reset 3-month commercial paper indexed assets. We also use different index types and index reset frequencies to fund various other assets. In using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund our assets, we are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies, or will not move in the same direction or with the same magnitude. While these indices are short-term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time, there can be no assurance that this high correlation will not be disrupted by capital market dislocations or other factors not within our control. In such circumstances, our earnings could be adversely affected, possibly to a material extent. During the second half of 2007, the spread between 3-month commercial paper and 3-month LIBOR became very volatile and widened significantly due to the deterioration of the broad credit markets, which increased our cost of funds. This level of volatility had not been seen previously. We still believe there is a high level of correlation between 3-month commercial paper and 3-month LIBOR over the long term. In addition, we fund a limited amount of daily reset 3-month commercial paper, T-bill indexed and Prime indexed assets with auction rate securities and asset-backed commercial paper borrowings. Auction rate securities and asset-backed commercial paper borrowings do not reset to an explicit underlying index. At December 31, 2007, we had $3.3 billion of taxable and $1.7 billion of tax-exempt auction rate securities outstanding on a Managed Basis. In February 2008, an imbalance of supply and demand in the auction rate securities market as a whole led to failures of the auctions pursuant to which certain of our auction rate securities interest rates are set. As a result, certain of our auction rate securities bear interest at the maximum rate allowable under their terms. The maximum allowable interest rate on our $3.3 billion of taxable auction rate securities is generally LIBOR plus 1.50 percent. The maximum allowable interest rate on many of our $1.7 billion of tax-exempt auction rate securities was recently amended to LIBOR plus 2.00 percent through May 31, 2008. After May 31, 2008, the maximum allowable rate on these securities will revert to a formula driven rate, which, if in effect as of February 28, 2008, would have produced various maximum rates ranging up to 5.26 percent. 27 In the past, we employed reset rate note structures in conjunction with the issuance of certain tranches of our term asset-backed securities. Reset rate notes are subject to periodic remarketing, at which time the interest rates on the reset rate notes are reset. In the event a reset rate note cannot be remarketed on its remarketing date, the interest rate generally steps up to and remains LIBOR plus 0.75 percent, until such time as the bonds are successfully remarketed. The Company also has the option to repurchase the reset rate note upon a failed remarketing and hold it as an investment until such time it can be remarketed. The Companys repurchase of a reset rate note requires additional funding, the availability and pricing of which may be less favorable to the Company than it was at the time the reset rate note was originally issued. As of December 31, 2007, on a Managed Basis, the Company had $2.6 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion of reset rate notes due to be remarketed in 2008, 2009 and 2010, and an additional $8.5 billion to be remarketed thereafter. We may face limited availability of financing, variation in our funding costs and uncertainty in our securitization financing. In general, the amount, type and cost of our funding, including securitization and unsecured financing from the capital markets and borrowings from financial institutions, have a direct impact on our operating expenses and financial results and can limit our ability to grow our assets. A number of factors could make such securitization and unsecured financing more difficult, more expensive or unavailable on any terms both domestically and internationally (where funding transactions may be on terms more or less favorable than in the United States), including, but not limited to, financial results and losses, changes within our organization, specific events that have an adverse impact on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that have an adverse impact on the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our assets, our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agencies actions, general economic conditions and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies, and may become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors. Finally, we compete for funding with other industry participants, some of which are publicly traded. Competition from these institutions may increase our cost of funds. We are dependent on term asset-backed securities market for the long-term financing of student loans. We expect securitizations to provide approximately 90 percent or more of our funding needs in 2008. If the term asset-backed securities market were to experience a prolonged disruption, if our asset quality were to deteriorate or if our debt ratings were to be downgraded, we may be unable to securitize our student loans or to do so on favorable pricing and terms. If we were unable to continue to securitize our student loans at current pricing levels or on favorable terms, we would need to use alternative funding sources to fund new student loan originations and meet our other liquidity needs. If we were unable to find cost-effective and stable funding alternatives, our funding capabilities and liquidity would be negatively impacted and our cost of funds could increase, adversely affecting our results of operations and ability to originate student loans. In addition, the occurrence of certain events such as consolidations and reconsolidations may cause certain of our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled, which could accelerate the need for additional funding to the extent that we effected the refinancing. The rating agencies could downgrade the ratings on our senior unsecured debt, which could increase our cost of funds. Securitizations are the primary source of our long-term financing and liquidity. Our ability to access the securitization market and the ratings on our asset-backed securities are not directly or fully dependent upon the Companys general corporate credit ratings. The Company also utilizes senior unsecured long-term and short-term debt, which is dependent upon rating agency scoring. As of February 28, 2008, our senior unsecured long-term debt was rated Baa1, BBB−, and BBB and senior unsecured short-term debt was rated P-2, A-3 and F-3 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc., Standard and Poors Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and Fitch Ratings, respectively, and all three rating agencies ratings were under review for possible downgrade. If any or all of these ratings were downgraded for any reason, our overall cost of issuing senior unsecured debt could increase. 28 Our derivative counterparties may terminate their positions with the Company if its credit ratings fall to certain levels and the Company could incur substantial additional costs to replace any terminated positions. The majority of our ISDA Master Agreements provide that the counterparty may declare a Termination Event and terminate its positions if a Designated Event occurs and the Companys unsecured and unsubordinated long-term debt rating fall to either of the pre-determined levels, which are typically Baa3 for Moodys and BBB- from S&P. For purposes of these ISDA Master Agreements, the execution of the Merger Agreement constituted a Designated Event. On February 4, 2008, Standard & Poors Ratings Services announced that it lowered our long-term debt rating to BBB-/A-3 from BBB+/A-2. Standard & Poors also announced that our rating remains on CreditWatch with negative implications. As of February 28, 2008, 92 percent of the counterparties (on a notional basis) have agreed in writing to waive their rights (or do not have the rights) to declare a Termination Event arising from the Company executing the Merger Agreement and the resulting ratings downgrade. The remainder of the counterparties have agreed verbally to waive their rights at this time. Depending upon interest rates and exchange rates, the Company could be liable for substantial payments to terminate these positions if the counterparties exercise their right to terminate at any point in the future. It would be the Companys intent to replace any terminated positions with derivatives executed with other counterparties, however, the Company may not be able to readily replace any terminated positions or may incur substantial additional costs to do so. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by these additional payments and costs. In addition, prior to the recent ratings downgrade, we had the use of cash collateral posted by these counterparties. As a result of our recent ratings downgrade, our ability to use that cash collateral may become restricted. We are currently in negotiations with our counterparties to waive these restrictions so that use of such cash collateral once again becomes unrestricted. If not waived, these cash collateral balances will appear in the Restricted cash and investments line of our consolidated balance sheet. If our securitization trusts experience shortfalls on the assets which would result in the noteholders not receiving expected interest or principal payments, we may step in and make an advance to the trust to enable the trust to make these expected payments. The investors in our securitization trusts have no recourse to the Companys other assets should there be a failure of the trusts to pay when due and as a result we have no obligation related to these securitization trusts to fund any type of shortfall to the bondholders. To date, there have not been any noteholder payment shortfalls and we currently do not expect any payment shortfalls. In addition, we currently do not have any intent to fund shortfalls that might arise. We may decide, however, that it is in the best interest of the Company to fund any such shortfall. For example, by funding any shortfalls it may make it more cost effective to issue new securitizations in the future. Funding any shortfalls would reduce the amount of cash and liquidity we have on balance sheet and could result in a loss and reduction of equity as well. In addition, if we funded a shortfall related to an off-balance sheet trust, we would re-examine our accounting treatment to determine whether the trust would still be considered a Qualified Special Purpose Entity under SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities  a Replacement of SFAS No. 125. As a result, we may determine that we are required to consolidate that trust on our balance sheet as of the date we funded any shortfall. We might also conclude that such actions could result in consolidation of all our off-balance sheet trusts onto our balance sheet. GENERAL Our business is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and conditions, some of which are not within our control, including general economic conditions, increased competition, adverse changes in the laws and regulations that govern our businesses and failure to successfully identify, consummate and integrate strategic acquisitions. Our business is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and conditions, some of which we cannot control. For example, if the U.S. economy were to sustain a prolonged economic downturn, a number of our businesses  including our fastest growing businesses, Private Education Loan business and Asset Performance Group  could be adversely affected. We bear the full risk of loss on our portfolio of Private Education Loans. A prolonged economic downturn could make it difficult for borrowers to meet their payment 29 obligations for a variety of reasons, including job loss and underemployment. In addition, a prolonged economic downturn could extend the amortization period on APGs purchased receivables. Our principal business is comprised of acquiring, originating, holding and servicing education loans made and guaranteed under the FFELP. Most significant aspects of our principal business are governed by the HEA. We must also meet various requirements of the guaranty agencies, which are private not-for-profit organizations or state agencies that have entered into federal reinsurance contracts with ED, to maintain the federal guarantee on our FFELP loans. These requirements establish origination and servicing requirements, procedural guidelines and school and borrower eligibility criteria. The federal guarantee of FFELP loans is conditioned on loans being originated, disbursed or serviced in accordance with ED regulations. If we fail to comply with any of the above requirements, we could incur penalties or lose the federal guarantee on some or all of our FFELP loans. In addition, our marketing practices are subject to the HEAs prohibited inducement provision and our failure to comply with such regulation could subject us to a limitation, suspension or termination of our eligible lender status. Even if we comply with the above requirements, a failure to comply by third parties with whom we conduct business could result in us incurring penalties or losing the federal guarantee on some or all of our FFELP loans. If we experience a high rate of servicing deficiencies, we could incur costs associated with remedial servicing, and, if we are unsuccessful in curing such deficiencies, the eventual losses on the loans that are not cured could be material. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in our liability to borrowers and potential class action suits, all of which could adversely affect our future growth rates. Because of the risks, uncertainties and conditions described above, there can be no assurance that we can maintain our future growth rates at rates consistent with our historic growth rates. Our GAAP earnings are highly susceptible to changes in interest rates because most of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133. Changes in interest rates can cause volatility in our GAAP earnings as a result of changes in the market value of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, changes in derivative market values are recognized immediately in earnings. If a derivative instrument does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133, there is no corresponding change in the fair value of the hedged item recognized in earnings. As a result, gain or loss recognized on a derivative will not be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the underlying hedged item. Because most of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, when interest rates change significantly, our GAAP earnings may fluctuate significantly.
