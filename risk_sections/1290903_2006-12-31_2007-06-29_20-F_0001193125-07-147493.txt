PART II Item 13. Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies Not applicable. Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds Use of Proceeds The following discussion relates to the initial public offering our ADSs by us and certain selling shareholders, pursuant to a registration statement on Form F-1 (File No. 333-119606), which was completed on November 2, 2004. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on October 27, 2004. We received net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses related to the offering) of approximately US$42 million from the offering 4,602,547 ADSs, representing 9,205,094 ordinary shares. None of the transaction expenses included payments to our directors, executive officers, persons owning 10% or more of our equity securities or our affiliates. Deutsche Bank Securities, WR Hambrecht + Co, and Allen & Company LLC were the underwriters for the offering. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our ADSs by the selling shareholders. From November 2, 2004 through May 31, 2007, we have used a minor portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to fund the acquisitions of the Raytime and Fortunetrip enterprises, and also to fund a minor percentage of our operations. The majority of our operations are funded through our operating revenues. Item 15T. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer, or Interim CEO, Henrik Kjellberg and our CFO, Chris Chan, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2006. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the material financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in this annual report on Form 20-F and filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner. Based on this evaluation, our management, including our Interim CEO and CFO, concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 86 Table of Contents Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Interim CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006. Our management has reviewed its assessment with our audit committee. This annual report on Form 20-F does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Our managements report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report. Limitations on Controls. Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the sound control procedures. Any control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within eLong have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. As required by Rule 13a-15(d), under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Interim CEO and CFO, also conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the period covered by this report have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, we considered what revisions, improvements or corrections were necessary in order for us to conclude that our internal controls are effective. As part of this process, we identified a number of areas where there was a need for improvement in our internal control over financial reporting. We have completed the remediation of these areas. Other than the internal control over financial reporting improvements discussed above, it has been determined that there has been no such change during the period covered by this annual report. Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert. Our board of directors has determined that all three members of our audit committee, Messrs. David Goldhill, Thomas Gurnee and I. Martin Pompadur, are audit committee financial experts under Nasdaqs Marketplace Rules. Our board of directors has determined that all three members of our audit committee are independent under Nasdaqs Marketplace Rules and Section 10A(m) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Item 16B. Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our board of directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics applicable to every employee of our company, including our CEO, Interim CEO and our CFO, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, consistent with the requirements of the Nasdaq National Market. During 2006 we made certain minor revisions or amendments to our code of ethics, which are applicable to every employee of our company, to clarify our existing rules relating to data security, appropriate payment levels, and contract approval procedures. Our code of ethics is posted on our website at: www.eLong.com, under the Investor Relations page. 87 Table of Contents Item 16C. Principal Accountant Fees and Services.

These fees relate primarily to providing certain agreed upon procedures for acquisitions and Expedia Asia Pacifics investment in us. Our audit committee is responsible for the retention of our independent registered public accounting firm, which currently is KPMG. Our audit committee has adopted its own rules of procedure, in the form of an audit committee charter. The audit committees rules of procedure provide for a process with respect to the prior approval of all non-audit services to be performed by our independent auditors. Our audit committee reports to our board of directors regarding the scope and results of our annual audits, compliance with our accounting and financial policies and managements procedures and policies related to the adequacy of our internal accounting controls. Our audit committee was formed during 2004. In 2006 our audit committee pre-approved all of the audit services provided by KPMG.

The repurchase from existing shareholders were made pursuant to the agreements entered into with these shareholders in July 2004 in connection with Expedia Asia Pacifics initial investment in us and the issuance of the warrant to Expedia Asia Pacific. In April 2006, a post-closing adjustment was made such that the warrant exercise price and share repurchase price was adjusted to $6.20434 per share (the equivalent of $12.40868 per ADS). The warrant exercise price and share repurchase price are no longer subject to any adjustments. Notwithstanding the adjustment in the warrant exercise price, we did not repurchase any of our equity securities during the year ended December 31, 2006.

Date: June 29, 2007 eLong, Inc. /s/ Henrik Kjellberg Henrik Kjellbrg Interim Chief Executive Officer /s/ Chris Chan Chris Chan Chief Financial Officer Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders eLong, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of eLong, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, all expressed in Renminbi. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In February 2006, GCH was merged into eLong Information. In May 2006, the Company sold Raytime BVI, Golden VIP, and ZM VIP (collectively, Raytime) for RMB 1,500,000, to the original selling shareholders of Raytime. The Company, through its subsidiaries, conducts its operations in the PRC through a series of agreements with the VIEs identified above, namely Beijing Media, Beijing Information, Beijing Air, Beijing Travel and Hangzhou Air. These VIEs are designed and used solely to facilitate the Companys participation in Internet content provision, short messaging, call center services, advertising business, travel agency and air-ticketing services, which are industries in the PRC in which foreign ownership is restricted. The Company does not have any direct equity interest in the VIEs. However, pursuant to certain agreements and arrangements described below, the Company has the economic controlling interest over, and is the primary beneficiary of, these entities. Summary of VIEs Beijing Media is a domestic company incorporated in Beijing in August 2000. Beijing Media holds an advertising license and is primarily engaged in the business of advertising. One of the members of the Companys Board of Directors and a former employee holds 75% and 25% respectively, of the equity interest in Beijing Media.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 Hangzhou Air (formerly Global Link) is a domestic company incorporated in Hangzhou. In April 2005, Beijing Air acquired 100% interest in Global Link for RMB 830,000, and renamed the company Hangzhou eLong Air Service Co., Ltd. Beijing Air held 80% of such interest directly and 20% of the interest through an employee. In April 2006, the nominee shareholder, transferred its 20% interest in Global Link to Beijing Air and as a result, Beijing Air directly holds 100% interest in Hangzhou Air. Hangzhou Air is primarily engaged in domestic and international air ticketing and other travel-related services. The equity interests in the VIEs were all funded by loans issued by the Company to specific nominee shareholders, namely, one of the members of the Companys Board of Directors, and employees of the Group. The Company has an economic controlling interest over the VIEs through a series of related agreements, including exclusive technical services agreements, equity pledge agreements, operating agreements and loan agreements. Through these agreements, the Company is the primary beneficiary of these entities as it absorbs a majority of the VIEs expected losses and receives a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns. As a result, the financial position and results of operations of Beijing Information, Beijing Media, Beijing Air, Beijing Travel and Hangzhou Air have been consolidated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The long term loans to one of the members of the Board of Directors and to certain employees of the Group as discussed above are eliminated on consolidation. (2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs. All significant transactions and balances between the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs have been eliminated upon consolidation. (b) Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). (c) Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management of the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include allowances for doubtful accounts and deferred income tax assets, provision for loyalty points, stock-based compensation, the allocation of the purchase price for the Companys business acquisitions, useful lives and residual values of property and equipment and intangible assets, and the recovery of the carrying values of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets. Actual results could differ from estimates. (d) Foreign currencies The Groups functional and reporting currency is the Renminbi (RMB.) Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into RMB using the applicable exchange rates quoted by the Peoples Bank of China at the balance sheet dates. All such exchange gains and losses are included in the other income (expenses) in the consolidated statements of operations. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars (U.S. dollars) are solely for the convenience of the reader and were calculated at the rate of US$1.00 = RMB7.8041, representing the noon buying rate in the City of New York for cable transfers of RMB, as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on December 29, 2006. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into U.S. dollars at that rate on December 29, 2006, or at any other rate. F-8 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 (e) Commitments and contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. (f) Revenue recognition The Groups revenues are principally derived from the provision of travel services, including hotel reservation, air-ticketing and other related travel services. The Group recognizes revenues when all of the following have occurred: persuasive evidence of an agreement or arrangement with the customer exists, services have been performed, the fees for services performed are fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fees is reasonably assured. These criteria as related to the Groups revenues are considered to have been met as follows: Hotel reservation services The Group receives commissions from travel suppliers for hotel room reservations booked through the Group. Commissions from hotel reservation services rendered are recognized after hotel customers have completed their stay at the applicable hotel. The Group presents revenues from such transactions on a net basis in the statements of operations, as the Group acts as an agent, does not assume any inventory risk, and has no obligations for cancelled hotel reservations. Contracts with certain travel suppliers contain escalating commissions that are subject to achieving specific performance targets. Such escalating commissions are recognized when the performance targets have been achieved. Air-ticketing services The Group receives commissions from travel suppliers for air-ticketing services booked through the Groups transaction and service platform. Commissions from air-ticketing services rendered are recognized upon the delivery of the ticket to the customer, net of estimated cancellations. Estimated cancellations were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006. The Group presents revenues from such transactions on a net basis in the statements of operations, as the Group acts as an agent, does not assume any inventory risk, and has no obligations for cancelled airline ticket reservations. Contracts with certain airlines contain discretionary escalating commissions that are subject to achieving specific performance targets. Such discretionary escalating commissions are recognized on a cash basis because the Company cannot reasonably estimate such commissions. Vacation package service The Group receives commissions from travel product providers for vacation package products and services booked through the Group. Commissions are recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the air ticket to the customer, net of estimated cancellations. The Group presents revenues from such transactions on a net basis in the statements of operations, as the Group acts as an agent and does not assume any inventory risk for cancelled vacation package bookings. Other travel services Revenue from the sale of VIP and co-branded membership cards is recognized when the cards are sold, since the Group has no remaining contractual obligation to perform services. Other non travel services Other non-travel services primarily comprise wireless services and Internet-related advertising services. Revenue from Internet-related advertising contracts, which is paid in cash, is recognized over the contractual advertisement display period. Revenue from the provision of wireless services is recognized when the services have been delivered, the amount can be reliably measured and there is no uncertainty of settlement with the telecom operators. F-9 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 The Groups service related revenues are subject to a 5% business tax on revenues generated from services in China. In addition, advertising service revenue is subject to a cultural development surcharge at 3% of the advertising service revenue. Business tax and surcharges are reflected as an operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. (g) Income taxes Deferred income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes, the tax benefits associated with the utilization of pre-acquisition net operating losses carryforwards for which a valuation allowance was established at the date of the acquisition are recognized in the consolidated financial statements after the acquisition date as follows: (i) first to reduce to zero any goodwill related to the acquisition; (ii) second to reduce to zero other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisition; and (iii) third to reduce income tax expense. (h) Share-based compensation Adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for employee share-based arrangements using the preferable fair value recognition provision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, which replaced SFAS No. 123 and superseded APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees(APB No. 25). The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective approach, and accordingly, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123R. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, all grants of stock options and performance units are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their grant date fair values. The valuation provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to new awards, to awards granted to employees before the adoption of SFAS No. 123R whose related requisite services had not been provided, and to awards which were subsequently modified or cancelled. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 (SAB No. 107) relating to SFAS No. 123R. The Company has applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in its adoption of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the date of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Share-based compensation cost was recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that expense was recorded only for those share-based awards that are expected to vest. Previously under SFAS No. 123, to the extent awards were forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed in the period of forfeiture. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of RMB 282,072 to account for the expected forfeitures of share-based awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 for which the Company previously recorded as an expense. As required by SFAS No. 123R, a balance of RMB 27,618,582 of deferred compensation on January 1, 2006, date of adoption, was eliminated against additional paid-in capital. Under SFAS No. 123R, the Company applies the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of options granted. Risk-free interest rates are based on US Treasury yield for the terms consistent with the expected life of award at the time of grant. Expected life is based on historical exercise patterns, which the Company believes are representative of future behavior. Expected dividend yield is determined in view of the Companys historical dividend payout rate. The Company estimates expected volatility at the date of grant based on a combination of historical and implied volatilities. The Company recognizes compensation cost on all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical forfeiture and adjusted to reflect consideration for foreseeable future changes in facts and circumstances, if any. F-10 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 Compensation cost related to 2005 and 2006 employee Performance Units, which are awards in the form of units that are denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of the Companys ordinary shares, which number of units are determined based on the fair market value of the Companys ordinary shares on the date immediately preceding the grant date and which, when vested, are settled, in the Companys sole discretion, in either ordinary shares or cash. At the time of grant, the Companys board of directors or the compensation committee determines if the Company will settle the Performance Units in cash, stock or both. Settlement terms of Performance Units, once established, may only be changed by approval of the Companys board of directors or the compensation committee. Except with respect to the Performance Units granted to the Companys independent directors which are to be settled in cash, Performance Units granted to staff during 2006 are to be settled in ordinary shares. Those Performance Units granted during 2006 to the Companys independent directors are to be settled upon vesting by that amount of cash that is equal to the fair market value of the vested ordinary shares on the vesting date. Forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical forfeiture and adjusted to reflect consideration for foreseeable future changes in facts and circumstances, if any. Share-based compensation awards which are settled in cash upon vesting are classified as liabilities and included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Compensation cost related to liability-classified awards is determined based on the current share price and other pertinent factors at the balance sheet date, and the proportionate amount of the requisite service that has been rendered to date. Changes in fair value of the liability-classified awards after the requisite service period has been completed are immediately recognized as compensation cost in the period in which the change in fair value occurs. The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employee vendors in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R and Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. All transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the date on which the counterpartys performance is completed. (i) Provisions for loyalty points Cardholders of the VIP, regular, and co-branded cards issued by the Group earn loyalty points based on their usage of the cards. The Group provides travel awards and other non-cash gifts to the cardholders upon redemption of loyalty points that are accumulated based on cardholders transactions with the Group. The estimated costs to provide free travel and other non-cash gifts are recognized based on historical redemption data and are included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. (j) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and in bank and demand deposit with an initial term of less than three months. For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Group considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. (k) Trade accounts receivable Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are non-interest bearing. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Groups best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Groups existing accounts receivable. The Group reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts periodically and determines the allowance mainly based on historical write-off experience by customer types, the aging of the accounts receivable balance and the customers credit worthiness. Specific accounts are reviewed individually for collectibility. Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Group does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. (l) Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Group also capitalizes certain costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal-use software in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) No.98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, and Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 00-2, Accounting for Web Site Development Costs. Costs incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. F-11 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives, taking into account any estimated residual value: Capitalized software development cost 3 years Computer equipment and system software 3-5 years Furniture, fixtures and office equipment 5 years Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the assets, generally 3 to 5 years. (m) Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired. The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. The Company completes its annual impairment assessment for goodwill and intangible assets in December of each year. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined based upon a combination of multiple of earnings, discounted future cash flows and the projected profitability of the market in which it operates. In the case that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the book value of the goodwill. In determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill, the fair values of the tangible net assets and recognized and unrecognized intangible assets are deducted from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and is written down to its implied fair value. The impairment test on an intangible asset that is not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. (n) Impairment of long-lived assets The Group evaluates for impairment of its long-lived assets to be held and used, including equipment and software, separately identifiable intangible assets which are subject to amortization and other non-current assets, when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in managements judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less the cost to sell, and are no longer depreciated. (o) Employee benefit plans As stipulated by the regulations of the PRC, the Group participates in various defined contribution plans organized by municipal and provincial governments for its employees. Under these plans, certain pension, medical and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. The Group is required to make contributions to these plans at rates ranging from 31.9% to 46.5% of the salaries, bonuses and certain allowances of the employees. The Group has no other material obligation for the payment of employee benefits associated with these plans beyond the annual contributions described above. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Group contributed RMB 9,251,581, RMB 12,557,754 and RMB16,212,136, respectively to these plans. F-12 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 (p) Statutory reserves Under PRC law, the Companys wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries are required to provide for certain statutory reserves, namely a general reserve, an enterprise expansion fund and a staff welfare and bonus fund. These subsidiaries are required to allocate at least 10% of their after tax profits on individual company basis as determined under PRC GAAP to the general reserve and have the right to discontinue allocations to the general reserve if such reserve has reached 50% of registered capital on individual company basis. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of these subsidiaries. The Companys VIEs in the PRC are also subject to similar statutory reserve requirements. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to the Company in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends. As of December 31, 2005, the subsidiaries in PRC had appropriated RMB 1,177,222 in statutory reserves, which, although are restricted from being distributed to the Company, have no impact on presentation of the Companys retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet. As a result, the statutory reserves as of December 31, 2005 have been reclassified in accumulated deficit. (q) Earnings (loss) per share In accordance with SFAS No.128, Computation of Earnings Per Share, basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available (applicable) to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Ordinary equivalent shares consist of the ordinary shares issuable upon the conversion of the preferred shares (using the as-converted method) and ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, stock warrants and the settlement of Performance Units. Ordinary equivalent shares in the diluted income (loss) per share computation are excluded in net loss periods as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Ordinary shares include high-vote ordinary shares. (r) Segment reporting The Group operates and manages its business as two reportable segments Hotel and Air. In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segment of an Enterprise and Related Information (SFAS No. 131), the Groups chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the CEO, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Group. The Group does not allocate any operating expenses or assets to its hotel and air segments as management does not use this information to measure the performance of the reportable segments. The Group substantially generates all revenues from customers in the PRC. Accordingly, no geographical segments are presented. (s) Operating leases The Group leases office space under operating lease agreements with original lease periods up to five years. Rental expenses are recognized from the date of initial possession of the leased property on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain lease agreements contain rent holidays, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease renewal periods are considered on a lease-by-lease basis and are generally not included in the initial lease term. (t) Financial instruments Financial instruments of the Group are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investment securities, accounts payable, advances from customers, and accrued expenses and other payables. As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, their carrying value approximated their fair value due to their short term nature. F-13 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 (u) Recently issued accounting standards In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ratified the consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-03, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation). EITF 06-03 provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis (included in revenues and costs) or on a net basis (excluded from revenues) is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed. The provisions of EITF 06-03 will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006 and was adopted by the Group on January 1, 2007. For all periods presented, the Group records revenue gross of such taxes. The Group does not expect the adoption of this EITF Issue to have material impact on the Groups consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation requires that the Group recognizes in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 was adopted by the Group in the first quarter of 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each on a companys balance sheet and statement of operations and the related financial statement disclosures. Early application of the guidance in SAB 108 is encouraged in any report for an interim period of the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006, and was adopted by the Group on December 31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have any impact on the Groups consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by the Group in fiscal year 2008. The Group is still in the process of determining the impact, if any, of SFAS No. 157 on its results from operations, financial position or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.115, which permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No.159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by the Group in fiscal year 2008. The Group is currently evaluating whether to elect fair value option as permitted under SFAS No. 159. (3) ACQUISITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS I. ACQUISITIONS Shanghai Xinwang Computer Technology Co., Ltd. (Fortune Trip) and Bravado Investments Limited (Bravado) On July 7, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Fortune Trip and Bravado. The total purchase price for Fortune Trip and Bravado was US$2,567,637 (RMB 21,417,606), plus capitalized acquisition costs of RMB1,394,134. The total purchase price excluded (i) contingent consideration of $375,000 (RMB 3,026,325) contingent upon certain employment conditions and (ii) contingent adjustment to the net asset value according to the finalization of certain liabilities assumed. The employment condition was not met and as a result the $375,000 was not required to be paid. The adjustment to the net asset value was RMB 563,786 and was recorded as additional purchase consideration upon payment in 2006. The following table summarizes the adjusted fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. F-14 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 Total purchase price 21,981,392 Acquisition costs 1,394,134 Total purchase price 23,375,526 Current assets acquired 3,300,804 Property and equipment 1,176,904 Identifiable intangible assets acquired 4,500,000 Total assets acquired 8,977,708 Short-term loan assumed (6,000,000 ) Other current liabilities assumed (3,168,788 ) Total liabilities assumed (9,168,788 ) Net liabilities assumed (191,080 ) Goodwill, not tax deductible 23,566,606 The results of Fortune Trip and Bravado have been included in the consolidated statements of operations since July 7, 2005, the date of acquisition. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information reflects the results of operations for the Group for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, as if the acquisition of Fortune Trip and Bravado had occurred on January 1, 2004, and after giving effect to purchase accounting adjustments. These unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been had the acquisition actually taken place on January 1, 2004, and may not be indicative of future operating results. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 (Unaudited) Revenues 151,653,198 218,823,314 Net loss (25,508,929 ) (65,133,441 ) Loss per share-Basic and Diluted (1.39 ) (1.31 ) II. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Raytime In May 2006, the Group sold Raytime BVI and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Golden VIP, and ZM VIP (collectively, Raytime) for RMB 1,500,000 to the original selling shareholders of Raytime. The sale proceeds was not received in cash, but reduced the remaining RMB 4,000,000 payable by the Group to the original selling shareholders of Raytime by RMB 1,500,000. The Group recorded a gain on disposal of RMB 2,649,682 in May 2006, representing the excess of the selling price over the carrying amount of the Groups investment in these entities on the date of sale. As a result of the sale, all remaining contingent consideration payable was cancelled. Online Dating Division During the third quarter of 2006, the Group sold the interactive online dating community business to an entity, whose controlling shareholder is also the controlling shareholder of the Group for US$14,625,000 (RMB 114,780,017). As this transaction was between entities under common control, the proceeds in excess of the carrying value of the net assets sold of RMB 94,170,501 was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. The financial results of Raytime and the interactive online dating community businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and related disclosures for all periods presented. As a result, the footnote disclosures have been revised to exclude the amounts related to the financial results of the Raytime and interactive online dating community businesses for all periods presented. The consolidated statements of cash flows include both discontinued operations for all periods presented through the date of disposition. F-15 Table of Contents eLong, Inc.

(6) GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The following table presents the Groups goodwill and intangible assets as of December 31, 2005 and 2006: December 31, 2005 2006 Goodwill 34,083,131 30,000,019 Intangible assets with definite lives, net 4,405,944 3,345,944 Intangible assets with indefinite lives 400,000 400,000 Total goodwill and intangibles, net 38,889,075 33,745,963 The Groups indefinite lived intangible asset relates to a trade name acquired in the acquisition of Fortune Trip. The Group performs an annual assessment of possible impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in December of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. The Group also performs an impairment test on its definitive lived intangible assets when events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. In 2005, the Group operated as one operating segment. Raytime BVI, Golden VIP and ZM VIP comprised the Raytime reporting unit which is one level below the Groups operating segment. The goodwill arising from these acquisitions and the related assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, were allocated to the Raytime reporting unit. Based on the lower than estimated performance of Raytime, the Group determined the definite lived intangible related to Raytime might be impaired. Accordingly, the Group performed an impairment analysis. The method used in the Groups testing of goodwill impairment related to the Raytime reporting unit was as follows: 1) The Group, supported by an independent valuation performed by a third party valuation firm, determined the fair value of the Raytime reporting unit by estimating the expected discounted future cash flows of the Raytime reporting unit. In estimating the discounted future cash flows, the Group followed FASB Concepts Statement No. 7, Using Cash Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements, by taking into account the Groups expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those cash flows, and the risk-free interest rate; 2) The Group then compared the fair value of the Raytime reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill; 3) Since the fair value of the Raytime reporting unit was less than the carrying value, the second step was performed in which the Group compared the implied fair value of the Raytime reporting units goodwill to the book value of the goodwill. As a result of the impairment tests undertaken of identifiable goodwill and the Raytime definite lived intangible asset, the Group recorded impairment charges of RMB 14,462,720 and RMB 3,081,943 respectively in 2005, which is included in loss before income tax expenses in the accompanying statement of operations. No impairment charges were recorded in 2006. F-17 Table of Contents eLong, Inc.

Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands Under the current laws of Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands, the Company and Bravado are not subject to tax on their income or capital gains. In addition, no Cayman Islands or British Virgin Islands withholding tax is imposed upon any payments of dividends. China In accordance with Income Tax Law of China for Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises, eLong Information, Golden VIP and Fortune Trip, as wholly-owned foreign invested enterprises, are subject to enterprise income tax (EIT) at a rate of 33%. eLong Information obtained the status of a High New Technology Development Enterprise in November 2006 that entitles it to a preferential EIT rate of 15% from January 1, 2006. The Companys VIEs, except for Beijing Information, are subject to EIT at the rate of 33%. Beijing Information has obtained the status of a High New Technology Development Enterprise that entitles it to a preferential EIT rate of 15%. Beijing Information has also been granted a tax holiday for exemption of EIT for three years from 2001 to the end of 2003, and a 50% deduction in the EIT rate for three years starting from 2004 resulting in an EIT rate of 7.5%. The Chinese tax system is subject to substantial uncertainties and has been subject to recently enacted changes (See note 18), the interpretation and enforcement of which are also uncertain. There can be no assurance that changes in Chinese tax laws or their interpretation or their application will not subject the Groups PRC entities to substantial Chinese taxes in the future.

F-20 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 The significant components of deferred income tax benefit attributable to income (loss) from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 are as follows: For the year ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Deferred tax (benefit) expense (exclusive of the effect of the component below) (835,871 ) (4,747,827 ) (1,447,454 ) Increase (decrease) in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 908,408 5,232,494 (2,199,694 ) 72,537 484,667 (3,647,148 ) The amount included in the change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an adjustment in the beginning-of-the-year balance of the valuation allowance because of a change in circumstances that caused a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset in future years. Such amounts were RMB493,352, RMB453,384 and RMB39,129, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005, and 2006, and is primarily due to certain allowances for doubtful accounts that were deemed nondeductible. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below. December 31, 2005 2006 Deferred tax assets: Accounts receivable principally due to allowance for doubtful accounts 39,129  Operating loss carryforwards 5,543,234 1,629,074 Operating loss carryforwards, pre-acquisition 7,788,546 1,500,254 Property and equipment 960,016 400,237 Accrued expenses 2,033,516 708,028 Total gross deferred tax assets 16,364,441 4,237,593 Less: valuation allowance (14,927,788 ) (1,594,808 ) Net deferred tax assets 1,436,653 2,642,785 Deferred tax liabilities: Indefinite life intangible assets 132,000 132,000 Definite life intangible assets 1,353,000 952,360 Total deferred tax liabilities 1,485,000 1,084,360 (48,347 ) 1,558,425 Deferred tax assets, net:  Current  708,028  Non-current 83,653 982,397 In accordance with SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes, the tax benefits associated with the utilization of pre-acquisition net operating losses carryforwards for which a valuation allowance was established at the date of the acquisition are recognized in the consolidated financial statements after the acquisition date as follows: (i) first to reduce to zero any goodwill related to the acquisition; (ii) second to reduce to zero other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisition; and (iii) third to reduce income tax expense. As of December 31, 2006, the amount of valuation allowance associated with pre-acquisition net operating losses was RMB547,894. F-21 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 The gross amount of operating loss carryforwards expire in 2007 to 2011 as follows: RMB345,000 in 2007, RMB1,146,621 in 2008, RMB2,414,460 in 2009, RMB4,301,917 in 2010 and RMB1,274,813 in 2011. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible or utilized. The Group considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Taxable income for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 was RMB37,624,761 and RMB112,744,171. Based upon an assessment of the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible or can be utilized, management has provided a valuation allowance of RMB 14,927,788 and RMB1,594,808 as of December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. After reducing the deferred tax assets by the valuation allowance, the deferred tax assets of RMB 83,653 and RMB1, 690,425 as of December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively, represent the deferred tax assets of entities that have been profitable and therefore are more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. (10) LEASES The Group has several non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for office rent. Lease payments under operating leases, including periodic rent escalation and free rent period, are charged as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2006 are: Minimumlease amount 2007 10,875,050 2008 8,659,552 2009 123,186 2010  2011  Total 19,657,788 Rental expenses incurred under operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 amounted to RMB 5,707,160, RMB5,672,598 and RMB 9,643,785 respectively. (11) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Stock options In April 2001, the Company adopted the stock option plan (the 2001 Plan) pursuant to which the Companys Board of Directors may grant stock options to selected directors, officers, key employees and consultants of the Group. The Plan authorizes the Company to grant options to purchase up to 4 million authorized but un-issued ordinary shares. On August 26, 2003, the Company increased the number of ordinary shares authorized to be issued under the 2001 Stock Option Plan to 5,500,000. In July 2004, the Company adopted a stock and annual incentive plan (the 2004 Plan) that allows the Board of Directors to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or Performance Units to officers, employees, directors or consultants of the Group to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of authorized but un-issued ordinary shares. F-22 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 The options under both 2001 Plan and 2004 Plan have a contractual life of ten years and vest and become exercisable ratably over three to five years from the date of grant, except the options granted in 2001, which became exercisable upon grant. The fair value of the Companys stock options, less expected forfeitures, is recognized as compensation cost over the awards respective vesting period on a straight-line basis. The amount of compensation cost for stock options is measured based on the fair value, as determined by the Black-Scholes option pricing model, on the grant date that the share-based awards are granted and adjusted for the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock options granted during 2004, 2005 and 2006 are summarized in the following table.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 The aggregated intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2006 was calculated based on the closing price of the Companys ordinary shares on December 29, 2006 of $6.505 per share. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005, and 2006 was nil, $9.5 million, and $2.8 million, respectively. As of December 2006, there was RMB 21.84 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.5 years. Total unrecognized compensation cost may be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. On October 1, 2004, the Company entered into a stock option agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific pursuant to which, in exchange for Expedia Asia Pacific giving its consent to the issuance of the 250,000 options to certain of the Companys officers, the Company granted to Expedia Asia Pacific an option to purchase up to 260,204 of the Companys ordinary shares at a purchase price of US$5.25 per share. The option mirrors the provisions of the option granted to the Companys officers on October 1, 2004. The option becomes exercisable by Expedia Asia Pacific each time any such officer exercises any of the 250,000 options. In connection with each exercise by an officer, Expedia Asia Pacific is entitled to exercise a portion of its option such that Expedia Asia Pacific would receive (if Expedia Asia Pacific exercises its option to the fullest extent in connection with such officer exercise) 51% of the aggregate ordinary shares issued to such officer and Expedia Asia Pacific in connection with such officer exercise. To the extent that any of the officers options terminate or expire without being exercised, an amount of Expedia Asia Pacifics option equal to 51% of (i) such officers terminated or expired options divided by (ii) 0.49 will likewise terminate or expire. The fair value of the 260,204 options granted to Expedia Asia Pacific will be recognized over the vesting term as deemed dividend or operating expenses, depending on circumstances as discussed below. Prior to November 2004, when Expedia became an ordinary shareholder of the Company as a result of the automatic conversion of all preferred shares into ordinary shares upon the completion of the Companys initial public offering, cost related to these mirror options of RMB 413,632 was recorded as a deemed dividend to preferred shareholders in arriving at net loss applicable to ordinary shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2004. For years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, RMB1,654,526 and RMB1,551,520, respectively, were recognized as operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The method and assumptions used to determine the fair value were consistent with those used to determine the fair value of the 250,000 officer options. F-24 Table of Contents eLong, Inc.

Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Tang provided the Company with a general release of any claims related to his employment with the Company. The Company acknowledged that (i) under the terms of the 2001 Plan and the terms of his employment agreement, Purple Mountain Holding Ltd.s (an entity over which Mr. Tang has ultimate investment power and to whom Mr. Tang had previously transferred a portion of his options) option to purchase 2,875,000 ordinary shares had vested and (ii) under the terms of the 2004 Plan and the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Tangs option to purchase 262,500 ordinary shares had vested. The Company also agreed that in consideration for the benefits provided by Mr. Tang under the termination and settlement agreement, Purple Mountain Holding Ltd.s option would also vest with respect to an additional 31,250 ordinary shares and Purple Mountain Holding Ltd. would have until 60 days after Mr. Tang ceases to be a director of the Company for any reason to exercise the outstanding vested options. In addition, the Company agreed that Mr. Tangs option would vest with respect to an additional 43,750 ordinary shares, and that Mr. Tang would have until 60 days after he ceases to be a director of the Company for any reason to exercise the outstanding vested options. The modification of Mr. Tangs share option resulted in compensation cost of RMB 898,912 being recognized in 2006. The remaining unvested option to additional purchase of 393,750 ordinary shares was therefore forfeited on February 17, 2006. Finally, the Company agreed to lift the transfer restrictions placed on Mr. Tang and Purple Mountain Holding Ltd. to allow for the sale or transfer of enough ordinary shares to enable a cashless exercise of all options held by Mr. Tang and Purple Mountain Holding Ltd. in the event Mr. Tang ceases to be a director of the Company as a result of being removed by the Board or the Companys shareholders and not as a result of his resignation. Performance Units Performance Units grants are rights to receive the Companys ordinary shares, or in some cases, a cash award linked to the Companys ordinary share value. Performance Units vest ratably over a five-year period, are not entitled to dividends or voting rights, and are generally converted to ordinary shares upon vesting on a one-for-one basis. When the Performance Unit grants are settled in cash, the cash amount is set at the equivalent of the fair market value of the number of the Companys ordinary shares that the grantee would have received on a particular vesting date, had the grant been settled in shares. The cost of the Performance Units awards was determined using the fair value of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of grant, net of expected forfeitures, and compensation cost was recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term. The fair value of Performance Units was determined based on the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares on the date immediately preceding the grant date and the number of the ordinary shares underlying the Performance Units issued. On May 10, 2006 (grant date), the Company issued 10,000 (if measured against ordinary shares) or 5,000 (if measured against ADSs) Performance Units to three independent directors respectively and classified this award as equity award on date of grant. According to a resolution of the Board of Directors on July 26, 2006 (modification date), the grant was amended such that these Performance Units shall be settled in cash. Accordingly, the Company reclassified the award from equity to liability in July 2006. The fair value of the award on grant date and modification date was RMB1,847,908 and RMB1,674,434, respectively. The Performance Units vest over a three-year period and will be settled by cash upon vesting. Compensation cost is determined based on (i) greater of the year-end market price or grant date fair value and (ii) proportionate amount of the requisite service that has been rendered to date. The related liability is adjusted to the market price at each year end. F-25 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 A summary of Performance Units activity under the 2004 Plan for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 is as follows: Number of Shares Weighted averagegrant date fair value Balance at December 31, 2004   Granted 104,895 US$ 5.00 Vested   Forfeited   Expired   Balance at December 31, 2005 104,895 US$ 5.00 Granted 304,545 US$ 6.94 Vested   Forfeited (84,516 ) US$ 5.20 Expired   Balance at December 31, 2006 324,924 US$ 6.83 The Company recorded stock-based compensation cost of RMB 9,668,971 and RMB 16,506,744 and RMB 12,364,466 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, with respect to the stock options and Performance Units granted under the 2001 and 2004 Plans. Warrants In August 2003, the Company issued warrants to purchase 600,000 of the Companys ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$0.75 per share to Broadband Capital Management LLC (Broadband), an investment banking and financial advisory firm, and two outside consultants, one of whom is a non-employee shareholder of the Company, in consideration for investment banking services provided to the Company in respect of the private placement of US$15 million aggregate principal amount of Series A preferred shares in August 2003 (See note 12). The Company also paid US$250,000 (RMB2,070,000) to Broadband for services provided in connection with this private placement. The Company accounted for the warrants issued to Broadband and the two consultants in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and EITF Issue No. 96-18. The fair value of the warrants granted was RMB4,818,960 on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model (excluding a volatility assumption as the Company was a non-public entity at the date the warrants were issued). The assumptions used in determining the fair value of the warrants were as follows: expected dividend yield 0%, risk free interest rate of 2.9%, and a contractual life of 10 years. The estimated fair value of the warrants of RMB4,818,960 and the cash payment of US$250,000 (RMB2,070,000) was charged against the gross proceeds of the Series A preferred shares as such costs were incremental and specifically and directly attributable to the actual placement of such securities. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, 98,973 and 10,540 warrants were exercised into 98,973 and 9,216 of ordinary shares after netting off shares equal to the exercise price due. As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, the number of warrants outstanding and exercisable was 25,661 and 15,121, respectively. Preferred Shares In May 2004, certain of the Companys shareholders, Tiger Technology Private Investment Partners, L.P., Tiger Technology II, L.P., Blue Ridge Limited Partnership, Blue Ridge Offshore Master Limited Partnership and RMG Holdings, LLC, collectively sold an aggregate of 150,000 Series A preferred shares to the Companys chief financial officer, at a price of US$1.53 per share. Due to the purchase of these 150,000 Series A preferred shares by the Companys chief financial officer from a principal shareholders group at a price below fair market value, the Company recorded a stock-based compensation cost of RMB3,923,108 in the year ended December 31, 2004. The amount of share based compensation cost represented the difference between the purchase price of US$1.53 and US$4.69, which was the Companys best estimate of the fair market value of the Series A preferred shares at the time of the sale. F-26 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 (12) PREFERRED SHARES Series A Preferred Shares On August 29, 2003, the Company received US$ 15,000,000 (RMB124,162,500) from four investorsTiger Technology Private Investment Partners, L.P., Tiger Technology II, L.P., Blue Ridge Limited Partnership, and RMG Holdings, LLC, in exchange for 9,787,494 Series A preferred shares. All of the then-outstanding Series A Preferred Shares were converted into an equal number of ordinary shares effective upon the completion of the Companys initial public offering on November 2, 2004. (See note 13) Series B Preferred Shares On August 4, 2004, the Company issued and sold 11,188,570 Series B preferred shares to Expedia Asia Pacific, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Expedia, Inc. (or Expedia) for an aggregate purchase price of US$58,690,062 (RMB485,777,647), or US$5.25 per Series B preferred share. Pursuant to the Expedia Asia Pacific purchase agreements, the Company used the proceeds from the sale of the Series B preferred shares to repurchase from existing shareholders an aggregate of 4,012,411 of its ordinary shares and 1,581,874 of the Companys Series A preferred shares. After the share repurchase, the Company retained US$29,345,033 (RMB242,888,916) of the aggregate purchase price. Of that amount US$4,401,754 (RMB 36,433,318) was deposited into an escrow account which was subject to (i) possible claims by Expedia Asia Pacific for indemnification under the agreement between the Company and Expedia Asia Pacific for representations, warranties and covenants provided by the Company, and (ii) payment to Expedia Asia Pacific for certain post-closing matters. On August 4, 2005 and April 30, 2006, 25% and 75% of the escrow funds were released to the Company, respectively. Also in connection with the sale of the Series B preferred shares, on August 4, 2004 the Company granted Expedia Asia Pacific a warrant which was exercisable by Expedia Asia Pacific during the first 30 business days following the completion of the Companys initial public offering. Expedia Asia Pacifics warrant entitled it to purchase that number of the Companys high-vote ordinary shares which would result in Expedia Asia Pacifics holding 51% of the Companys outstanding ordinary shares on a fully-diluted basis after giving effect to the repurchase from existing shareholders of a number of ordinary shares equal to one-half of the shares purchased by Expedia Asia Pacific pursuant to its warrant. In December 2004, Expedia Asia Pacific, which is now controlled by its ultimate parent, Expedia, exercised the warrant and, on January 7, 2005, purchased 17,362,134 of the Companys high-vote ordinary shares for an aggregate cash purchase price of US$107,818,852 (RMB 892,362,729). As a result of Expedia Asia Pacifics exercise of its warrant, the Company is controlled by Expedia, and Expedia has the power to control substantially the Companys management and business operations. The Company used the proceeds from Expedia Asia Pacifics warrant exercise to repurchase 8,681,067 ordinary shares from certain of the Companys existing shareholders. Out of the total proceeds of US$53,909,426 retained by the Company, US$8,086,414 was deposited into an escrow account which was subject to (i) possible claims by Expedia Asia Pacific for indemnification under the agreement between the Company and Expedia Asia Pacific for representations, warranties and covenants provided by the Company, and (ii) payment to Expedia Asia Pacific for certain post-closing matters. As of December 31, 2005, as a result of the adjustments made on March 31, 2006 to the warrant purchase price and the share repurchase price, the Company recorded US$98,270 (RMB766,909) due to Expedia Asia Pacific with a corresponding reduction to additional paid-in capital, and recorded US$49,135 (RMB383,454) due from certain of the Companys existing shareholders with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. On April 2006, US$9,527,365(RMB74,352,509) of the escrow funds was released to the Company, net of the above amounts due to Expedia and due from shareholders. On December 17, 2004, the Series B preferred shares were converted, on a one-to-one basis, into high-vote ordinary shares in conjunction with Expedia Asia Pacifics exercise of the warrant to purchase high-vote ordinary shares.(See note 13) F-27 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 (13) ORDINARY SHARES Ordinary Shares On August 4, 2004, in connection with the issuance of the Series B preferred shares, the Company purchased from certain existing shareholders 4,012,411 ordinary shares (inclusive of the 150,500 shares described above) and 1,581,874 of the Companys Series A preferred shares. Such ordinary shares and Series A preferred shares were subsequently cancelled (See note 12). 1,585,750 Series A Preferred Shares were converted into an equal number of ordinary shares effective upon the completion of the Companys initial public offering on November 2, 2004. These ordinary shares were sold by the selling shareholders to the public in the initial public offering. On the same day, 6,619,870 Series A Preferred Shares were automatically converted into an equal number of ordinary shares. On December 17, 2004, 11,188,570 Series B Preferred Shares were converted into an equal number of high-vote ordinary shares. Immediately prior to the closing of Expedia Asia Pacifics warrant purchase on January 7, 2005, the Company issued an aggregate of 98,973 ordinary shares to certain warrant holders at US$0.75 per share (US$74,229.75 or RMB 614,363) upon the exercise of the warrants. The Company subsequently repurchased these ordinary shares in connection with the issuance of the high-vote ordinary shares (See below). During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Company issued 425,366, 1,718,250 and 319,922 ordinary shares to certain of its option and warrant holders for an aggregate exercise price of US$ 319,025 (or RMB 2,640,406), US$1,387,922 (or RMB 11,462,361) and US$772,628 (or RMB 6,094,307), respectively. During 2006, to facilitate the employee stock option exercise process, the Company issued depositary shares to its brokers. These shares are not considered outstanding until issued to the employees as a result of the exercise of stock options. As of December 31, 2006, 915,043 depositary shares were issued to brokers and not to the shareholders. High-Vote Ordinary Shares Since November 2004, Expedia Asia Pacific or its affiliate, Expedia, held 11,188,570 high-vote ordinary shares as a result of the automatic conversion on December 17, 2004 of all outstanding Series B Preferred Shares. Following its purchase on January 7, 2005 pursuant to the exercise of its warrant of an additional 17,362,134 high-vote ordinary shares (See note 12), Expedia Asia Pacific beneficially holds 28,550,704 high-vote ordinary shares, which constitute all of the Companys outstanding high-vote ordinary shares and, as a result, controls approximately 95% of the voting power of all shares of the Companys voting stock. In addition, certain other shareholders are parties to an investor agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific under which they have agreed to vote their ordinary shares in the election of directors designated by Expedia Asia Pacific. Expedia Asia Pacific has the ability to control the composition of the Companys Board of Directors, including the right to select six of the thirteen members of the Board, the ability to nominate the remaining directors and vote their shares to elect them and the right to vote their shares to remove members of the Board of Directors. The rights of the ordinary shares and high-vote ordinary shares are the same except that each high-vote ordinary share is entitled to 15 votes, whereas each ordinary share is entitled to one vote. (14) LOSS PER ORDINARY SHARE Potentially dilutive securities that could potentially dilute basic income per ordinary share include stock options and Performance Units granted to employees and directors and stock warrants granted to non-employees. In 2004, 2005 and 2006, ordinary equivalent shares in the diluted loss per ordinary share computation are excluded as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Basic loss and diluted loss per ordinary share have been calculated as follows: For the year ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Net loss available to ordinary shareholders (18,766,789 ) (62,222,832 ) (1,106,889 ) Denominator for basic loss per share: Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 18,319,375 49,637,963 50,391,885 Basic and diluted loss per ordinary share (1.02 ) (1.25 ) (0.03 ) F-28 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 (15) CONCENTRATION OF RISKS Credit and concentration risks The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and other receivables represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, substantially all of the Groups cash and cash equivalents were held in major financial institutions located in the PRC, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the United States, which management believes are of high credit quality. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and denominated in RMB, and are derived from revenues earned from operations arising in the PRC. The Group performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. The Group maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts and actual losses have been within managements expectations. The Group has a diversified base of customers. No individual customer contributed to more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2005 and 2006. The Group does not have concentrations of available sources of labors, services, franchises, licenses or other rights that could, if suddenly eliminated, severely impact its operations. Business and economic risks The Group conducts its principal operations in the PRC and accordingly is subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with investments in equity securities of United States and Western European companies. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic, legal environment and social uncertainties in the PRC, influence of the China National Tourism Administration over certain aspects of the Groups operations and competition in the travel agency industry. The Group is currently targeting the Chinese market. The Chinese government regulates Internet access, the distribution of online news and other information, the provision of online commerce and provision of travel agency services through strict business licensing requirements and other governmental regulations. These regulations include limiting foreign ownership in Chinese companies providing Internet access, information and other online Internet services and travel agency services. Management, after consultation and advice from PRC legal counsel, is of the opinion that the Groups business complies with existing Chinese laws and regulations. However, the interpretation and application of current or proposed requirements and regulations may have an adverse effect on the Groups business, financial condition and result of operations. In addition, the ability to negotiate and implement specific business development projects in a timely and favorable manner may be impacted by political considerations unrelated to or beyond the control of the Group. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for the past two decades, no assurance can be given that the PRC government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered. There is also no guarantee that the PRC governments pursuit of economic reforms will be consistent or effective and as a result, changes in the rate or method of taxation, reduction in tariff protection and other import restrictions, and changes in State policies and regulations affecting the travel agency industry may have a negative impact on the Groups operating results and financial condition. F-29 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 Currency risk A substantial majority of the Groups revenues and expenditures are denominated in RMB. The RMBs exchange rate with the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in Chinas political and economic conditions. The exchange rate for conversion of RMB into foreign currencies is heavily influenced by intervention in the foreign exchange market by the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC). From 1995 until July 2005, the PBOC intervened in the foreign exchange market to maintain an exchange rate of approximately 8.3 RMB per U.S. dollar. On July 21, 2005, the Chinese government changed this policy and began allowing modest appreciation of the RMB versus the U.S. dollar. However, the RMB is restricted to a rise or fall of no more than 0.5% per day versus the U.S. dollar, and the PBOC continues to intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate. Nevertheless, under Chinas current exchange rate regime, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. The exchange rate of United States dollars against RMB was 7.81 on December 29, 2006 by Peoples Bank of China. Due to the amount of cash held in United States dollar by the Company as of December 31, 2006, the continuous appreciation of RMB will have a negative impact on the Groups operating results and financial condition. (16) SEGMENT INFORMATION During the year of 2006, the Group began to operate as two reportable segments: Hotel and Air. These reportable segments are business units that offer different products that are managed separately because each requires different service provision and marketing strategies. The Hotel segment mainly provides the services to customers for the reservation with hotels and the Air segment provides the services to customers for the air tickets booking with airline companies. Other segment provides wireless services and Internet-related advertising services. The change from a single reportable segment results from a change in internal organizational and financial reporting structure. The Group determined its segments based on how the Groups chief operating decision makers manage its business, make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance. No segment information related to year ended December 31, 2004 are presented, as it is impracticable to do so. A summary of the results of the reportable segments with all historical amounts reclassified to conform to the current segment presentation is as follows: Year ended December 31, 2006 Hotel Air Others Corporate Total(RMB) Revenues 209,275,155 38,287,644 16,980,881  264,543,680 Cost of services (28,762,854 ) (24,409,252 ) (1,258,042 ) (7,815,207 ) (62,245,355 ) Service development expenses (4,969,639 ) (5,705,147 ) (10,750,395 ) (20,496,472 ) (41,921,653 ) Total contribution 175,542,662 8,173,245 4,972,444 (28,311,679 ) 160,376,672 Year ended December 31, 2005 Hotel Air Others Corporate Total(RMB) Revenues 151,990,059 23,773,159 14,565,934  190,329,152 Cost of services (24,501,783 ) (10,967,942 ) (2,983,531 ) (1,993,732 ) (40,446,988 ) Service development expenses (3,743,451 ) (9,148,990 ) (11,647,088 ) (11,758,060 ) (36,297,589 ) Total contribution 123,744,825 3,656,227 (64,685 ) (13,751,792 ) 113,584,575 F-30 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2006 (17) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Companies are considered to be related if one company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other company or exercise significant influence over the other company in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. Because of related party relationships, it is possible that the terms of these transactions are not the same as those that would result from transactions among wholly unrelated parties. The principal related party transactions for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 are as follows: During the second quarter of 2004, the Company advanced approximately RMB1.7 million on an interest free basis to the Companys chief executive officer. The advance was repaid in August 2004. During the second quarter of 2004, the Companys Board of Directors approved the Companys making a one-time payment of the individual income tax obligations of the Companys then chief executive officer and four other senior officers, totaling RMB4.5million.The amounts were recorded as compensation cost and included in service development expenses and general and administrative expenses. In August 2004, in connection with the issuance and sale of 11,188,570 Series B preferred shares for US$58.7 million, the Company repurchased 1,581,874 Series A preferred shares and 4,012,411 ordinary shares from certain shareholders. The repurchases included the purchase of 394,314 ordinary shares, for an aggregate of US$2.1 million, from a company controlled by the Companys then chief executive officer, and 2,877,041 ordinary shares, for an aggregate of US$15.1 million, from a company controlled by a former member of the Companys Board of Directors. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005, the Company paid Expedia Asia Pacific RMB 698,240 and RMB 729,246, respectively, as indemnification for certain obligations under the Series B preferred shares purchase agreement. In addition, as of December 31, 2004, the Company accrued RMB 44,240 relating to these indemnification obligations. In December 2004, the Company received RMB 2,187,850 from two officers of the Company for the payment of the exercise of stock options by such officers. As of December 31, 2004, the exercise of the stock options and related issuance of the ordinary shares were not completed and therefore the amounts received were recorded as amounts due to these two officers. The options were exercised by the officers and the underlying shares were issued by the Company in 2005. In January 2005, in connection with the issuance and sale of 17,362,134 high-vote ordinary shares for US$107.8 million, the Company repurchased 8,681,067 ordinary shares from certain shareholders for an aggregate of US$53,909,426 (US$6.21 per share). The repurchases included the purchase of 4,293,156 ordinary shares, for an aggregate of US$26,636,199 (after taking into consideration the adjustment in the repurchase price) from a company controlled by a former member of the Companys Board of Directors, and 40,506 ordinary shares, for an aggregate of US$251,313 (after taking into consideration the adjustment in the repurchase price), from the Companys then chief financial officer. As a result of the adjustment in the warrant exercise price and repurchase price described in note 12, the Company refunded to Expedia Asia Pacific US$98,270 and certain of the Companys existing shareholders refunded to the Company US$49,134. The Company accrued the amount due to Expedia Asia Pacific and recorded a receivable from the selling shareholders as of December 31, 2005 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. In April 2006, the Company received RMB 26,693,515 of final escrow release on behalf of former selling shareholders in relation with the sale of shares held by Billable Development, Mr. Wang Gui Ying and Mr. Wang Yi Jie to Expedia Asia Pacific, which is controlled by Expedia, Inc, in 2004. As of December 31, 2006, the amount has not been paid to these former shareholders. As a result of sales of their shares, these former shareholders were no longer related to the Company. In April 2006, the Company entered into a contract with Expedia, Inc. The Company provides the international hotel booking service through Expedias hotel inventory. RMB3,056,410 were charged by Expedia in 2006. At the end of 2006, the balance due to Expedia, Inc. was RMB964,562. In August 2006, the Company entered into a contract with Travelscape LLC, which is ultimately controlled by Expedia Inc. The Company provides Chinese hotel inventory procuring, rating and availability negotiating service to Travelscape LLC. RMB3,185,106 of revenue has been recognized in 2006.

The Sellers own or have all rights to use all Intellectual Property in the manner used by the Sellers in the operation of the eDodo Business as of the Closing Date, and such usage does not infringe on any intellectual property rights of any other party and neither Seller has received written notice of a conflict with the asserted rights of others in connection with such Sellers use of any of the Intellectual Property that has not been satisfied or withdrawn.

This Agreement and the legal relations among the parties hereto shall be governed and construed in accordance with the substantive Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws thereof. Section 11.10 Dispute Resolution. In the event of any disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof (collectively, Disputes) the parties shall use their good faith efforts to resolve the same by negotiations between executives of each party hereto (Senior Representatives) who are at a higher level of management than the persons who have direct responsibility for the administration of the matters contemplated by this Agreement. Any party may serve a notice on the other requesting a meeting of Senior Representatives of the parties to meet to resolve any Dispute. The Senior Representatives shall meet within 30 days of delivery of such request at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter as often as they deem necessary, to attempt to resolve the Dispute. The parties shall cooperate in good faith with respect to any reasonable requests for exchanges of information regarding the Dispute. If no resolution can be reached through such efforts within 30 days from the date on which one party first notifies the other party in writing of the existence of a Dispute, then the Dispute shall be submitted to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre for arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Any such arbitration shall be administered by HKIAC in accordance with HKIAC Procedures for Arbitration in force at the date of this Agreement including such additions to the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as are therein contained. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties, and the parties agree to be bound thereby and to act accordingly. The costs of arbitration and the costs of enforcing the arbitration award (including in each case witness expenses and reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) shall be borne by equally by the parties, unless otherwise determined by the arbitration award. In any arbitration proceeding, any legal proceeding to enforce any arbitration award and in any legal action between the parties pursuant to or relating to this Agreement, each party expressly waives any defense based on the fact or allegation that it is an agency or instrumentality of a sovereign state. When any Dispute occurs and when any Dispute is under arbitration or any other proceedings, the parties shall continue to exercise their respective rights, and fulfill their obligations under this Agreement. Section 11.10 Severability. If any provisions hereof shall be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, such provisions shall be of no force and effect, but the illegality or unenforceability shall have no effect upon, and shall not impair the enforceability of, any other provision of this Agreement. 27 Section 11.11 Knowledge. Whenever to its knowledge, known or a similar phrase is used to qualify a representation of the Offshore Party or the Sellers, the knowledge so referred to shall be deemed to be the actual, conscious knowledge of the persons identified on Schedule 11.11 and (b) the knowledge that such persons would reasonably obtain in the discharge of their employment duties to the Sellers; provided, however, that with respect to Hal Fiske, the parties acknowledge that Mr. Fiske has had both legal and non-legal responsibilities within the Sellers and its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and accordingly such knowledge of Mr. Fiske shall not include knowledge of any information to the extent received in the exercise of his responsibilities and duties as in-house counsel to the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, and the inclusion of Mr. Fiske in the aforementioned knowledge group shall not be a waiver of any privilege or confidential communications between Mr. Fiske and the Sellers or their respective Affiliates arising from the attorney-client relationship. Section 11.12 Rights of Third Parties. Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or will be construed to confer upon or give any person or entity other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Section 11.13 Indemnification: Survival of Representations and Warranties. A. Indemnification by Sellers. (i) Each of the Sellers and the Offshore Party hereby jointly and severally agree to defend, hold harmless and indemnify the Purchasers, their respective Affiliates and their respective employees, officers, directors, stockholders, partners and representatives (the Purchaser Indemnified Parties) from and against any losses, assessments, Liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) (Losses) which arise out of or relate to: (1) any breach of any of the representations and warranties of the Offshore Party and the Sellers or their respective Affiliates contained in this Agreement; (2) any breach or non-performance of any covenants or agreements of the Offshore Party and the Sellers or their respective Affiliates contained in this Agreement; (3) any Excluded Non-Compliance Liabilities and (4) Excluded IP Liabilities (all such Losses collectively the Purchasers Losses); provided, however, that the Offshore Party and the Sellers shall not have any obligation so to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties on account of any breach of any representation or warranty pursuant to Section 11.13(A)(i)(1) and/or on account of any Excluded Non-Compliance Liabilities pursuant to Section 11.13(A)(3) unless and until the Purchasers Losses paid, incurred, suffered or accrued by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties on account of all such breaches of representations and warranties and/or indemnification exceed US$150,000 in the aggregate (the Threshold Amount), in which event the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will be entitled to such indemnification only in respect of those Purchasers Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Threshold Amount shall apply to any breach of the representations of the Offshore Party and the Sellers contained in Sections 5.1(A), 5.1(F)(i) and 5.1(M) or to a claim for indemnification hereunder to the extent a breach results from fraud on the part of the Offshore Party or the Sellers. 28 For purposes of this Agreement, (i) Excluded Non-Compliance Liabilities means any liabilities which result from the failure of any Seller or the Offshore Party to comply with applicable Laws in the operation of the eDodo Business prior to the Closing; and (ii) Excluded IP Liabilities means any liabilities which result from the unlawful or illegal misuse or infringement, in the operation of the eDodo Business, of or upon the intellectual property rights of any third party prior to the Closing. B. Indemnification by the Purchaser. Each of the Purchasers hereby agrees to defend, hold harmless and indemnify the Offshore Party, the Sellers, their respective Affiliates and their respective employees, officers, directors, stockholders, partners and representatives (the Seller Indemnified Parties) from and against any Losses which arise out of or relate to: (1) any breach of any of the representations and warranties of the Purchasers or their Affiliates contained in this Agreement or in any other Closing Document; (2) any breach or non-performance of any covenants or agreements of the Purchasers or their respective Affiliates contained in this Agreement ; or (3) the Purchasers failure to perform, pay or discharge in accordance with their respective terms, the Assumed Liabilities (all such Losses collectively, the Sellers Losses). C. Survival of Representations and Warranties. The parties representations and warranties under this Agreement, and the indemnification obligations of the Sellers pursuant to Section 11.13(A)(3), shall survive the Closing and shall expire and terminate on the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing Date (the Survival Date), unless written notice by a Purchaser or the Sellers (or the Offshore Party), as the case may be, of a breach or alleged breach thereof has been provided to the Sellers (or the Offshore Party) or the Purchasers, as the case may be, on or prior to such date, in which case such representations and warranties, and such indemnification obligations, shall not so expire and terminate; provided however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary herein, the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.1(A), 5.1(F)(i) and 5.1(K) of this Agreement and any and all indemnification obligations relating thereto, shall not so expire or otherwise terminate on the Survival Date, but shall instead expire on the date which is ninety (90) calendar days following the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations relating to any claim giving rise to the Purchasers Losses. In the case of actual fraud with respect to any representation or warranty made by a party hereto, such representations and warranties shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. D. Limitations on Indemnification Liability in Certain Cases. (i) The maximum aggregate liability of the Offshore Party and/or the Sellers under Section 11.13(A)(1) for any one or more breaches of the Offshore Partys and the Sellers representations or warranties under Article V of this Agreement and/or under 11.13(A)(3) shall be US$3,650,000 million(the Cap); provided, however, that the Cap shall not apply to any breach of the representations of the Offshore Party and the Sellers contained in Section 5.1(F)(i). 29 (ii) With respect to any matter for which indemnification has been provided hereunder, the Indemnitee hereby covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to collect amounts payable to the Indemnitee under any applicable insurance policy of the Indemnitee, except to the extent any such efforts will result in increased premiums, or adverse change in coverage, under such insurance policies. The amount of any Purchasers Losses or Sellers Losses shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds which relate to the claims or matters giving rise to the same and which proceeds are actually received by the indemnified party within six (6) months of when such losses are incurred. (iii) In no event shall any Purchaser Indemnified Party have any right of indemnity with respect to any breach of a representation or warranty which was known to the Purchasers at Closing; provided, that for purposes of this clause (iii), such knowledge of the Purchasers shall be deemed only to include the actual and conscious (and not constructive) knowledge of the foregoing persons on behalf of the purchasers: Gregg Winiarski, Daniel Fox and Jane Thompson; provided, however, that with respect to Gregg Winiarski, the parties acknowledge that Mr. Winiarski has had both legal and non-legal responsibilities within the Purchasers and its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and accordingly such knowledge of Mr. Winiarski shall not include knowledge of any information to the extent received in the exercise of his responsibilities and duties as in-house counsel to the Purchasers and their Affiliates, and the inclusion of Mr. Winiarski in the aforementioned knowledge group shall not be a waiver of any privilege or confidential communications between Mr. Winiarski and the Purchasers or their Affiliates arising from the attorney-client relationship (iv) In no event shall Sellers Losses or Purchasers Losses, as the case may be, include amounts arising from exemplary or punitive, excluding such damages required to be paid by an Indemnitee to a third party (excluding the Purchasers or the Sellers) on account of a judgment for the same in favor of such third party where such damages would have otherwise constituted Sellers Losses or Purchasers Losses but for this clause (iv). (iv) The parties acknowledge that the limitations set forth in the preceding clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, are not mutually exclusive but are separate and independent limitations, and that each and all such limitations may, alone or together, apply to a partys indemnification obligations in accordance with their respective terms. The limitations set forth in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above shall not apply to any claims for indemnification related to fraud by a party. 30 (v) Each partys sole and exclusive remedy against the other party for any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation made in or imposed by this Agreement, shall be a claim for indemnification under this Section 11.13, subject to the limitations of this Section 11.13; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be construed as limiting in any way (i) the right of a party to seek injunctive relief in accordance with Section 7.6(C); or (ii) any partys recourse in the event of fraud by the other. E. Fraud. For purposes of Section 11.13, the term fraud when used with respect to the Offshore Party and the Sellers shall include, without limitation, any breach by the Offshore Party or the Sellers of any of their representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement if such breach constituted an intentional or knowing misrepresentation and breach by the Company; provided, that neither the existence or knowledge of any facts which give rise to a breach of any such covenant, representation or warranty shall, in and of itself, constitute fraud or an intentional misrepresentation and breach. Notwithstanding Section 11.11, the knowledge referred to in connection with an intentional or knowing breach as set forth above shall be limited to the actual, conscious (and not constructive) knowledge of such breach as of the date hereof by Mike Doyle, Hal Fiske or Derek Palaschuk. F. Procedures for Third Party Claims. (i) In the event that any Legal Proceeding shall be threatened or instituted in respect to which indemnification may be sought by one party hereto from another party under the provisions of this Section 11.13, the party seeking indemnification (Indemnitee) shall, promptly after acquiring actual knowledge of such threatened or instituted Legal Proceeding, cause written notice in reasonable detail of such threatened or instituted Legal Proceeding and which is covered by this indemnification, to be forwarded to the other party from which indemnification is being sought (Indemnitor), provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice as of any particular date as aforesaid will not affect any rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent, and only to such extent, that such failure to provide such notice actually prejudices the Indemnitors ability to adequately defend such Legal Proceeding. (ii) In the event of the initiation of any Legal Proceeding against an Indemnitee by a third party, the Indemnitor shall have the absolute right after the receipt of the notice described in Section 11.13(F)(i), at its option and at its own expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, and (subject to Section 11.13(F)(iii)) to conduct and control the defense of, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any such Legal Proceeding or demand that relates to any Purchasers Losses or Sellers Losses, as the case may be, indemnified against hereunder, and, in such event, the Indemnitee will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor and its representatives in connection with such defense, negotiation, settlement or dealings (and the Indemnitees costs and expenses arising therefrom or relating thereto shall constitute Purchasers Losses, if the Indemnitee is the Purchaser, or Sellers Losses, if the Indemnitee is the Seller); provided, however, that the Indemnitee may directly participate in any such Legal Proceeding so defended with counsel of its choice at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnitor fails to provide a written acknowledgment to the Indemnitee within 15 business days after receiving written notice from the Indemnitee therefor (an Indemnification Acknowledgment Notice) that the Indemnitor will undertake to conduct and control the defense of such claim (which acknowledgement may be made under a reservation of rights), then the Indemnitee may assume its own defense, and, in such event (a) the Indemnitor will be liable for all Purchasers or Sellers Losses, as the case may be, reasonably paid or incurred in connection therewith, and (b) the Indemnitor shall, in any case, reasonably cooperate, at its own expense, with the Indemnitee and its representatives in connection with such defense. 31 (iii) Without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Indemnitor will not enter into any settlement of any third party claim which (x) would lead to Liability or create any financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnitee for which the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder or which does not include an unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all liability with respect to such claim, or (y) which would otherwise adversely affect the eDodo Assets or the eDodo Business. If a firm offer is made to settle a third party claim without leading to Liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnitee for which the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder and the Indemnitor desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnitor will give written notice to the Indemnitee to that effect. If the Indemnitee notifies the Indemnitor that it does not consent to such firm offer within 10 calendar days after its receipt of such notice from the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee may continue to contest or defend such third party claim and, in such event, the maximum Liability of the Indemnitor as to such third party claim will not exceed the amount of such settlement offer, plus the Purchasers Losses or Sellers Losses, as the case may be, reasonably paid or incurred by the Indemnitee through the end of such 10-calendar day period. (iv) After any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction with respect to a third party claim and the time in which to appeal therefrom has expired, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to each separate matter alleged to be indemnified by the Indemnitor hereunder, the Indemnitee shall forward to the Indemnitor notice of any sums due and owing by it with respect to such matter, and the Indemnitor shall pay all of the sums so owing to the Indemnitee by wire transfer or certified or bank cashiers check within 30 days after the date of such notice. Any and all Purchasers Losses or Sellers Losses, other than those described in the preceding sentence (including Purchasers Losses or Sellers Losses incurred in the absence of any threatened or pending Legal Proceeding, or Purchasers Losses or Sellers Losses incurred after any such Legal Proceeding has been threatened or instituted but prior to the rendering of any final judgment or award in connection therewith), shall be paid by the Indemnitor on a current basis, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Indemnitee shall have the right to invoice the Indemnitor for such Purchasers Losses or Sellers Losses, as the case may be, as frequently as it deems appropriate, and the amount of any such Purchasers Losses or Sellers Losses, as the case may be, which are described or listed in any such invoice shall be paid to the Indemnitee, by wire transfer or certified or bank cashiers check, within 30 days after the date of such invoice. 32 Section 11.14 Termination. A. Termination Rights. This Agreement may, by notice given prior to or at the Closing, be terminated: (1) by mutual consent of the Chinese Purchaser and the WFOE Seller; (2) by either the Chinese Purchaser or the WFOE Seller, if there shall be enacted any law that makes consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or if any judgment, injunction, order or decree of a court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall restrain or prohibit the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and such judgment, injunction, order or decree shall become final and nonappealable; (3) by the Chinese Purchaser, if there has been (i)(A) a material breach by a Seller or the Offshore Party of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement that is not qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect, or if any such representation or warranty shall become untrue in any material respect following execution of this Agreement or (B) a breach by a Seller or the Offshore Party of any other representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement, or if any such representation or warranty shall become untrue following execution of this Agreement, or (ii) a material breach by a Seller or the Offshore Party of any of their respective covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement and, in the case of (i) and (ii) above, as the case may be, such Seller or the Offshore Party has not cured such breach (if susceptible to cure) within 15 days after notice by the Purchasers thereof; (4) by the WFOE Seller, if there has been a material breach by a Purchaser of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement and the Purchasers have not cured such breach (if susceptible to cure) in all material respects within 15 days after notice by the Sellers thereof; or (5) by either the Chinese Purchaser or the WFOE Seller, if the Closing has not occurred (other than through the failure of any party seeking to terminate this Agreement to comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement) on or before November 15, 2006 or such later date as the parties may agree upon. B. Notice of Termination; Return or Destruction of Confidential Information. In the event of termination by the WFOE Seller or the Chinese Purchaser pursuant to Section 11.14(A), written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other parties in accordance with Section 11.8, and, subject to compliance with Section 11.14(C), this Agreement shall be terminated without further action by any party. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as provided herein, the Purchasers shall return to the Sellers or destroy all documents and other materials received from the Sellers, the Offshore Party and their respective Affiliates, representatives and agents relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after the execution hereof, along with all copies of such documents and other materials; and the Purchasers shall destroy all materials developed by the Purchasers or any of their Affiliates, representatives or agents from any such documents or other materials. 33 C. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.14(A), all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate, except that the obligations of the parties contained in this Article XI (other than Section 11.13) will survive notwithstanding such termination; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 11.14(C) shall be deemed to adversely affect any terminating partys right to pursue all legal remedies available to such party or to release any party from any liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination, which remedies and liability shall survive such termination. Section 11.15 Public Announcement. No party shall make any public announcement of the execution of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other parties hereto; provided, that the parties may disclose the transaction (without reference to the edodo name prior to the Match Licenseco Qualification Date) in periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities or as otherwise required by law, and may disclose only to the extent necessary transaction information in response to questions raised by investors following availability of public reports set out above.

Unless the context otherwise requires, (i) each accounting term not otherwise defined in this Agreement has the meaning assigned to it in accordance with GAAP, (ii) or is disjunctive but not necessarily exclusive, (iii) all references to $ or dollar amounts mean lawful currency of the United States of America.; and (iv) Agreement means this Asset Purchase Agreement, including all schedules and exhibits hereto. B. Interpretive Matters.

References to the Purchasers mean each Purchaser and both Purchasers, individually and collectively; references to the Sellers mean each Seller and both Sellers, individually and collectively. 34 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.
