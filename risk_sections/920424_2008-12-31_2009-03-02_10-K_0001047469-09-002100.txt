Item 1A. Risk Factors Certain Factors That May Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations While our management's long term expectations are optimistic, we face risks or uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. The following conditions, among others, should be considered in evaluating our business and growth outlook. Decreases in trading volumes or securities prices could harm our business and profitability. Declines in the volume of securities traded would generally result in lower revenues from our commission-based products and services, which generate the vast majority of our revenues globally. In addition, securities' price declines would adversely affect our non-North American trading commissions, which are based on the value of transactions. The demand for our trade execution services is directly affected by factors such as economic, regulatory and political conditions that may lead to decreased trading activity and prices in the securities markets in the U.S. and in all of the foreign markets we serve. Over the past several years, trading volumes have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so. This past year also saw a considerable decrease in securities prices and market declines, which materially impacted our non-North American revenues. Market declines may continue. Our results of operations could be materially impacted by decreases in trading revenues because a significant portion of our costs are fixed based on historical and anticipated demand for our services, and may not be able to be adjusted in a timely manner, if at all. Decreases in our commission rates and other transactional fees could adversely affect our operating results. For the last several years, the institutional equities markets have experienced continued pricing pressure on commission rates. We anticipate a continuation of the competitive commission pricing environment for the foreseeable future. A significant decrease in commission rates or other transactional fees could materially harm our financial condition and operating results. A failure in the design or operation of our technology could adversely affect our profitability and reputation. A technological failure or error of one or more of our products or systems, including but not limited to POSIT, our algorithms, smart routers, and order and execution management systems, could result in lost revenues and/or significant market losses. We operate complex trading systems, analytical products and algorithms that may fail to correctly model interacting or conflicting trading objectives, unusual market conditions, available trading venues and other factors, causing unintended results. Similarly, the operation of our systems can be quite complex and departure from standard procedures can result in adverse trading outcomes. Such problems could cause us to incur trading losses, lose clients or experience other reputational harm resulting in lost revenues and profits. While we put all of 15 Table of Contents our products through rigorous quality assurance testing, we cannot test for all potential scenarios or ensure that the technology will function as designed and intended in all cases. If we fail to keep up with rapid changes in technology and continue to provide leading products and services to our customers, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. The institutional brokerage industry is subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. Our customers' demands become greater and more sophisticated as the dissemination of information to customers increases. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services, products and technologies, innovate in a timely and cost-effective manner and adapt to technological advancements and changing standards, we may be unable to compete effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, the development of technology-based services is a complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new product releases, failure to meet key deadlines or significant problems in creating new products could negatively impact our revenues and profits. Insufficient system capacity, system operating failures or security breaches could materially harm our reputation, financial position and profitability. Our business relies heavily on the computer and communications systems supporting our operations, which must monitor, process and support a large volume of transactions across numerous execution venues in many countries and multiple currencies. As our business expands, we will need to expand our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions across a larger client base and more geographical locations. Unexpectedly high volumes or times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly, decrease output or even fail for periods of time, as could general power or telecommunications failures, natural disasters or other business disruptions. The presence of computer viruses can also cause failure of our systems. If any of our systems do not operate properly, are disabled or breached, we could incur financial loss, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. System failure, degradation or breach could adversely affect our ability to effectuate transactions and lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations, initiate regulatory inquiries or proceedings, file lawsuits against us, trade less frequently through us or cease doing business with us. Our corporate headquarters and largest concentration of employees and technology is in the New York metropolitan area. Our other offices are also located in major cities around the globe. If a business system disruption were to occur, especially in New York, for any reason including natural disasters or terrorist activities, and we were unable to execute our contingency plans, it could have a material effect on our business. Moreover, we have varying levels of contingency plan coverage among our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Our business relies on the secure storage, processing and transmission of data, including our clients' confidential data, in our internal systems and through our vendor networks and communications infrastructure. Third parties who are able to breach our or our vendors' security systems may be able to cause system damage or failures or perform unauthorized trading that could result in significant losses. Although we take significant precautions and implement protective measures, which are updated and monitored regularly, there is no guarantee that our systems can prevent all unauthorized access or that our third party vendors will be able to secure their networks and systems. If our or one of our vendors' security is breached and unauthorized access is obtained to the confidential information of our clients, it could cause us reputational harm and our clients may reduce use of or cease using our services, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Any system, operational or security failure or breach could result in regulatory or legal claims. We could incur significant costs in defending such regulatory or legal claims, even those without merit. 16 Table of Contents Moreover, such failures could result in the need to remediate issues and repair or expand our networks and systems. Any obligation to expend significant resources to defend claims or repair and expand infrastructure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our securities and clearing business exposes us to material liquidity risk. We are self-clearing in the U.S., Hong Kong and Australia. In those markets, we may be required to provide considerable additional capital to regulatory agencies or increase deposits with clearing and settlement organizations, such as the National Securities Clearing Corporation or Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation in the U.S., especially during periods of high market volatility. We have relied on our excess cash and certain established banking relationships to meet those demands. While we have historically met requests for additional capital, there is no guarantee that any of our liquidity providers will meet those needs if called upon in the future. Given the current market conditions, where limited financing is available and the cost of financing has increased, there is no guarantee our lenders would be willing or able to provide the additional capital requested. In addition, each of our broker-dealer subsidiaries worldwide is subject to regulatory capital requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate. The failure by any of these subsidiaries to maintain its required regulatory capital may lead to suspension or revocation of its broker-dealer registration and its suspension or expulsion by its regulatory body. Historically, all regulatory capital needs of our broker-dealers have been provided by cash from operations. While we believe that our current cash balances and cash flows from operations will continue to provide our broker-dealers with sufficient regulatory capital, we have $40 million in credit facilities that can be accessed to supplement our existing regulatory capital, as needed. However, if those amounts are not sufficient, we cannot be assured that we would be able to obtain additional financing given current market conditions, including the tightening of financing by lenders. Our business exposes us to credit risk that could affect our operating results and profitability. We are exposed to credit risk from third parties that owe us money, securities or other obligations, including our customers and trading counterparties. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In addition, client trading errors for which they are unable to cover may cause us to incur financial losses. Volatile securities markets, credit markets and regulatory changes increase our exposure to our customers' credit profiles, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. The downturn in the global securities and credit markets in the second half of 2008 increased our exposure to credit risk. While our broker-dealer subsidiaries that are not self-clearing have clearing agreements with their clearing brokers who are responsible for reviewing the credit risk of trading counterparties, we have no assurances that those reviews or our own are adequate to provide sufficient protection from this risk. As a clearing member firm in certain jurisdictions we are subject to significant default risk. The Company is required to finance our clients' unsettled positions from time to time and we could be held responsible for the defaults of our clients. In Europe, default by our clients may also give rise to our incurring penalties imposed by execution venues and settlement systems. Although we regularly review credit exposure, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that may be difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions that could in turn adversely affect ITG. 17 Table of Contents Our operations in jurisdictions other than the U.S., Hong Kong and Australia are dependent on their clearing agents and any failures by them could materially impact our business and operating results. These operations are dependent on our network of agents for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. If our agents fail to properly facilitate the clearance and settlement of our customer trades, we could be subject to financial, legal and regulatory risks and costs that may impact our business and operating results. In addition, it could cause our clients to reduce or cease their trading with us, which would adversely affect our revenues and financial results. Moreover, certain of our agreements with clearing agents may be terminated upon short notice. There is no guarantee that we could obtain alternative services in a timely manner and any interruption of the normal course of our trading and clearing operations could have a material impact on our business and results of operations. We incur principal trading risk in our Canadian interlisted arbitrage trading business. A portion of our Canadian revenues is derived from U.S.- Canada interlisted arbitrage trading in which ITG Canada acts as principal. As a result of this trading, we may incur losses relating to the purchase or sale of interlisted securities for our own account. Although we attempt to close out all of our arbitrage positions immediately, if for any reason we are unable to do so, we bear the risk of market fluctuations and may incur losses due to changes in the prices of such securities. The business in which we operate is extremely competitive worldwide. The financial services industry generally, and the institutional securities brokerage business in which we operate, are extremely competitive, and we expect them to remain so for the foreseeable future. Our extensive suite of products does not directly compete with a particular firm; however, individual products compete with various firms and consortia: Our pre- and post-trade analytic products compete with several sell side-affiliated and independent companies. Our POSIT suite competes with various national and regional securities exchanges, ATSs, ECNs, MTFs, and systematic internalizers (firms which make markets outside an EU exchange or a MTF) for trade execution services. These destinations have proliferated in recent years. These include traditional ATSs, as well as sell side consortiums and exchange-sponsored crossing systems. Our execution management systems, order management system and algorithmic trading products compete with offerings from independent vendors, agency only firms and sell side firms. Our full range of portfolio, single-stock, international and hedge fund trading services compete with trading desks at large sell side firms. Our ITG Net business competes with managed network providers, which include certain order management system providers as well as firms offering stand-alone managed network services. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, which, among other things, enable them to compete with the services we provide on the basis of price, including lowering prices for certain of our key services to gain business in their higher margin areas, and a willingness to commit their firms' capital to service a client's trading needs on a principal, rather than on an agency basis. Many of them offer a wider range of services, have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do. Some of our competitors have long-standing, well-established relationships with their clients, and also hold dominant positions in their trading markets. Moreover, new entrants may enter the market with alternative methods of providing trade and execution services and existing competitors often launch new initiatives, most recently developing and connecting their own internal liquidity pools. 18 Table of Contents In addition, we face competition for our subscription based services, such as our order management system and post-trade services, from other financial services firms and independent software vendors, and for our network connectivity services from other stand-alone network providers and order management system providers. The barriers to entry for some of these services are low and new entrants have recently entered the market. If our competitors' products, pricing or service levels are perceived to be superior or clients are required by another order management system to use their network, we may lose material subscription revenues. Although we believe that our products and services have established certain competitive advantages, our ability to maintain these advantages will require continued enhancements to our products, investment in the development of our services, additional marketing activities and enhanced customer support services. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make this investment, that our competitors will not devote significantly more resources to competing services or that we will otherwise be successful in maintaining our market position. If competitors offering superior services affected our market share, this would adversely impact our business and results of operations. We face certain challenges and risks to the growth of our non-U.S. business that may adversely affect our business strategy. Global expansion is a key component of our business plan. We have invested significant resources in our foreign operations and the globalization of our products and services. However, there are certain risks inherent in the expansion of our business outside the U.S., including but not limited to, less developed technology and infrastructure and higher costs for infrastructure. These risks may limit our ability to provide services to clients in certain markets. There also may be difficult and lengthy processes for obtaining regulatory approvals. This could result in delays in our business plans, difficulties in staffing foreign operations and adapting our products to foreign markets, practices and languages, exchange rate risks and the need to meet foreign regulatory requirements. Each of these could force us to alter expansion plans or timelines and this may adversely impact our growth strategy. We are dependent on certain major customers and a decline in their use of our services could materially impact our revenues. Our customers may discontinue their use of our trading services at any time. The loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The chart below sets forth our dependence on our three largest clients individually, as well as on our ten largest clients in the aggregate, expressed as a percentage of total revenues: % of Total Consolidated Revenue 2008 2007 2006 Largest customer 4.2 % 6.1 % 3.2 % Second largest customer 2.2 % 3.6 % 2.0 % Third largest customer 2.1 % 2.3 % 1.9 % Ten largest customers 19.2 % 24.5 % 16.9 % The securities markets and the brokerage industry in which we operate globally are subject to extensive, evolving regulation that could materially impact our business. We face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business, such as the SEC and the FINRA in the U.S. and their equivalents in other countries. In addition, we currently operate both POSIT Match and POSIT Now in the U.S. under Regulation ATS, our European operations are subject to the recently implemented MiFID and we must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Patriot Act and its foreign equivalents for monitoring our customers 19 Table of Contents and suspicious transactions. Moreover, most aspects of our broker-dealer operations are highly regulated, such as sales and reporting practices, operational compliance, capital requirements and licensure of employees. As we expand our business we will be exposed to increased and different types of regulatory requirements. In the future, we may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, which may adversely affect our business. Also, regulatory changes that impact how our customers conduct their business may impact our business and results of operations. The new U.S. administration and other governments have indicated that they are considering new regulatory requirements for the financial services industry. We cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes can affect our business. Our fixed costs for technology and infrastructure may result in reduced profitability or losses. We incur significant operating and capital expenditures to support our business that do not vary directly, at least in the short term, with fluctuations in securities transaction volumes and revenues. To ensure that we have the capacity to process projected increases in transaction volumes, we have historically made substantial capital, operating and research expenditures in advance of such projected increases, including during periods of low transaction volumes. In the event of a material reduction in trading volumes and/or revenues, we may not be able to reduce such expenses quickly and, as a result, we could experience reduced profitability or losses. In the event that growth in transaction volumes does not occur or we are not able to successfully implement and monetize our capital and research projects, including by failing to accurately forecast the demand for new products, the expenses related to such investments could cause reduced profitability or losses. We are dependent on certain third party vendors for key services. We depend on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading systems, computers, market data, data centers, FIX connectivity, communication network infrastructure, other equipment and related support and maintenance. We cannot be certain that any of these providers will be willing and able to continue to provide these services in an efficient and cost-effective manner or that they will be willing or able to meet our expanding needs. Moreover, we are increasingly dependent on our communications network providers for interconnectivity with our clients, markets and clearing agents to service our customers and operate effectively. Given current market conditions, there is also increased risk that one or more of our vendors may file for bankruptcy or otherwise be unable to meet its obligations. If our vendors fail to meet their obligations, provide poor, inaccurate or untimely service, or we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of these services, we may fail, in turn, to meet our obligations to our customers and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed. We incur risks related to our international business due to currency exchange rate fluctuations that could impact our financial results and financial position. As we continue to grow our non-U.S. operations, an increasing amount of our business is conducted in foreign currencies. Conducting business in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar subjects us to exchange rate fluctuations. These fluctuations can materially impact our financial results. We could be subject to challenges by U.S. and foreign tax authorities that could result in additional taxes and penalties. We are subject to income and other taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We are also subject to reviews and audits by U.S. and foreign tax authorities. Our determination of our tax obligations in each jurisdiction requires us and our advisers to make judgment calls and estimations. Our determination may differ, even materially, from the judgment of the tax authorities and therefore cause us to incur additional taxes and related interest and penalties, which could impact our financial results. 20 Table of Contents Inability to protect our intellectual property may result in increased competition, loss of business or other negative results on our business and financial condition. Our success is dependent, in part, upon our proprietary intellectual property. We generally rely upon patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect our rights in our proprietary technology, methods, products and services. We cannot assure that any of the rights granted under any patent, copyright or trademark that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages. A third party may still try to challenge, invalidate or circumvent the protective mechanisms that we select. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., so we cannot predict our ability to properly protect our intellectual property in those jurisdictions. Third parties operating in jurisdictions in which we have not filed for protection may obtain rights in intellectual property that we have protected in the U.S. and other jurisdictions or may be able to misappropriate our intellectual property with impunity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property from improper disclosure or use, or that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology without violating our intellectual property. Violations of our intellectual property by third parties could have an adverse effect on our competitiveness and business. In addition, the cost of seeking to enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial results. If we were to unknowingly infringe third party intellectual property or be accused of doing so without merit, we would bear significant costs of defense and litigation, which could impact our financial results. In the past several years, there has been a proliferation of patents applicable to the computer and financial services industries. Under current law, U.S. patent applications remain secret for 18 months and may, depending upon where else such applications are filed, remain secret until the issuance of a patent. In light of these factors, it is not always possible to determine in advance whether any of our products or services may infringe the present or future patent rights of others. From time to time, we may receive notices from others of claims or potential claims of intellectual property infringement or we may be called upon to defend our product, customer, vendee or licensee against such third party claims. Responding to these kinds of claims, regardless of merit, could consume valuable time and result in costly litigation that could have a material adverse effect on us. Such claims could also result in our entering into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement on terms that could have a material impact on our profitability. Financial and operational problems with our acquisitions and strategic relationships could have a material impact on our results of operation. Over the last several years, we have undertaken several strategic acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Macgregor, Plexus and RedSky Financial, LLC ("RedSky"), as well as various strategic relationships. We intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and strategic relationships. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including but not limited to difficulties in valuing the acquired businesses, combining personnel and firm cultures, integrating acquired products, services and operations, the assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies and the potential loss of key clients or employees of acquired companies. Strategic relationships may be important to our business prospects and we may not be able to successfully develop or maintain such relationships. If we are unable to successfully complete acquisitions and integrate the acquired businesses, suffer a material loss due to an acquired business or fail to develop or maintain strategic relationships, it may have a material effect on our operating results. 21 Table of Contents Misconduct of our employees could cause us reputational and financial harm. Employee errors in recording or executing transactions for customers can cause us to enter into transactions that customers may disavow and refuse to settle. These transactions expose us to risk of loss, which can be material, until we detect the errors in question and unwind or reverse the transactions. As with any unsettled transaction, adverse movements in the prices of the securities involved in these transactions before we unwind or reverse them can increase this risk. We may incur losses as a result of these transactions that could materially impact our financial results. In addition to trading errors, other employee misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. It is not always possible to prevent employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information. Such misconduct could result in losses, litigation or other material adverse effects on the Company. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None
