Risk Factors regarding additional discussion of environmental matters. Other Policies The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities. One or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote. Investment Policies The Company elected to be treated as a REIT commencing with the taxable year beginning July 1, 2010, its date of incorporation. REIT limitations restrict us from making investments that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75% of our total assets. In addition, at least 75% of our gross income must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including "rents from real property," dividends from other REITs and, in certain circumstances, interest from certain types of temporary investments. At least 95% of our income must be derived from such real property investments, and from dividends, interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing. 3 Table of Contents Subject to REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would normally be in the form of a general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties. We may, in the future, acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies. Financing Policies We do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. We generally seek to finance individual properties on a secured basis. However, mortgage financing instruments usually limit additional indebtedness on those properties. Typically, we invest in or form separate legal entities to assist us in obtaining permanent financing at attractive terms. Permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property, or on a group of properties, and generally requires us to provide a mortgage interest on the property in favor of an institutional third party or as a securitized financing. These legal entities are structured so that they would not necessarily be consolidated in the event we became subject to a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation. We decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives. We include the outstanding securitized debt of legal entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness. We are party to a revolving credit facility that requires us to satisfy certain affirmative and negative covenants and to meet financial ratios and tests, which may include ratios and tests based on leverage, interest coverage and net worth. If our Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise that capital through additional public equity or preferred equity offerings, public debt offerings, debt financing, retention of cash flows, by creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties or a combination of these methods. Our ability to retain cash flow is limited by the requirement for REITs to pay tax on or distribute 100% of their taxable capital gains income and distribute at least 90% of their taxable income. If our Board of Directors determines to raise additional equity capital, it may, without stockholder approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. The Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate. Such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock. Such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock, which may be convertible into common stock. Any such offering could dilute a stockholder's investment in us. Brookfield (as defined in Note 1) has preemptive rights to purchase our common stock as necessary to allow it to maintain its respective proportional ownership interest in GGP on a fully diluted basis. We implemented a dividend reinvestment plan ("DRIP"). We may determine to pay dividends in a combination of cash and shares of common stock. Conflict of Interest Policies We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted governance principles governing our affairs and the Board of Directors, as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of the Board of Directors. In addition, we have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which was updated in 2013, and applies to all of our officers, directors, and employees. At least a majority of the members of our Board of Directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards for NYSE companies. Any 4 Table of Contents transaction between us and any director, officer or 5% stockholder must be approved pursuant to our Related Party Transaction Policy, including such transactions with Brookfield, our largest stockholder. Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities We intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a REIT, unless the Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to qualify as a REIT. We have authority to offer shares of our common stock or other securities in exchange for property. We also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities. We may issue shares of our common stock, or cash at our option, to holders of units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership in future periods upon exercise of such holders' rights under the Operating Partnership agreement. Our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose. We may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate. Bankruptcy and Reorganization In April 2009, GGP, Inc. and certain subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the bankruptcy court of the Southern District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court"). On October 21, 2010, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming GGP, Inc.'s plan of reorganization (the "Plan"). Pursuant to the Plan, prepetition creditor claims were satisfied in full and equity holders received newly issued common stock in GGP and in Howard Hughes Corporation ("HHC"). After that distribution, HHC became a publicly-held company. GGP has no remaining interest in HHC as of the Effective Date (as defined in Note 1). Employees As of January 24, 2014, we had approximately 1,500 employees. Insurance We have comprehensive liability, property and rental loss insurance with respect to our portfolio of properties. We believe that such insurance provides adequate coverage. Qualification as a REIT and Taxability of Distributions The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with the taxable year beginning July 2010, its date of incorporation, and the Company intends to maintain REIT status, and therefore our operations will not be subject to Federal tax on real estate investment trust taxable income. A schedule detailing the taxability of dividends for 2013, 2012 and 2011 has been presented in Note 11. Available Information Our Internet website address is www.ggp.com.

RISK FACTORS Business Risks Regional and local economic conditions may adversely affect our business Our real property investments are influenced by the regional and local economy, which may be negatively impacted by increased unemployment, increased federal income and payroll taxes, increased state and local taxes, increased real estate taxes, industry slowdowns, lack of availability of consumer credit, increased levels of consumer debt, poor housing market conditions, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, plant closings, and other factors. Similarly, local real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, and the supply and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants may negatively impact our properties. Economic conditions, especially in the retail sector, may have an adverse effect on our revenues and available cash Unemployment, increased federal income and payroll taxes, increased state and local real estate taxes, health care costs, weak income growth, limited credit availability, and the need to pay down existing obligations may negatively impact consumer spending. Given these economic conditions, we believe there is a risk that the sales at stores operating in our properties may be adversely affected, which may cause tenants to be unable to pay their rental obligations. Because substantially all of our income is derived from rentals of real property, our income and available cash would be adversely affected if a significant number of tenants are unable to meet their obligations. We may be unable to lease or re-lease space in our properties on favorable terms or at all Our results of operations depend on our ability to continue to lease space in our properties, including vacant space and re-leasing space in properties where leases are expiring, optimizing our tenant mix or leasing properties on economically favorable terms. Because approximately ten to eleven percent of our total leases expire annually, we are continually focused on leasing our properties. Similarly, we are pursuing a strategy of replacing expiring short-term leases with long-term leases. The bankruptcy or store closures of national tenants, which are tenants with chains of stores in many of our properties, may adversely affect our revenues Our leases generally contain provisions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of the tenant. However, companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy, or from time to time, have voluntarily closed certain of their stores. We may be unable to re-lease such space or to re-lease it on comparable or more favorable terms, as such tenants help attract other tenants to the property. As a result, the bankruptcy or closure of a national tenant may adversely affect our revenues. In addition, such closings may allow other tenants to modify their leases to terms that are less favorable for us, also adversely impacting our revenues. Certain co-tenancy provisions in our lease agreements may result in reduced rent payments, which may adversely affect our operations and occupancy Certain of our lease agreements include a co-tenancy provision which allows the tenant to pay a reduced rent amount and, in certain instances, terminate the lease, if we fail to maintain certain occupancy levels. Therefore, if occupancy or tenancy falls below certain thresholds, rents we are entitled to receive from our retail tenants could be reduced. 6 Table of Contents It may be difficult to sell real estate quickly, and transfer restrictions apply to some of our properties Real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which may limit our ability to strategically change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. If revenues from a property declines while the related expenses do not decline, our income and cash available to us would be adversely affected. If it becomes necessary or desirable for us to dispose of one or more of our mortgaged properties, we might not be able to obtain a release of the lien on the mortgaged property without payment of the associated debt. The foreclosure of a mortgage on a property or inability to sell a property could adversely affect the level of cash available to us. Our business is dependent on perceptions by retailers and shoppers of the convenience and attractiveness of our retail properties, and our inability to maintain a positive perception may adversely affect our revenues We are dependent on perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our retail properties. If retailers and shoppers perceive competing retail properties and other retailing options such as the internet to be more convenient or of a higher quality, our revenues may be adversely affected. We develop and expand properties, and this activity is subject to risks due to economic factors Capital investment to expand or develop our properties is anticipated to be an ongoing part of our strategy. In connection with such projects, we will be subject to various risks, which may result in lower than expected returns or a loss. These risks include the following: we may not have sufficient capital to proceed with planned expansion or development activities; construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates; we may not be able to obtain zoning, occupancy or other required governmental permits and authorizations; income at completed projects may not meet projections; and we may not be able to obtain anchor store, mortgage lender and property partner approvals, if applicable, for expansion or development activities. 7 Table of Contents Acquisitions may not be successful Newly acquired properties may not perform as expected, such as not realizing expected occupancy and rental rates. In addition, we may have unexpected costs and may be unable to finance or refinance the new properties at acceptable terms. If an acquisition is not successful, we may have a loss on our investment in the property. We are in a competitive business There are numerous retail formats that compete with our properties in attracting retailers to lease space. In addition, retailers at our properties face continued competition from retailers at other regional malls, lifestyle and power centers, outlet malls and other discount shopping centers, discount shopping clubs, through internet sales, catalog companies, and telemarketing. Competition of these types could adversely affect our revenues and cash flows. We compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment opportunities. These competitors include REITs, investment banking firms and private institutional investors. Our ability to realize our strategies and capitalize on our competitive strengths are dependent on our ability to effectively operate a large portfolio of high quality properties, maintain good relationships with our tenants and consumers, and remain well-capitalized. Our failure to do any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate. Some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters A number of our properties are located in areas which are subject to natural or other disasters, including hurricanes and earthquakes. Furthermore, many of our properties are located in coastal regions, and would therefore be affected by any future increases in sea levels. For example, certain of our properties are located in California and Hawaii or in other areas with a higher risk of natural disasters such as earthquakes or tsunamis. Possible terrorist activity or other acts of violence and threats to public safety could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Terrorist attacks in the United States or other acts of violence may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. Such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties. Terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss, and the availability of insurance for such acts, or of insurance generally, might be reduced or cost more, which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases. These acts might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies. Any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of our new or redeveloped properties, and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital. We may incur costs to comply with environmental laws Under various Federal, state or local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property, and may be held liable to third parties for bodily injury or property damage (investigation and/or clean-up costs) incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release 8 Table of Contents of the hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell, lease or borrow with respect to the real estate. Other Federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of demolition or certain renovations or remodeling, the cost of which may be substantial for certain redevelopments, and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Federal and state laws also regulate the operation and removal of underground storage tanks. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of certain properties, we could be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to these regulated substances or tanks or related claims. Our properties have been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. However, the identification of new areas of contamination, a change in the extent or known scope of contamination or changes in cleanup requirements could result in significant costs to us. Some potential losses are not insured We carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, terrorism, extended coverage and rental loss and environmental insurance on all of our properties. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. There are, however, some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims, and certain environmental conditions not discovered within the applicable policy period, which generally are not insured. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. If this happens, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. Inflation or deflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Should the general price level increase in the future, this may have an impact on our consumers' disposable income. This may place pressure on retailer sales and margins as their costs rise and they may be unable to pass the costs along to the consumer, which in turn may affect their ability to pay rents and which could adversely impact our cash flow. Many but not all of our leases have fixed amounts for recoveries and if our costs rise we may not be able to pass these costs on to our tenants. Rising costs may also impact our ability to generate cash flows. Inflation also poses a risk to us due to the possibility of future increases in interest rates. Such increases would result in higher interest rates on new fixed-rate debt and adversely impact us due to our outstanding variable rate debt. From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to a portion of our variable-rate debt using interest rate cap, swap and treasury lock agreements. Such agreements allow us to replace variable-rate debt with fixed-rate debt. However, our efforts to manage risks associated with interest rate volatility may not be successful. Additionally, interest rate cap, swap and treasury-lock agreements expose us to additional risks, including that the counterparties to the agreements might not perform their obligations. We also might be subject to additional costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs, if we terminate these agreements. Deflation may have an impact on our ability to repay our debt. Deflation may delay consumption and thus weaken tenant sales, which may reduce our tenants' ability to pay rents. Deflationary pressure on retailers may diminish their ability to rent our space and decrease our ability to release the space on favorable terms to us. Organizational Risks We are a holding company with no operations of our own and will depend on our subsidiaries for cash Our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. Our ability to make dividends or distributions in connection with being a REIT is highly dependent on the earnings of and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries through dividends or distributions, and our ability to generate cash to meet our debt service obligations is further limited by our subsidiaries' ability to make such 9 Table of Contents dividends, distributions or intercompany loans. Our subsidiaries' ability to pay any dividends or distributions to us are limited by their obligations to satisfy their own obligations to their creditors and preferred stockholders before making any dividends or distributions to us. Delaware law imposes requirements that could further restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. We share control of some of our properties with other investors and may have conflicts of interest with those investors For the Unconsolidated Properties (as defined in Note 1), we are required to make decisions with the other investors who have interests in the relevant property or properties. For example, the approval of certain of the other investors is required with respect to operating budgets and refinancing, encumbering, expanding or selling any of these properties, to make distributions, as well as to bankruptcy decisions related to the Unconsolidated Properties and related joint ventures. We might not have the same interests as the other investors in relation to these transactions. Accordingly, we might not be able to favorably resolve any of these issues, or we might have to provide financial or other inducements to the other investors to obtain a favorable resolution. In addition, various restrictive provisions and rights apply to sales or transfers of interests in our jointly owned properties. As such, we might be required to make decisions about buying or selling interests in a property or properties at a time that is not desirable. Bankruptcy of our joint venture partners could impose delays and costs on us with respect to the jointly owned retail properties The bankruptcy of one of the other investors in any of our jointly owned shopping malls could materially and adversely affect the relevant property or properties. Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, we would be precluded from taking some actions affecting the estate of the other investor without prior court approval which would, in most cases, entail prior notice to other parties and a hearing. At a minimum, the requirement to obtain court approval may delay the actions we would or might want to take. If the relevant joint venture through which we have invested in a property has incurred recourse obligations, the discharge in bankruptcy of one of the other investors might result in our ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations than would otherwise be required. We are impacted by tax-related obligations to some of our partners We own certain properties through partnerships which have arrangements in place that protect the deferred tax situation of our existing third party limited partners. Violation of these arrangements could impose costs on us. As a result, we may be restricted with respect to decisions such as financing, encumbering, expanding or selling these properties. Several of our joint venture partners are tax-exempt. As such, they are taxable to the extent of their share of unrelated business taxable income generated from these jointly owned properties. As the manager of these joint ventures, we have obligations to avoid the creation of unrelated business taxable income at these properties. As a result, we may be restricted with respect to decisions related to the financing of and revenue generation from these properties. We may not be able to maintain our status as a REIT We have elected to be treated as a REIT in connection with the filing of our tax return for 2010, retroactive to July 1, 2010. It is possible that we may not meet the conditions for continued qualification as a REIT and that the cost of maintaining REIT status might have a material impact on the Company. In addition, once an entity is qualified as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") generally requires that such entity distribute at least 90% of its taxable ordinary income to shareholders and pay tax on or distribute 100% of its taxable capital gains. We expect to distribute 100% of our taxable capital gains and taxable ordinary income to shareholders annually. For 2010, we 10 Table of Contents made 90% of this distribution in common stock and 10% in cash. For 2011, we made this distribution in the form of quarterly $0.10 per share cash payments and the special dividend of the common stock of Rouse Properties, Inc. There can be no assurances as to the allocation between cash and common stock of our future dividends. If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we would not be allowed to deduct distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income and Federal income tax. If any of our REIT subsidiaries fail to qualify as a REIT, such failure could result in our loss of REIT status. If we lose our REIT status, corporate level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, would apply to our taxable income at regular corporate rates. As a result, the amount available for distribution to holders of equity securities that would otherwise receive dividends would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions. In addition, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. We believe that we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity as defined by the Code. However, because our shares are publicly traded, no assurance can be given that the Company is or will continue to be a domestically controlled qualified investment entity. An ownership limit, certain anti-takeover defenses and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain the following limitations. The ownership limit. Generally, for us to qualify as a REIT under the Code for a taxable year, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer "individuals" at any time during the last half of such taxable year. Our charter provides that no one individual may own more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of capital stock unless our board of directors provides a waiver from the ownership restrictions. As of February 18, 2014, Brookfield's potential ownership of the Company (assuming full share settlement of the Warrants), including (i) the effect of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants owned by Brookfield or managed by Brookfield on behalf of third parties and (ii) shares managed by Brookfield on behalf of third parties, is 40.9%, which is stated in their Form 13D filed on the same date. The Code defines "individuals" for purposes of the requirement described above to include some types of entities. However, our certificate of incorporation also permits us to exempt a person from the ownership limit described therein upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which are described in our certificate of incorporation. Selected provisions of our charter documents. Our charter authorizes the board of directors: to cause us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock; to classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred stock; and to set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified stock that we issue. Selected provisions of our bylaws. Our amended and restated bylaws contain the following limitations: the inability of stockholders to act by written consent; restrictions on the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting without 15% or more of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; and rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings. 11 Table of Contents Selected provisions of Delaware law. We are a Delaware corporation, and Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law applies to us. In general, Section 203 prevents an "interested stockholder" (as defined below), from engaging in a "business combination" (as defined in the statute) with us for three years following the date that person becomes an interested stockholder unless one or more of the following occurs: before that person became an interested stockholder, our board of directors approved the transaction in which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder or approved the business combination; upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the interested stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) stock held by directors who are also officers of our company and by employee stock plans that do not provide employees with the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; and following the transaction in which that person became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder. The statute defines "interested stockholder" as any person that is the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or is an affiliate or associate of us and was the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock at any time within the three-year period immediately before the date of determination. Each item discussed above may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company, even if a proposed transaction is at a premium over the then current market price for our common stock. Further, these provisions may apply in instances where some stockholders consider a transaction beneficial to them. As a result, our stock price may be negatively affected by these provisions. There is a risk of investor influence over our company that may be adverse to our best interests and those of our other shareholders Brookfield owns, or manages on behalf of third parties, a significant portion of the shares of our common stock (excluding shares issuable upon the exercise of Warrants) as of December 31, 2013. The effect of the exercise of the Warrants by Brookfield or the election to receive future dividends in the form of common stock, would further increase their ownership. Due to the Warrants, Brookfield's potential ownership amount will continue to change due to payments of dividends and changes in our stock price. Brookfield has entered into standstill agreements to limit their influence, the concentration of ownership of our outstanding equity held or managed by Brookfield may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without their support, or more likely with their support. The interests of Brookfield, any other substantial stockholder or any of their respective affiliates could conflict with or differ from our interests or the interests of the holders of our common stock. For example, the concentration of ownership held or managed by Brookfield could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination that may otherwise be favorable for us and the other stockholders. Brookfield may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. We cannot assure you that the standstill agreements can fully protect against these risks. Brookfield has the right to designate three directors of our Board of Directors as it owns 20% or greater of our outstanding shares as stated under the Investment Agreements (defined in Note 1). As 12 Table of Contents long as Brookfield owns directly or indirectly, a substantial portion of our outstanding shares, subject to the terms of the standstill agreements, it would be able to exert significant influence over us, including: the composition of our board of directors; direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers; the determination of incentive compensation, which may affect our ability to retain key employees; any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations; our acquisition or disposition of assets; our financing decisions and our capital raising activities; the payment of dividends; conduct in regulatory and legal proceedings; and amendments to our certificate of incorporation. Some of our directors are involved in other businesses including, without limitation, real estate activities and public and/or private investments and, therefore, may have competing or conflicting interests with us and our board of directors has adopted resolutions renouncing any interest or expectation in any such business opportunities. In addition, our relationship agreement with Brookfield Asset Management Inc. contains significant exclusions from Brookfield's obligation to present opportunities to us Certain of our directors have and may in the future have interests in other real estate business activities, and may have control or influence over these activities or may serve as investment advisors, directors or officers. These interests and activities, and any duties to third parties arising from such interests and activities, could divert the attention of such directors from our operations. Additionally, certain of our directors are engaged in investment and other activities in which they may learn of real estate and other related opportunities in their non-director capacities. Our board of directors has adopted resolutions applicable to our directors that expressly provide, as permitted by Section 122(17) of the DGCL, that our non-employee directors are not obligated to limit their interests or activities in their non-director capacities or to notify us of any opportunities that may arise in connection therewith, even if the opportunities are complementary to or in competition with our businesses. Accordingly, we have, and investors in our common stock should have, no expectation that we will be able to learn of or participate in such opportunities. Additionally, the relationship agreement with Brookfield Asset Management Inc. contains significant exclusions from Brookfield's obligations to present opportunities to us. Liquidity Risks Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and operating flexibility As of December 31, 2013, we have $19.0 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding at our proportionate share, net of noncontrolling interest, which includes $51.8 million under our revolving credit facility, $3.2 billion of our share of unconsolidated debt, and our Junior Subordinated Notes of $206.2 million. Our indebtedness may have important consequences to us and the value of our common stock, including: limiting our ability to borrow significant additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes; limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a portion of these funds to service debt; 13 Table of Contents increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given the portion of our indebtedness which bears interest at variable rates; limiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation; and giving secured lenders the ability to foreclose on our assets. Our debt contains restrictions and covenants which may limit our ability to enter into or obtain funding for certain transactions or operate our business The terms of certain of our debt will require us to satisfy certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and to meet financial ratios and tests, including ratios and tests based on leverage, interest coverage and net worth, or to satisfy similar tests as a precondition to incurring additional debt. We entered into a revolving credit facility in April 2012 that subjects us to such covenants and restrictions. The revolving credit facility was amended in October 2013, and we may draw up to $1.0 billion under it. In addition, certain of our indebtedness that was reinstated in connection with the Plan discussed in Item 1 contains restrictions. The covenants and other restrictions under our debt agreements affect, among other things, our ability to: incur indebtedness; create liens on assets; sell assets; manage our cash flows; transfer assets to other subsidiaries; make capital expenditures; engage in mergers and acquisitions; and make distributions to equity holders, including holders of our common stock. In addition, our debt contains certain terms which include restrictive operational and financial covenants and restrictions on the distribution of cash flows from properties serving as collateral for the debt. Fees and cash flow restrictions may affect our ability to fund our on-going operations from our operating cash flows and we may be limited in our operating and financial flexibility and, thus, may be limited in our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities. We may not be able to refinance, extend or repay our Consolidated debt or our portion of indebtedness of our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates As of December 31, 2013, our proportionate share of total debt, including the $206.2 million of Junior Subordinated Notes and $51.8 million under our revolving credit facility, aggregated $19.0 billion consisting of our consolidated debt, net of noncontrolling interest, of $15.8 billion combined with our share of the debt of our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates of $3.2 billion. Of our proportionate share of total debt, $1.9 billion is recourse to the Company due to guarantees or other security provisions for the benefit of the note holder. There can be no assurance that we, or the joint venture, will be able to refinance or restructure this debt on acceptable terms or otherwise, or that operations of the properties or contributions by us and/or our partners will be sufficient to repay such loans.
