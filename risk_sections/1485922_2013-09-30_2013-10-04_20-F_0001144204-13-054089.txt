The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared reflecting the redemption of 3,008,955 ordinary shares of Prime in association with the tender offer that expired on March 28, 2013 (“Extension Tender Offer”) for an aggregated purchase price of $30,149,729, and reflecting the redemption of one ordinary share of Prime in association with the tender offer that expired on September 27, 2013 (“Business Combination Tender Offer”) for an aggregated purchase price of $10.02. The aggregate number of ordinary shares redeemed represented approximately 82.4% of the Company's ordinary shares issued in connection with Prime’s initial public offering. Payment for the shares that were redeemed was made promptly. The selected unaudited pro forma financial information is provided for illustrative purposes only. The historical financial information in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the business combination and are factually supportable. The assets and liabilities are measured on their acquisition-date fair value. The historical financial information in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the business combination, are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. The historical financial statements of Prime for the year ended December 31, 2012 were prepared under U.S. GAAP and presented in U.S. dollars. For purposes of the pro forma condensed combined financial information, these statements have been converted to IFRS. Bell Group’s historical financial statements have been prepared under IFRS and presented in Euros. The historical financial statements of Seba S.r.l. (“Seba”) and NOVA S.r.l.’s (“Nova”) have also been prepared under IFRS and presented in Euros. For purposes of the pro forma condensed combined financial information, all of these statements have been translated to U.S. dollars. All of the selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included herein are therefore prepared under IFRS and presented in U.S. dollars. 4 You should not rely on the selected unaudited pro forma financial information as being indicative of the historical financial position that would have been achieved had the business combination been consummated as of December 31, 2012, or as being indicative of the historical financial results of operations that would have been achieved had the business combination been consummated on the first day of such period. See “Risk Factors” in this report for further information. We are providing the following information to aid you in your analysis of the financial aspects of the business combination. We derived the historical financial information of Prime from the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 included elsewhere in this proxy statement. We derived the historical financial information of Bell Group, Seba, and Nova (collectively as the “Targets”) from the audited combined financial statements of Bell Group for the year ended December 31, 2012. Seba, and Nova’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 are prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X (“S-X 3-14”) for the year ended December 31, 2012, included elsewhere in this proxy statement. This information should be read together with Prime’s and Targets’ audited financial statements and related notes, “Targets’ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” and “Other Information Related to Prime — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and other financial information included elsewhere in this proxy statement. The business combination will be accounted for as a forward acquisition under Acquisition method and management has concluded that Prime is the accounting acquirer based on its evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the acquisition. Some of the factors considered include immediately following completion of the transaction, the shareholders of Prime will have effective control of the post-merger entity through (1) retaining BHN LLC (“BHN”) in the form of a management agreement to manage the assets acquired and to provide investment advisory services, (2) significant representation on post-merger entity’s board of directors with 1 from Prime’s management team and 6 to be assigned by BHN with 3 (out of 6 assigned by BHN) being independent and mutually agreed upon by Prime and BHN. No management of the Targets will be anticipated to be part of Prime or BHN’s management team or board of directors following the business combination. In addition, the Bell Group has been determined to be the predecessor in this business combination due to its relative larger assets, operating revenue and expenses size in comparison to Seba and Nova. Accordingly, the combined assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Bell Group will become the historical financial statements of post-merger entity at the closing of the transaction, and Prime’s assets (primarily cash and cash equivalents), liabilities and results of operations will be consolidated with Targets’ assets, liabilities and results of operations on the closing date of the business combination. The Targets’ assets and liabilities are measured at their acquisition-date fair value and no material change to the fair value is expected at closing. The purchase price is allocated over the fair value of assets and liabilities purchased with any excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired recorded as goodwill. All direct costs of the transaction will be charged to operations in the period that such costs are incurred. Actual results could differ from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information presented. 5 As of December 31, Balance Sheet Data 2012 Working capital $(8,651,103) Total assets 91,706,939 Total liabilities 70,766,956 Value of ordinary shares which may be redeemed for cash ($10.02 per share) - Shareholders’ equity 20,939,983 Selected statement of operation data: For the year ended December 31, 2012 Operating expenses $19,286,642 Total operating expenses 19,286,642 Net profit/(loss) (13,991,788) Weighted average shares outstanding 3,605,344 Basic and diluted net profit/(loss) per share (3.88) B.Capitalization and Indebtedness Not required.
