Risk factors are moderate, and the impact of any adverse business and economic factors is expected to be small. The A rating category is the third highest of eight financial strength categories, which range from AAA to D. The symbol (+) or (−) may be appended to a rating to indicate the relative position of a credit within a rating category. These suffixes are not added to ratings in the AAA category or to ratings below the CCC category. Accordingly, the A+ rating is the fifth highest of Fitchs 21 financial strength ratings categories. Fitch issuer default ratings range from AAA (highest credit quality) to D (default). Fitch describes its A− issuer default rating as high credit quality, which denotes an expectation of low default risk, but may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than higher ratings. A.M. Best, S&P, Moodys and Fitch review their ratings periodically and we cannot provide assurance that we will maintain our current ratings in the future. Other agencies may rate Symetra or our insurance subsidiaries on a solicited or unsolicited basis. 21 Table of Contents The ratings included in the table above are not designed to be, and do not serve as, measures of protection or valuation offered to investors. These ratings should not be relied on with respect to making an investment in our securities. Regulation Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. Our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws. Insurance products that constitute securities, such as variable annuities and variable life insurance, also are subject to federal and state securities laws and regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and state securities authorities regulate these products. Our broker-dealers are subject to federal and state securities and related laws. The SEC, FINRA and state securities authorities are the principal regulators of these operations. The purpose of the laws and regulations affecting our insurance and securities businesses is primarily to protect our customers and not our noteholders or stockholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. In addition, insurance and securities regulatory authorities make inquiries of us regarding compliance with insurance, securities and other laws and regulations. We cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective action when warranted. Many of our customers and agents also operate in regulated environments. Changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or to distribute our products. Insurance Regulation Our insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all states in which they conduct insurance business. The extent of this regulation varies, but most states have laws and regulations governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling. In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates for certain lines of insurance. The types of insurance laws and regulations applicable to us or our insurance subsidiaries are described below. Insurance Holding Company Regulation All states in which our insurance subsidiaries conduct insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each insurance company in a holding company system, except captive insurance companies, to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its state of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority financial and other information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. These laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates. Generally, these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurers statutory surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate in relation to its financial needs. Statutory 22 Table of Contents surplus is the excess of admitted assets over statutory liabilities. For certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, these laws and regulations require prior notification to, and approval or non-disapproval by, the insurance regulatory authority of the insurers state of domicile. Policy Forms Our insurance subsidiaries policy forms are subject to regulation in every state in which such subsidiaries are licensed to transact insurance business. In most states, policy forms must be filed prior to their use. Dividend Limitations As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, Symetra depends on dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries as the principal source of cash to meet its obligations, including the payment of interest on and repayment of principal of any debt obligations and payment of dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. The payment of dividends or other distributions to Symetra by its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile. In the state of Washington, the state of domicile of Symetras principal insurance subsidiary, Symetra Life Insurance Company, an insurance company subsidiary may not pay an extraordinary dividend or distribution until 30 days after the insurance commissioner has received sufficient notice of the intended payment and has approved or not objected to the payment within the 30-day period. An extraordinary dividend or distribution is defined under Washington law as a dividend or distribution that, together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of:  10% of the insurers statutory surplus as of the immediately prior year end; or  the statutory net gain from the insurers operations for the prior year. State laws and regulations also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its statutory surplus or require the insurer to obtain regulatory approval before it may do so. In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to Symetra (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services) if they determine that such payment could be adverse to policyholders or contract holders. Market Conduct Regulation Our business is subject to extensive laws and regulations that are administered and/or enforced by a number of different governmental and non-governmental self-regulatory bodies, and include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers, product illustrations, advertising, product replacement, suitability, sales and underwriting practices, complaint handling and claims handling. State authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. Statutory Examinations As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records, accounts and business practices of insurers domiciled in their jurisdictions. These examinations generally are conducted in cooperation with the insurance departments of several other states under guidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC. In the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, we have not received any material adverse findings resulting from any insurance department examinations of our insurance subsidiaries; however, the period remains subject to examination. The Washington and New York state insurance departments recently began 23 Table of Contents examinations of our insurance subsidiaries for the five and three years ended December 31, 2010, respectively. To date, we have not received any material adverse findings from these examinations. Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements Most states require life insurers licensed to write insurance within the state to participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies of insurers who become impaired or insolvent. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. Change of Control The laws and regulations of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require that a person obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurance companys jurisdiction of domicile prior to acquiring control of the insurer. Generally, such laws provide that control over an insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control involving us, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable. Policy and Contract Reserve Sufficiency Analysis Under the laws and regulations of their states of domicile, our life insurance subsidiaries are required to conduct annual analyses of the sufficiency of their life and health insurance and annuity statutory reserves. In addition, other jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries are licensed may have certain reserve requirements that differ from those of their domiciliary jurisdictions. In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion that states that the aggregate statutory reserves, when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such reserves, make good and sufficient provision for the associated contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot be provided, the affected insurer must set up additional reserves by moving funds from surplus. Our life insurance subsidiaries submit these opinions annually to applicable insurance regulatory authorities. Surplus and Capital Requirements Insurance regulators have the discretionary authority, in connection with the ongoing licensing of our insurance subsidiaries, to limit or prohibit the ability of an insurer to issue new policies if, in the regulators judgment, the insurer is not maintaining a minimum amount of surplus or is in hazardous financial condition. Insurance regulators may also limit the ability of an insurer to issue new life insurance policies and annuity contracts above an amount based upon the face amount and premiums of policies of a similar type issued in the prior year. We do not believe that the current or anticipated levels of statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries present a material risk that any such regulator would limit the amount of new policies that our insurance subsidiaries may issue. Risk-based Capital The NAIC has established risk-based capital standards for life insurance companies as well as a model act with the intention that these standards be applied at the state level. The model act provides that life insurance companies must submit an annual risk-based capital report to state regulators reporting their risk-based capital based upon four categories of risk: asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk. For each category, the capital requirement is determined by applying factors to various asset, premium and 24 Table of Contents reserve items, with the factor being higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The formula is intended to be used by insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify possible weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action. If an insurers risk-based capital falls below specified levels, the insurer would be subject to different degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level. These actions range from requiring the insurer to propose actions to correct the capital deficiency to placing the insurer under regulatory control. As of December 31, 2010, the risk-based capital of each of our life insurance subsidiaries exceeded the level of risk-based capital that would require any of them to take or become subject to any corrective action. As of December 31, 2010, Symetra Life Insurance Company had a risk-based capital ratio of approximately 480%. Statutory Accounting Principles Statutory accounting principles, or SAP, is a basis of accounting developed by state insurance regulators to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurance companies. In developing SAP, insurance regulators were primarily concerned with assuring an insurers ability to pay all its current and future obligations to policyholders. As a result, statutory accounting focuses on conservatively valuing the assets and liabilities of insurers, generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurers domiciliary state. Uniform statutory accounting practices are established by the NAIC and generally adopted by regulators in the various states. These accounting principles and related regulations determine, among other things, the amounts our insurance subsidiaries may pay to us as dividends. The values for assets, liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP are usually different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under SAP. Regulation of Investments Each of our insurance subsidiaries is subject to laws and regulations that require diversification of its investment portfolio and limit the amount of investments in certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed maturities, real estate, equity investments and derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring surplus, and, in some instances, would require divestiture of such non-complying investments. We believe the investments held by our insurance subsidiaries comply with these laws and regulations. Federal Regulation Our variable life insurance and variable annuity products generally are securities within the meaning of federal and state securities laws. As a result, certain of our products are required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and are subject to regulation by the SEC, FINRA and state securities authorities. Federal and state securities regulation similar to that discussed below under  Other Laws and RegulationsSecurities Regulation affect investment advice, sales and related activities with respect to these products. Although the federal government does not comprehensively regulate the business of insurance, federal legislation and administrative policies in several other areas, including taxation, privacy regulation, financial services regulation and pension and welfare benefits regulation, can also significantly affect the insurance industry. From time to time, federal measures are proposed that may significantly affect the insurance business, including direct federal regulation of insurance through an optional federal charter, limitations on antitrust immunity, tax incentives for lifetime annuity payouts, simplification bills affecting tax-advantaged or tax exempt savings and retirement vehicles, and proposals to further modify the federal estate tax, the Patient 25 Table of Contents Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act. We cannot predict whether these or other proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals may have on our business. Changes in Tax Laws Existing federal laws and regulations provide favorable tax treatment to certain insurance products we offer. Congress, from time to time, considers legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefits derived from the tax advantages within life insurance and annuity products. If existing federal laws and regulations are revised to reduce this favorable tax treatment or to increase the tax-deferred status of competing products, we, along with other life insurance companies, will be adversely affected with respect to our ability to sell such products. Furthermore, although Congress has reinstated the estate tax for 2011 and 2012, Congress also considers from time to time the repeal of the federal estate tax which may adversely affect sales and surrenders of our life insurance products. Other Laws and Regulations Securities Regulation Certain of our subsidiaries and certain policies and contracts offered by them are subject to various levels of regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the SEC. One of our subsidiaries is an investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Certain of its employees are licensed as investment advisory representatives in the states where those employees have clients. Some of our insurance company separate accounts are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Some annuity contracts and insurance policies issued by some of our subsidiaries are funded by separate accounts, the interests in which are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. Certain of our subsidiaries are registered and regulated as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are members of, and subject to regulation by FINRA, as well as various state and local regulators. The registered representatives of our broker-dealers are also regulated by the SEC and FINRA and are also subject to applicable state and local laws. In January 2011, the SEC staff released the results of a study on investment advisors and broker-dealers, and recommended adoption of a uniform fiduciary standard that would apply to both investment advisors and broker-dealers. We cannot predict the precise nature of which regulations, if any, will result from the study, but they could impact the manner in which certain of our businesses operate and how certain of our distributors sell our products. The laws and regulations noted in the preceding paragraph are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets and generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include suspension of individual employees, suspension or limitation of sales of our products, limitations on the activities in which the investment adviser or broker-dealer may engage, suspension or revocation of the investment adviser or broker-dealer registration, censure or fines. We may also be subject to similar laws and regulations in the states in which we provide investment advisory services, offer the products described above, or conduct other securities-related activities. Certain of our subsidiaries also sponsor and manage investment vehicles and issue annuities that rely on certain exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Act of 1933. Nevertheless, certain provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Act of 1933 apply to these investment vehicles and the securities issued by such vehicles. The Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Securities Act of 1933, including the rules promulgated thereunder, are subject to change, which may affect our subsidiaries that sponsor and manage such investment vehicles. Our costs may increase or we may exit markets to the extent certain of our vehicles and annuities are required to comply with increased regulation and liability under the securities laws. 26 Table of Contents Employee Retirement Income Security Act and Internal Revenue Code Considerations We provide certain products and services to certain employee benefits plans that are subject to Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, or the Internal Revenue Code. As such, our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries and the requirement under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions with persons who have certain relationships with respect to such plans. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code are subject to enforcement by the U.S. Department of Labor, the IRS and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Privacy of Consumer Information U.S. federal and state laws and regulations require financial institutions, including insurance companies, to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer financial information and to notify consumers about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of consumer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Similarly, federal and state laws and regulations also govern the disclosure and security of consumer health information. In particular, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulate the disclosure and use of protected health information by health insurers and others, the physical and procedural safeguards employed to protect the security of that information and the electronic transmission of such information. Congress and state legislatures are expected to consider additional legislation relating to privacy and other aspects of consumer information. Employees As of March 11, 2011, we had approximately 1,100 full-time and part-time employees. We believe our employee relations are satisfactory. Available Information Symetras annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available free of charge on Symetras Investor Relations website, which can be accessed at www.symetra.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Additionally, copies of Symetras annual report will be made available, free of charge, upon written request. Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business Fluctuations in interest rates and interest rate spreads could impact sales, profitability or cash flows of interest-rate sensitive products. Certain of our insurance and investment products, such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance, are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Changes in interest rates may make our products less attractive to customers seeking higher yields, which could adversely impact our sales or trigger increased surrenders and withdrawals. For example, when the initial guaranteed interest rate period for fixed annuity products expires, we may significantly decrease renewal crediting rates below the initial rates, which may impact our ability to obtain and retain business. Fluctuations in interest rates may also reduce the spread, or the difference between the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations and the amounts that we must credit to policyholders and contract holders, which could adversely impact the profitability of those products and therefore our results of operations. Reductions in expected profitability or increased surrenders and 27 Table of Contents withdrawals may require us to accelerate amortization of associated deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, and deferred sales inducements, or DSI, balances, further decreasing our results of operations. Prolonged periods of low interest rates Prolonged periods of low interest rates may have a negative impact on our ability to sell products that are dependent on interest earnings, such as fixed annuity and universal life products, as consumers look for other high-yielding investment vehicles to fund retirement. In low interest rate environments, such as we experienced during 2010, it is difficult to offer attractive rates and benefits to customers while maintaining profitability, which may limit sales growth of interest sensitive products. Sustained declines in interest rates may subject us to lower returns on our invested assets, as well as increased prepayments on existing investments with embedded call options, which may reduce our net investment income and compress the spread on our interest-rate sensitive products. This risk is exacerbated by guaranteed minimum crediting rates established by our contracts and/or regulatory authorities, and restrictions on the timing and frequency with which we can adjust our crediting rates. The performance of our long-term income annuities and BOLI products is also sensitive to the investment yields on our invested assets backing such products. In extreme situations, the investments yield earned could be lower than the credited rates guaranteed to the customers. We may not be able to successfully manage interest rate spreads or the potential negative impact of those risks. Our interest rate spreads and associated investment margins vary by product as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions) Fixed deferred annuities: Interest rate spread 1.87 % 1.81 % Investment margin $169.9 $134.8 Income annuities, including structured settlements: Interest rate spread 0.57 % 0.53 % Investment margin $40.2 $38.4 Universal life: Interest rate spread 1.50 % 1.20 % Investment margin $12.1 $10.2 BOLI: BOLI return on assets 1.03 % 1.08 % Return on assets margin $44.4 $43.4 Our term life insurance products also expose us to the risk of interest rate fluctuations. The pricing and expected future profitability of these products are based in part on expected investment returns. Over time, term life insurance products generally produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums, which we invest as received. Lower than expected interest rates may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins on these products. We mitigate some of the aforementioned risks by reducing guaranteed minimum crediting rates offered on new business and, for our deferred annuity products, lowering up-front commissions. However, sustained low interest rates may require us to limit offerings of certain products. 28 Table of Contents Periods of rising interest rates We are also subject to risks associated with periods of rising interest rates. During such times, we may offer higher crediting rates on new sales of interest-sensitive products and increase crediting rates on existing in force products to maintain or enhance product competitiveness. We may not be able to purchase enough higher yielding assets necessary to fund higher crediting rates and maintain our desired spread, which could result in lower profitability on our in force business. In rising interest rate environments, especially when interest rates are rapidly rising, it may be difficult to position our products to offer attractive rates and benefits to customers while maintaining profitability, which may limit sales growth of interest sensitive products. In order to maintain sales growth of interest sensitive products and retain in force customers, we may offer higher renewal crediting rates which would impact profitability. In addition, periods of rising interest rates may cause increased policy surrenders, withdrawals and requests for policy loans on deferred annuity and BOLI products, as policyholders and contract holders seek investments with higher returns. The resulting liquidity demands may require us to sell assets that could cause realization of capital losses, particularly in the event of a sudden rise in interest rates. We may also be required to accelerate the amortization of DAC and DSI related to surrendered contracts, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in yield curves Shifts in the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates, or yield curve, can also impact our ability to sell our products, particularly fixed annuities. When the yield curve is relatively flat or negatively sloped (i.e., high short-term rates as compared to long-term rates), customers can receive similar crediting rates on competing products, such as certificates of deposit, which have shorter required investment periods. Customers may be more likely to choose those competing products than our annuities, which tend to be longer term in nature. Our investment portfolio is subject to various interest rate, credit and liquidity risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets, reduce investment returns and/or erode capital. The performance of our investment portfolio depends in part upon the level of and changes in interest rates and credit spreads, the overall performance of the economy, the creditworthiness of the specific obligors included in our portfolio, equity prices, liquidity and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors could materially affect our investment results in any period. As of December 31, 2010, our total investments were $23.5 billion, of which $21.3 billion were fixed maturities. Our fixed maturities portfolio generated net investment income of $1,119.9 million and $1,048.1 million, and realized gains (losses) of $16.8 million and $(74.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest rate and credit spread risk Interest rates and credit spreads are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, general investor sentiment, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates may cause actual net investment income or cash flows to differ from those originally anticipated for investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other securities with embedded call options. In periods of declining interest rates, prepayments generally increase. Mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and other bonds in our investment portfolio may be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates. If unanticipated, such prepayments may require us to accelerate amortization on investments purchased at a premium, which could decrease our net investment income. Additionally, we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest-bearing investments. Current concerns over foreclosures could lead to government intervention in the United States residential mortgage market, resulting in large numbers of refinancing and prepayments. As of December 31, 2010, we held $3,801.6 million in residential mortgage-backed securities, 29 Table of Contents including gross unamortized premiums of $76.9 million, and an increase in prepayments could significantly accelerate our premium amortization and result in asset reinvestment at lower interest rates. We include an estimate of future principal prepayments in the calculation of effective yields for mortgage-backed securities Differences between the actual and estimated timing of the principal prepayments impact our investment income and may reduce our overall interest rate spread. As prepayments increase in periods of declining interest rates, premium amortization accelerates because the expected life of the asset is shortened. In periods of rising interest rates, prepayments generally slow, and discount amortization slows because the expected life of the asset is extended. These changes in amortization may adversely affect our investment income. In addition, net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease in step with interest rates and credit spreads. In periods of low interest rates, such as we experienced during 2010, we may be challenged to find attractive yields on new investments. During 2010, we mitigated this risk by increasing our originations of commercial mortgage loans, which generally provided higher yields than new fixed maturities securities; however, we may be unable to continue to find appropriate loan opportunities meeting our high quality standards. The fair value of our fixed maturities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with changes in interest rates and credit spreads. Because all of our fixed maturities are classified as available-for-sale, changes in the fair value of these securities are reflected as a component of comprehensive income. A rise in interest rates may cause the fair value of our fixed maturity securities to decline, particularly for our long-duration investments supporting our Income Annuities reserves. Declines in fair value may decrease unrealized gains or result in unrealized losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), and decrease our stockholders equity. Further, U.S. GAAP does not require similar fair value accounting treatment for the insurance liabilities that the fixed maturities support. Therefore, changes in the fair value of our fixed maturities caused by interest rate fluctuations are not offset in whole or in part by similar adjustments to the fair value of our insurance liabilities on the balance sheet. We mitigate the risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and credit spreads by employing asset-to-liability matching strategies to ensure that cash flows are available to pay claims as they become due. However, these strategies may fail to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of interest rate and credit spread volatility. Credit risk Issuers of the fixed maturities we own may default on principal and interest payments. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income or cause realized investment losses. Further, fixed maturities are evaluated for impairment based on our assumptions about the creditworthiness of the issuer. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we incurred $15.3 million and $57.8 million in credit-related impairments, respectively. A significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturities portfolio could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The determination of impairments is subject to managements judgment about the creditworthiness and continued cash flows of a security. While we have controls and procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that our impairment analysis is complete and based on accurate information, actual cash flows and defaults may vary significantly from our assumptions. As of December 31, 2010, 5.9% of our total fixed maturity portfolio at fair value was considered below investment grade. Below investment grade securities generally provide higher expected returns but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities. Further, an issuers inability to refinance or pay off debt could cause certain of our investment-grade maturities to present more significant credit risk than when we first invested. Private equity and highly leveraged buyouts could also cause certain of our investment-grade fixed maturities to present more significant credit risk than when we first invested. 30 Table of Contents Issuers of the fixed maturities that we own may experience threats and performance deterioration that trigger rating agency downgrades. Although the issuers may not have defaulted on principal and interest payments with respect to these securities, we may be required by regulators and rating agencies to hold more capital in support of these investments. We could experience higher cost of capital and potential constraints on our ability to grow our business and maintain our own ratings. For further information on our fixed maturities portfolio and credit-related impairments, see Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsInvestments. Liquidity risk Our investments in privately placed fixed maturities, mortgage loans, policy loans and limited partnership interests, which collectively represented approximately 12% of total invested assets as of December 31, 2010, are relatively illiquid compared to publicly traded fixed maturities and equities. In addition, periods of market disruption, such as those experienced in the past three years, could also reduce liquidity for securities generally considered to be readily marketable. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. This risk is mitigated by the liquidity structure of our underlying reserves, of which 85.4% are considered illiquid or somewhat illiquid. For further information on the liquidity of our underlying reserves, see Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources. Defaults in our commercial mortgage loans may adversely affect our profitability. Our mortgage loans, which are collateralized by commercial properties, are subject to default risk. During 2010, we began strategically increasing our mortgage loan portfolio and originated $592.1 million of new loans, compared to $290.8 million originated in 2009. We carry our mortgage loans at outstanding principal balances, adjusted for unamortized deferred fees and costs, net of an allowance for loan losses. Our allowance includes a reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses in the portfolio, and specific reserves for any non-performing loans. The reserve for probable incurred losses is based on our historical experience, third party data for expected losses on loans with similar loan-to-value, and debt service coverage ratios. Specific reserves are determined by comparing the carrying value of the loan to the expected future cash flows, discounted at the loans effective interest rate, or the fair value of the underlying collateral, if the loan is collateral-dependent. These reserves are estimates and may not be sufficient to cover actual losses. As of December 31, 2010, no loans were classified as non-performing. However, due to the uncertain economic environment and the growth in our portfolio, the performance of our mortgage loan portfolio may decline in the future. In addition, the majority of our loans have balloon payment maturities, which may trigger future defaults on currently performing loans. An increase in the default rate of our mortgage loan investments, caused by current or worsening economic conditions or otherwise, could result in realized losses or increases in our allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, any geographic concentration of our commercial mortgage loans may expose us to higher risk of adverse effects on our loan portfolio and, consequently, on our results of operations or financial condition. While we seek to mitigate this risk by having a diversified portfolio, events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or economic sector may have a greater adverse effect on our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2010, 31.0% of our commercial mortgage loans were located in California, 15.7% were located in Washington and 9.8% were located in Texas. 31 Table of Contents For additional information on our mortgage loan portfolio, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsInvestmentsMortgage Loans. Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities may become realized or result in future impairments, resulting in a reduction in our net income. Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at their estimated fair value and compose a significant portion of our total assets. Liquidity needs, portfolio rebalancing, or other reasons may require us to sell these securities prior to maturity, or credit concerns could prompt us to conclude that a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary. The resulting realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income. Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of AOCI and are therefore excluded from net income. The accumulated change in estimated fair value of these available-for-sale securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon the sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary and an impairment charge is taken. Our gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities as of December 31, 2010 were $305.8 million. The portion of the gross unrealized losses for fixed maturity and equity securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below amortized cost or cost by 20% or more for six months or greater was $40.6 million as of December 31, 2010. Our valuation of fixed maturity securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Fixed maturities are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and represent approximately 91% of our invested assets as of December 31, 2010. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation models using unobservable inputs (Level 3). Level 2 and Level 3 measurements compose a significant portion of our invested assets; as of December 31, 2010, approximately $20.4 billion, or 96%, of our fixed maturities were categorized as Level 2 measurements, and $0.9 billion, or 4%, were categorized as Level 3. Because values for securities classified as Level 2 and Level 3 are not based on quoted market prices for identical instruments, the amount we realize upon settlement or maturity may differ significantly from our reported fair value. Additionally, multiple valuation methods may be applicable to a security, and the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value amounts. Decreases in valuations may result in unrealized losses recorded in stockholders equity or realized losses recorded in net income, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our Level 2 measurements are obtained from our pricing services and derived from models that use objectively verifiable, observable market inputs, such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other reference data, including market research publications. Because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis, evaluated pricing models apply available information through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. If such information about a security is unavailable, we determine the fair value using internal pricing models that typically utilize significant, unobservable market inputs or inputs that are difficult to corroborate with observable market data. As of December 31, 2010, $892.9 million, or 4.2%, of our fixed maturities portfolio was invested in private placement securities, which are not actively traded. The fair values of $815.4 million, or 91.3%, of these assets are classified as Level 3, as they are determined using a discounted cash flow approach that requires the use of inputs that are not market-observable and involves significant judgment. 32 Table of Contents During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities (for example, corporate private placements) if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. In such cases, valuations for those securities may require more subjectivity and management judgment, including valuation methods, inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation. Rapidly changing and adverse credit and equity market conditions could also materially impact the valuation of securities reported in our consolidated financial statements, and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. To mitigate these risks, we use established, industry-standard valuation models consistently from period-to-period. For more information on our valuation methodology for invested assets, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, our investment management objective is to support the expected cash flows of our liabilities and to produce stable returns over the long term; thus, we typically hold our fixed maturities until maturity or until market conditions are favorable for the sale of such investments. Downturns and volatility in equity markets could adversely affect our profitability. We recognize changes in fair value of our investments in certain common stock or other equity-like securities in net income, through net realized investment gains (losses). These investments, which generally provide higher expected total returns over the long term, present a greater risk to preservation of principal than our fixed maturity investments. As of December 31, 2010, less than two percent of our invested assets were invested in securities whose changes in fair value are typically highly correlated with changes in the equity markets. While these investments do not represent a significant portion of our invested assets, a decline in the equity markets could have a significant adverse effect on our net income, and also increase volatility in results between periods. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2008, net losses on our equity securities trading portfolio were $64.5 million, as the S&P 500 Total Return Index declined 37% that year. In the following year ending December 31, 2009, net gains were $36.4 million on the portfolio, as the S&P 500 Total Return Index improved nearly 27%. For the year ended December 31, 2010, net gains on our equity securities trading portfolio were $32.6 million, as the S&P 500 Total Return Index rose approximately 15% for the year. We may face unanticipated losses if we determine our reserves for future policy benefits and claims are inadequate, or there are significant deviations from our pricing assumptions. We calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future benefit payments to our policyholders and contract holders in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which are released as those future obligations are extinguished. The reserves we establish are estimates, primarily based on actuarial assumptions with regard to our future experience, which involve the exercise of significant judgment. Our future financial results depend upon the extent to which our actual future experience is consistent with the assumptions we have used in pricing our products and determining our reserves. Many factors can affect future experience, including economic, political and social conditions, mortality and morbidity, persistency, inflation, healthcare costs and changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation. Therefore, we cannot predict the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual future benefits or the timing of those payments. Health care costs in particular have risen substantially in recent history and may continue to do so. Our medical stop-loss products provide coverage for claims exceeding certain dollar thresholds for either individual or aggregate claims, and increased medical costs may result in higher claims. While we monitor claims costs and changes that may affect future costs, such as medical inflation, changing demographics and changes in the mix of our business, increases in medical costs may exceed our expectations or may not be properly factored into our pricing. This could adversely affect the results of operations in our Group segment. 33 Table of Contents Persistency is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next. For most of our products, actual persistency that is lower than our assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability, especially in the early years of a policy or contract primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract. In addition, we may need to sell investments at a loss to fund withdrawals. For some of our life insurance policies, actual persistency in later policy durations that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability. If these policies remain in force longer than we assumed, then we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced these products. In addition, we set prices for our insurance and certain annuity products based upon expected claims and payment patterns, using assumptions for, among other factors, morbidity rates and mortality rates of our policyholders and contract holders. The long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions. For example, if morbidity rates are higher or mortality rates are lower than our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments under certain annuity contracts than we had projected. Our largest exposure to morbidity risk is in our medical stop-loss products, which we mitigate through reinsurance. For example, our specific stop-loss business is 100% reinsured for claims above $1.1 million. Our largest exposure to mortality risk is in our Life segment, which we also mitigate through reinsurance. Additionally, a general increase in mortality would be favorable to our Income Annuities segment, as we may pay fewer benefits than expected. We regularly monitor our reserves and review our assumptions. If we conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claims payments, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges in the period in which we make that determination, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. There were no significant adjustments to reserves due to inadequacy during 2010 or 2009. Although certain of our products permit us to increase premiums or reduce benefits or crediting rates during the life of the policy or contract, these changes may not be sufficient to maintain profitability, or may reduce the attractiveness of our products relative to competitors. Moreover, many of our products either do not permit us to increase premiums or reduce benefits or may limit those changes during the life of the policy or contract. Therefore, significant deviations in experience from our assumptions regarding persistency, mortality and morbidity rates could have an adverse affect on our profitability. We may face unanticipated losses if we are required to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and/or deferred sales inducements if there are significant deviations in actual experience or in anticipated assumptions. Deferred policy acquisition costs represent certain costs that vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our products and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related contracts. These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, certain sales incentives, and other costs such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses. Deferred sales inducements represent bonus interest and excess interest mainly on our fixed deferred annuity products, which are deferred and reported in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized as interest credited over the estimated life of the related contracts. Under U.S. GAAP, DAC and DSI are amortized through income over the lives of the underlying contracts in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums or gross profits for most of our products. As of December 31, 2010, we had $250.0 million of DAC and $61.8 million of DSI. Our amortization of DAC and DSI generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments, crediting rates, surrender and other policy and contract charges, mortality, morbidity and maintenance and 34 Table of Contents expense margins. Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, crediting rates, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals or lapses may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC and DSI, resulting in higher expenses and lower profitability. Our assumptions, including those related to expenses, investment returns, credited interest rates, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals or lapse experience among others, are adjusted quarterly to reflect actual experience to date. For future assumptions, we conduct a study to refine our estimates of future gross profits on an annual basis during the third quarter. Upon completion of this study, we revise our assumptions and update our DAC models to reflect our current best estimate. Changes in our actual experience or our expected future experience may result in increased amortization of DAC or DSI, which would increase our expenses and reduce profitability. We regularly review our DAC and DSI asset balances to determine if it is recoverable from future income. The portion of the DAC and DSI asset balances deemed to be unrecoverable, if any, is charged to expense in the period in which we make this determination. For example, if we determine that we are unable to recover DAC or DSI from profits over the life of a book of business of insurance policies or annuity contracts, we would be required to recognize the unrecoverable DAC or DSI amortization as a current-period expense. For further information on our DAC accounting policy, see Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs. Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements. Our financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised by recognized authorities, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Recently, the FASB issued revised guidance for DAC, which limits the costs that are eligible for deferral. This guidance is effective for our 2012 fiscal year and may result in more acquisition costs being expensed as incurred, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, we may retrospectively adopt this guidance, which would decrease our historical DAC asset and retained earnings balances presented in our future financial statements and decrease future DAC amortization. In addition, the FASB is developing new guidance for accounting for insurance contracts, which would measure liabilities for insurance contracts based on the present value of estimated future cash flows to fulfill the contract. This could change the recognition and measurement of insurance obligations on our statement of financial position and impact the timing of the related income in our results of operations. The FASB is also drafting new guidance for financial instruments which, as currently proposed, would change the way credit losses for financial assets are measured. If adopted, these and other future accounting standards could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements, and such changes could have an adverse effect on our reported financial condition and results of operations. A downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength ratings could result in a loss of business. Financial strength ratings, which various ratings organizations publish as measures of an insurance companys ability to meet contract holder and policyholder obligations, are important to maintaining public confidence in our company and our products, and the ability to market our products and our competitive position. Additionally, our structured settlement products are typically purchased during lawsuit settlements for the benefit of injured claimants and the purchase must be approved by the courts, which place significant reliance on financial strength ratings. A downgrade in our financial strength ratings, or the announced potential for a downgrade, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in several ways, including:  reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and other investment products; 35 Table of Contents  limiting our ability to offer structured settlement products;  increasing our cost of capital;  adversely affecting our relationships with independent sales intermediaries and our dedicated sales specialists;  materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contract holders and policyholders;  requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive; and  adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance. We rely on reinsurance arrangements to help manage our business risks, and failure to perform by the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements may expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate. We utilize reinsurance to mitigate our risks in various circumstances, primarily related to our individual life and group products. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. The total reinsurance recoverables due from reinsurers was $280.8 million as of December 31, 2010, of which $109.9 million was recoverable from our single largest reinsurer. Our reinsurers may be unable or unwilling to pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us now or in the future or on a timely basis. A reinsurers insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Reinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses. As part of our overall risk management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments. While reinsurance agreements generally bind the reinsurer for the life of the business reinsured at generally fixed pricing, market conditions beyond our control can determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection for new business. In certain circumstances, the price of reinsurance for business already reinsured may also increase. Any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will reduce our earnings. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to those policies we issue. For further discussion on our reinsurance program, see Item 1BusinessReinsurance. We may be unable to attract and retain independent sales intermediaries and dedicated sales specialists which could result in a reduction in sales or a loss of business. We distribute our products through financial intermediaries, independent producers and dedicated sales specialists. We compete with other financial institutions to attract and retain commercial relationships in each of these channels, and our success in competing for sales through these sales intermediaries depends upon factors such as:  the amount of sales commissions and fees we pay;  the breadth of our product offerings;  the design and positioning of our product offerings; 36 Table of Contents  the adjustments we make in premium or interest crediting rates;  the strength of our brand;  our perceived stability and our financial strength ratings;  the marketing and services we provide to them; and  the strength of the relationships we maintain with individuals at those firms. Through time our relationship with distributors may deteriorate due to any of the above factors, which could result in a drop in sales and/or a loss of existing business due to higher surrender activity. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to existing and potential distribution partners to favor their products or to reduce sales of our products. Our contracts with our distribution partners generally allow either party to terminate the relationship upon short notice. Our distribution partners do not make minimum purchase commitments, and our contracts do not prohibit our partners from offering products that compete with ours. Accordingly, our distribution partners may choose not to offer our products exclusively or at all, or may choose to exert insufficient resources and attention to selling our products. Sales from our top five distribution partners accounted for approximately 42% of our total sales in 2010. If our relationships with these distributors were to deteriorate, it is likely that we would experience a decline in our sales. Turbulent economic conditions may also impair our distribution partners, which would have an adverse impact on our sales. Further, consolidation of financial institutions could increase competition for access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses, and impair our ability to market our products to our current customer base or to expand our customer base. From time to time, due to competitive forces, we may also experience unusually high employee attrition in particular sales channels for specific products. An inability to recruit productive independent sales intermediaries and dedicated sales specialists, or our inability to retain strong relationships with the individual agents at our independent sales intermediaries, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our future success is highly dependent on maintaining and growing both existing and new distribution relationships. We may have little or no contact or brand awareness with end customers of our products, which makes it more difficult to respond to evolving customer needs and increases our reliance on our distribution partners. New executive leadership may not be able to successfully implement business strategies for growth. Our success depends upon our executive leadership teams ability to develop and implement a successful business strategy. During 2010, we announced a number of changes in our executive leadership team. While the new members of our executive leadership team are experienced in the life insurance industry, they have not worked together in their new positions with the Company and may not be able to successfully implement our new business strategies in the current economic environment. Failure to effectively integrate our new executive leadership team or failure of our new executive leadership team to implement our business strategies could materially adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operation. Intense competition could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability. Our businesses are subject to intense competition. We believe the principal competitive factors in the sale of our products are product features, price, commission structure, marketing and distribution arrangements, brand, reputation, financial strength ratings and service. Many other companies actively 37 Table of Contents compete for sales of deferred and income annuity products, group health and life insurance, including other major insurers, banks, other financial institutions, mutual fund and asset management firms and specialty providers. In many of our product lines, we face competition from companies that have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength ratings than we do. Many competitors offer similar products and use similar distribution channels. The substantial expansion of banks and insurance companies distribution capacities and expansion of product features in recent years have intensified pressure on margins and production levels and have increased the level of competition in many of our product lines, which could make it difficult to achieve our target returns. Our strategies for mitigating risks arising from our day-to-day operations may prove ineffective resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions. Our performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage risks that arise from a large number of our day-to-day business activities, including setting of premium or interest crediting rates, underwriting, claims processing, policy administration and servicing, execution of our investment strategy, financial and tax reporting, marketing and sales efforts, and other activities, many of which are complex. We also may rely on third parties for such activities. We seek to monitor and control our exposure to risks arising out of or related to these activities through a variety of internal controls, management review processes, and other mechanisms. However, the occurrence of unforeseen or un-contemplated risks, or the occurrence of risks of a greater magnitude than expected, including those arising from a failure in processes, procedures or systems implemented by us or a failure on the part of employees or third parties upon which we rely in this regard, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of natural disasters, disease pandemics, terrorism or military actions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our financial condition and results of operations are at risk of material adverse effects that could arise from catastrophic mortality and morbidity due to natural disasters, including floods, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, disease pandemics, terrorism and military actions. Such events could also lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates as policyholders and contract holders who are affected by the disaster may be unable to meet their contractual obligations, such as payment of premiums on our insurance policies or deposits into our investment products. The effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and nongovernmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of a disease pandemic could have a material impact on the losses experienced by us. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural disaster or a disease pandemic could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These could adversely impact the valuation and performance of our investment portfolio. Further, in our group health and life insurance operations, including bank-owned life insurance, a localized event that affects the workplace of one or more of our customers could cause a significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims. The majority of our operations are located in Bellevue, Washington. In the event of a catastrophic event or disaster in this area, our employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time, which may interrupt our business operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and may result in limited or no connectivity. The majority of our employees are equipped to work remotely; however certain duties, such as processing new business applications, may be difficult to perform remotely. 38 Table of Contents The failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems could adversely affect our business. We use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and use customer and company data and information. Additionally, our computer and information technology systems interface with and rely upon third-party systems. Our business is highly dependent on our ability, and the ability of our affiliates, to access these systems to perform necessary business functions, including providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, providing customer support, filing and paying claims and making changes to existing policies. We also use systems for investment management, financial reporting and data analysis to support our policyholder reserves and other actuarial estimates. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we do not maintain adequate systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including:  inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserving decisions;  inadequate information for accurate financial reporting;  increases in administrative expenses;  the loss of existing customers;  difficulty in attracting new customers;  customer, provider and agent disputes;  litigation exposure; or  regulatory compliance problems, such as failure to meet prompt payment obligations. Systems outages or outright failures would compromise our ability to perform critical functions in a timely manner. This could hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers and harm our ability to conduct business. In the event of a disaster such as a blackout, a computer virus, an industrial accident, a natural catastrophe, a terrorist attack or war, our systems may not be available to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. If our systems or our data are destroyed or disabled, employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time. Our systems could also be subject to similar disruptions due to physical and electronic break-ins or other types of unauthorized tampering with our systems. This may interrupt our business operations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have committed and will continue to commit significant resources to develop, maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. Our ability to keep our systems fully integrated with those of our clients is critical to the operation of our business, and failure to update our systems to reflect technological advancements or to protect our systems may adversely affect our relationships and ability to do business with our clients. The failure to protect our clients confidential information and privacy could adversely affect our business. A number of our businesses are subject to privacy regulations and confidentiality obligations. For example, the collection and use of patient data in our Group segment is the subject of national and state 39 Table of Contents legislation, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and certain of the activities conducted by our businesses are subject to the privacy regulations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. We also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors and clients. These obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information. The actions we take to protect confidential information vary by business segment and may include, among other things:  training and educating our employees regarding our obligations relating to confidential information;  actively monitoring our record retention plans and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements;  drafting appropriate contractual provisions into any contract that raises proprietary and confidentiality issues;  maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records;  limiting access to electronic information; and  in the event of a security breach, providing credit monitoring or other services to affected customers. In addition, we must develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information. If we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, such as penalties, fines and loss of license, as well as loss of reputation and possible litigation. This could have an adverse impact on our companys image and, therefore, result in lower sales or lapses of existing business. Our business could be interrupted or compromised if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships. We outsource certain technology and business functions to third parties, including a significant portion of our investment management and information technology functions, and expect to continue to do so in the future. When we engage a third-party vendor, we perform extensive due diligence on the vendor, including evaluations of quality of service, financial stability, compliance with laws and regulations and appropriate business continuity plans. However, if we do not maintain an effective outsourcing strategy or third-party providers do not perform as contracted, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. Our credit facility subjects us to operating and financial covenants on our operations and could limit our ability to grow our business. We entered into a $200.0 million revolving credit facility on August 16, 2007. We rely on the facility as a potential source of liquidity, which could be critical in enabling us to meet our obligations as they come due, particularly during periods when alternative sources of liquidity are limited. As of December 31, 2010, we had no balance outstanding and we have had no borrowings under this facility since it was established. In connection with this facility, we have agreed to covenants that may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness by our subsidiaries, limit the ability of us and our subsidiaries to create liens and impose certain other operating limitations. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing or take advantage of business opportunities. 40 Table of Contents Furthermore, our credit facility requires us and our insurance subsidiaries to maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we are unable to comply with the covenants and ratios in our credit facility, we may be deemed in default under the facility and unable to access it when needed, or we may be required to pay substantial fees or penalties to the lenders to obtain a waiver of any such default. Either development could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. Raising additional capital could dilute stockholder ownership in the Company and may cause the market price of our common stock to fall. We need liquidity to pay our policyholder benefits, operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock, and to pay down or replace certain debt obligations as they mature. We may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:  fund liquidity needs;  refinance our senior notes or our Capital Efficient Notes (CENts);  satisfy letter of credit or guarantee bond requirements that may be imposed by our clients or by regulators;  acquire new businesses or invest in existing businesses;  grow our business;  otherwise respond to competitive pressures;  maintain adequate risk-based capital; or  maintain our target ratings from rating agencies. Future deterioration of our capital position at a time when we are unable to access the long-term debt market could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, which may require us to:  reduce or eliminate future stockholder dividends of our common stock;  utilize unused borrowings for general corporate purposes;  undertake additional capital management activities, including reinsurance transactions;  limit or curtail sales of certain products and/or restructure existing products;  undertake asset sales or internal asset transfers; and  seek temporary or permanent changes to regulatory rules. Certain of these actions may require regulatory approval and/or the approval of counterparties, which are outside of our control or have economic costs associated with them. Actions we might take to access financing may also cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings. Further, in connection with the CENts 41 Table of Contents offering, we entered into a covenant that may limit our ability to undertake certain additional types of financing to repay or redeem the CENts. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity will dilute each stockholders ownership percentage in our company and may decrease the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, newly issued securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior or otherwise superior to those of our common stock. Any additional financing we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations, and our business could suffer. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets may limit our access to capital required to operate our business and maintain desired financial ratios. These market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to grow our business, replace capital withdrawn by customers or raise new capital required by our subsidiaries as a result of volatility in the markets in a timely manner. As a result, we may be forced to delay raising capital, bear an unattractive cost of capital or be unable to raise capital at any price, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. As a holding company, Symetra Financial Corporation depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to transfer funds to it to meet its obligations and pay dividends. Symetra is a holding company for its insurance and financial subsidiaries with no significant operations of its own. Its principal sources of cash to meet its obligations and to pay dividends consist of dividends from its subsidiaries and permitted payments under tax sharing agreements with its subsidiaries. State insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries. Based on our statutory results as of December 31, 2010, our insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends to us of up to $194.0 million in the aggregate during 2011 without obtaining regulatory approval. Competitive pressures generally require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings, which are partly based on maintaining certain levels of capital. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements, such as minimum required risk-based capital ratios, affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Limits on the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and service our debt. There are a number of other factors that could affect our ability to pay dividends, including the following:  lack of available cash due to changes in our operating cash flow, capital expenditure requirements, working capital requirements and other cash needs;  unexpected or increased operating or other expenses or changes in the timing thereof;  restrictions under Delaware law or other applicable law on the amount of dividends that we may pay;  a decision by our board of directors to modify or revoke its policy to pay dividends; and  the other risks described in this section. Significant stockholders may be able to influence the direction of our business. Our principal stockholders, affiliates of White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., each beneficially owned approximately 21.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of March 11, 2011 (including warrants exercisable for 9,487,872 shares held by affiliates of each of White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.). Accordingly, they may have the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the nomination and election of 42 Table of Contents directors and the determination of the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including amendments to our certificate of incorporation, potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. The interests of our principal stockholders may not coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. Risks Related to Our Industry Our industry is highly regulated and changes in regulations affecting our businesses may reduce our profitability and limit our growth. Our insurance businesses are heavily regulated and are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state insurance laws and regulated by the insurance departments of the various states in which they are domiciled and licensed. State laws in the United States grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to various aspects of our insurance businesses, including:  licensing companies and agents to transact business;  calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;  mandating certain insurance benefits;  regulating certain premium rates;  reviewing and approving policy forms;  regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;  establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;  establishing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;  requiring regular market conduct examinations;  approving changes in control of insurance companies;  restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and  regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have an adverse effect on our business. Currently, the U.S. federal government does not regulate directly the business of insurance. However, the Dodd-Frank Act created a Federal Insurance Office. While the office will not directly regulate domestic insurance business, it is tasked with studying the potential efficiency and consequences of federal insurance regulation. We cannot predict what impact, if any, the results of these studies or other such proposals, if enacted, may have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, federal legislation and administrative policies in other areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance 43 Table of Contents companies, including general financial services regulation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy regulation, tort reform legislation, and taxation. Many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries also operate in regulated environments. Changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or to distribute our products. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance efforts and other expenses of doing business. U.S. federal and state securities laws apply to investment products that are also securities, including variable annuities and variable life insurance policies. As a result, some of our subsidiaries and the policies and contracts they offer are subject to regulation under these federal and state securities laws. Some of our insurance subsidiaries separate accounts are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Some subsidiaries are registered as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are members of, and subject to regulation by FINRA. In addition, one of our subsidiaries also is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. These subsidiaries may also be impacted by interpretations and rules created as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. Securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to ensure the integrity of financial markets and to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory or brokerage clients. These laws and regulations grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with those laws and regulations. Legal and regulatory investigations and actions are increasingly common in the insurance business and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation. We face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. Our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate. In our insurance operations, we may become subject to class actions and regulatory actions and we are or may become subject to individual lawsuits relating, among other things, to sales or underwriting practices, payment of contingent or other sales commissions, claims payments and procedures, product design, disclosure, administration, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, interest crediting practices, denial or delay of benefits and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. For example, the insurance industry has been the focus of increased scrutiny and lawsuits related to retained asset accounts offered to beneficiaries, which offer access to benefits through drafts on interest-bearing accounts held by the insurer in lieu of a lump-sum payout. The lawsuits allege that customers were misled about access to and security of these funds, and that insurers unjustly profited through low crediting rates offered on the accounts. The outcome of these lawsuits is unknown. As of December 31, 2010, balances held in our retained asset accounts were $71.3 million, and we have not been the subject of any inquiries or lawsuits regarding these practices. In addition, annuity sales to seniors are coming under increased scrutiny by FINRA and state insurance regulators, and have been the source of industry litigation in situations where annuity sales have allegedly been unsuitable for the seniors financial needs. We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas, market conduct exams and books and record examinations, from state and federal regulators and other authorities, which may result in fines, recommendations for corrective action or other regulatory actions. 44 Table of Contents Current or future investigations and proceedings could have an adverse effect on our business. A substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could result in new legal actions or precedents and industry-wide regulations or practices that could adversely affect our business. The implementation of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act could have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of the health insurance products that we sell. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which brings substantial change to the insurance coverage for medical costs. PPACA directly or indirectly impacts our Group medical stop-loss and limited benefit medical businesses. PPACA mandated studies that are expected to be released late in the first quarter 2011 could influence future legislation affecting self-insured health plans and, thus, our medical stop-loss business. Although our limited benefit medical product is exempt from many of the reforms mandated by PPACA due to its fixed indemnity design, it does not provide minimum essential coverage as defined under PPACA provisions effective in 2014. We will continue to monitor the implementation of PPACA and reassess our business strategies accordingly. Potential changes in tax laws could make some of our products less attractive to customers and adversely affect our results of operations. Many of the products that we sell benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current federal tax law. For example, we sell life insurance policies that benefit from the deferral or elimination of taxation on earnings accrued under the policy, as well as permanent exclusion of certain death benefits that may be paid to policyholders beneficiaries. We also sell annuity contracts that allow the policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. Congress has previously considered and may revisit legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefits derived from the tax deferred nature of life insurance and annuity products. Due in large part to the recent budget crisis affecting many governments, there is an increasing risk that federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would result in higher taxes on insurance companies and their policyholders. Although the specific form of any such potential legislation is uncertain, it could include reducing or eliminating some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting us or our policyholders. Changes to these favorable tax statuses could adversely affect our sales and lapses of current policies. In addition, changes in tax laws could increase our company tax liability and income tax expense. For example, recent federal budget proposals, if enacted, would affect the taxation of life insurance companies and certain life insurance products. In particular, those proposals include modifying the dividends-received deduction for life insurance company separate accounts and expanding the interest expense disallowance for corporate-owned life insurance. If proposals of this type were enacted, our sales could be adversely affected, primarily variable products and BOLI, and our actual tax expense could increase, reducing earnings. Failures elsewhere in the insurance industry could obligate us to pay assessments through guaranty associations. When an insurance company becomes insolvent, state insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess other insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to pay obligations to policyholders of the insolvent company, up to the state-specific limit of coverage. The total amount of the assessment is based on the number of insured residents in each state, and each companys portion is based on its proportionate share of premium volume in the relevant lines of business. The future failure of a large life, health or annuity insurer could trigger assessments which we would be obligated to pay. Further, amounts for historical insolvencies may be assessed over many years, and there can be significant uncertainty around the 45 Table of Contents total obligation for a given insolvency. Existing liabilities may not be sufficient to fund the ultimate obligations of a historical insolvency, and we may be required to increase our liability, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
